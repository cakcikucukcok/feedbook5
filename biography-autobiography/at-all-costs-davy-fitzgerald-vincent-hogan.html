  <title>At All Costs - Davy Fitzgerald, Vincent Hogan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Davy Fitzgerald is one of hurling’s defining personalities. A two-time All-Ireland winner as a player and once as a manager, he has spent the past decade consolidating a reputation as one of the most innovative and dynamic coaches in the game, first with Waterford, then with his native Clare and, most recently, with Wexford.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Davy, however, exacting in his standards and possessed of an unshakeable will to succeed, victory has always come at a cost. His playing and managerial honours, though formidable, are matched by a roll call of public controversies and private challenges every bit as lengthy and varied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this, a raw and forthright account of his time in management, Fitzgerald returns to the moments that have defined his career to date &amp;ndash; the tactics and gambles, the breakthroughs and regrets, the friendships and fallings out &amp;ndash; all the while measuring his judgement and the toll his single-minded pursuit of excellence has taken on his health and those closest to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Packed with insights and anecdotes from his time on the sidelines, &lt;i&gt;At All Costs&lt;/i&gt; is a riveting account of a career spent walking the fine line that separates commitment from obsession, and a must read for anyone who has ever wondered what it takes to compete &amp;ndash; and succeed &amp;ndash; at the highest level.&lt;/p&gt;" />
