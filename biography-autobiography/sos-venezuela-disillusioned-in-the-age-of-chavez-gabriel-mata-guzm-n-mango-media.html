  <title>SOS Venezuela: Disillusioned in the Age of Chavez - Gabriel Mata Guzmán, Mango Media</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A group of Venezuelans interested in politics experience a transformation as their views and lives start to restructure. This shifting of ideologies, a result of fourteen years of Bolivarian Revolution, is only the beginning. One of these Venezuelans, Gerardo, a journalist who covered the protests in February of 2014, is from the opposition. He is the face of the resistance and lives in a constant fear. The others supported the government of Hugo Chávez for a long time. Two of these original supporters, who started as Chavistas, are brothers. One brother is now a militant of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, and the other resigned his allegiance to Chávez after seen his quality of life degrade. Two other comrades, one member of the Socialist Party and other of the Communist Party, defend the Socialism of the twenty-first Century with their heart. The last, after being a communist much of his life, ended opposing the dictatorship in Venezuela. The disenchantment over the deception is so extreme that three of them are willing to abandon their country to immigrate to another land escaping the tarnishing of their land, the Land of Grace.  Also Available in App Format." />
