  <title>When Blanche Met Brando - Sam Staggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Exhaustively researched and almost flirtatiously opinionated, W&lt;i&gt;hen Blanche Met Brando&lt;/i&gt; is everything a fan needs to know about the ground-breaking New York and London stage productions of Williams&#39; &quot;Streetcar&quot; as well as the classic Brando/Leigh film. Sam Staggs&#39; interviews with all the living cast members of each production will enhance what&#39;s known about the play and movie, and help make this book satisfying as both a pop culture read and as a deeper piece of thinking about a well-known story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers will come away from this book delighted with the juicy behind-the-scenes stories about cast, director, playwright and the various productions and will also renew their curiosity about the connection between the role of Blanche and Viven Leigh&#39;s insatiable sexual appetite and later descent into breakdown. They may also-for the first time-question whether the character of Blanche was actually &quot;mad&quot; or whether her anxiousness was symptomatic of another disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; is one of the most haunting and most-studied modern plays. Staggs&#39; new book will fascinate fans and richen newcomers&#39; understanding of its importance in American theater and movie history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
