  <title>My Greatest Fear - Joe Lopez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joe Lopez and Nancy Sue Garside met in central California, and God knew what He was doing when He brought them together.
They married Oct. 28, 1961, and it was not a planned marriage on their part. Nancy had gotten pregnant, and when that happened, marriage was expected.
But she gave her life to her husband and her children, and Joe fell deeper in love with her every single day. The couple was married for more than fifty-one years, and when she died, it devastated the entire family.
In this look back at the wonderful life they shared together, Joe Lopez examines their family roots, and the years he spent working at a dairy creamery and custom slaughtering business before becoming a cattleman running a beautiful ranch.
When Nancy died, the author was left without any faith in God, struggling to find meaning in life. Everyone kept telling him God has something in store for you, and hed discover that was true when he confronted his greatest fear." />
