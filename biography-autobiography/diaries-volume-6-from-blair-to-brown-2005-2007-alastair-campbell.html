  <title>Diaries Volume 6: From Blair to Brown, 2005 – 2007 - Alastair Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One might have thought Alastair Campbell would disappear from view as Gordon Brown moved from No. 11 to No. 10. Far from it. Having negotiated the rapprochement which led to Brown taking a central role in the 2005 election win, Campbell then became central to the transition from one Prime Minister to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many books have already been written about Brown and Blair, but none with the intimacy and the unique perspective of Alastair Campbell. As this volume opens, Blair has just won a historic third term. But any joy is short-lived and he knows he is running out of road. By the time it ends two years later, Brown is Prime Minister.
