  <title>Fuck Off, Cancer: Breast Cancer Shaken not Stirred - Linda Brossi Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;THE BEST BOOK TO HELP YOU GET FROM HERE TO THERE&amp;nbsp; (it is not as long or scary as you think) FOR LITE TO MEDIUM BREAST CANCER!!! A gem for the patient or their support system! Will tell you what happens behind closed doors!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A breast cancer bestseller!! Must read for all, because let&amp;#39;s face it, the reason we say Fuck Off, Cancer is because it is everywhere and touches every life! Rated Number one on Amazon! Honest! Raw! Warning: This book contains gross pictures and scary middle aged pornography (Don&amp;#39;t say you haven&amp;#39;t been warned!) You will laugh and cry as you learn what happens behind closed doors to your friends or family member with breast cancer. You may think that you are in the know about breast cancer but the truth will shock you! This is not just a book about breast cancer it is a book about life and how breast cancer treatments affect every aspect of it. A quick read with candid, straightforward insight to the real deal of breast cancer! A definite tool for any person wanting to support someone battling breast cancer or for the newly diagnosed patient to see &amp;quot;behind the curtain&amp;quot; In Fuck Off, Cancer: Cancer Shaken Not Stirred on the Rocks, you will learn that fear can be worse than reality when dealing with breast cancer... Read this book and you will realize that early stage (Lite or medium) breast cancer isn&amp;#39;t as bad as you imagine it to be and that you can actually turn this scary diagnosis into a positive! Follow the author&amp;#39;s journey In Fuck Off, Cancer: Cancer Shaken Not Stirred through HER2+ cancer treatments as she turns this deadly disease into a party at every turn. Watch as Linda makes the most of the situation as she weaves her way through various breast cancer treatments. The book covers the topics that are related to the journey of cancer including the occasionally tumultuous marital relations, questioning religion and why breast cancer happened to &amp;quot;me&amp;quot;, how the loss of hair from cancer treatments affected her life, and how relationships with friends and family are altered by this potentially life threatening disease. This book, Fuck Off, Cancer: Cancer Shaken Not Stirred on the Rocks with a Twist, is a very raw, &amp;quot;nothing held back&amp;quot; memoir which lays the facts on the table and contains the pictures to prove it. So grab your libation of choice and sit down for a quick read about making cancer a party!! Book clubs have found this to be a great source for discussion for a myriad of hot topics. Whether you have breast cancer, had breast cancer, know someone with breast cancer or not this book is a great read! The last two pages of the book have discussion questions to get the conversation started! Reading this book will help you, your loved ones and friends realize that breast cancer caught early is usually very treatable and is just a diagnosis not a death sentence! So let&amp;#39;s all say what we want to Fuck Off, Cancer and live life to the fullest! Don&amp;#39;t let breast cancer slow you down! It is just a lump in the road. Warning: This book contains gross pictures and scary middle aged pornography (Don&amp;#39;t say you haven&amp;#39;t been warned!) Linda&amp;#39;s diagnosis was HER2+ Stage 1, Grade 2, ER/PR+ Breast Cancer (according to my husband because I never cared to actually follow along with the gory details) Treatment was 2 lumpectomies, AC, Taxol, Herceptin and a Pertuzumab study, 30 radiation, 3 wigs, lots of fun with family and friends This book, Fuck Off, Cancer: Cancer Shaken Not Stirred on the Rocks with a Twist has very little (actually no) medical jargon and may actually be inaccurate with regards to the medical information it provides... It is about the process of getting through breast cancer with blonde, brunette and redheaded wigs, chemo parties, and much, much more!&lt;/p&gt;" />
