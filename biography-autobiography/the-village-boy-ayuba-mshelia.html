&lt;P align=left&gt;introduction, in the early 20th century, by a group&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align=left&gt;of Kano, Jos, Kaduna ,and, yes, even Lagos. These new immigrants, however,&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;faced steep competition for jobs both from the citys residents and from other&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;migrants who had converged on the cities from all corners of the countryside.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Their meager education forced them into menial jobs, such as house boys or&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;store clerks; few were able to secure even low-level government jobs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The social confl ict and upheaval was partially resolved, to some minimally&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;acceptable levels, by the regular annual visits of those who had left the land,&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;bringing with them gifts of tea, sugar, bread, and items of clothing which were&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;generously and lavishly shared with relatives and neighbours. Some few who&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;had made it, in the city even came with their own mettika (cars).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;But things are not always as gloomy as is refl ected in the lives of Madu, Dalla,&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;and, to some extent, Hassana in the stories that follow. Some of the tribes&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;migrant sons and daughters to the cities (like Madu in the story) took to politics&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;and became active, relevant and prominent during the early years of self-rule&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;and eventual Independence. Education has been, and continues to be, the&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;social instrument of mobility for the children of the migrants and for those who&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;remained on the land, as for example, Dalla. They can now be found in all sectors&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;of the Nigerian society, as educators, business men, politicians and high cadre&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;civil servants.&lt;/P&gt;" />
