  <title>Unlocking a Spiritual Love Within - Rain Basia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a little story of a seven-year journey of faith with the Great I
Am, acknowledging only Him to present you to your real bashert and
what it is to be called upon to achieve greater consciousness. You learn how
to become an understanding and a loving mate, what it is to truly comfort
the one whom you really love. This is what its like when you faithfully
wait and let Gods love rule your life. This is what unconditional devotion
looks like. This is a leap of faith for me. Witness a love that can unlock
racism, segregation, prejudice, etc.
This is who Jesus Christ has called me to be. I am a freedom fighter for
equality of life. This is my mission. He has suffered our pain, and He has
chosen me to pick up my cross for Him in making our world a better place.
Teaching the human race, that God loves all mankind; so we may be seen,
as brothers and sisters, and welcomed as equals, just as Ive pleaded for in
2007. For Dr. Martin Luther Kings, Jr.s Dream; for the Lion of Judea, Jesus
Christs prayer of salvation and love for us all as believers, exclusively as His
children to be unified as one!" />
