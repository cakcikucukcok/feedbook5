  <title>169 Pages of My Life - Taylor Goetz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Taylor, and I wrote this book with the intent that it might help people understand the consequences of doing wrong. Though it may sound that I am glorifying the things I did, if I had the chance to change my life I would have. Though I love where my life is today, there were times I wished I weren&#39;t alive. It took a lot more then what can be imagined to get over the life style I was living. I am proof that a bad kid can turn them selves around. If you think that in the end of this book that I haven&#39;t, then you are wrong and can look forward to reading my next book. The most important thing I was trying to get across is that every little thing in life including people can be very deceiving and to stick only to what you believe in and nothing else. In the end nothing and I mean nothing will matter except that your heart be in the right place." />
