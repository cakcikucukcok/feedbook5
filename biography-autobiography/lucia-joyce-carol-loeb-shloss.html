  <title>Lucia Joyce - Carol Loeb Shloss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Whatever spark or gift I possess has been transmitted to Lucia and it has kindled a fire in her brain.&quot; --James Joyce, 1934&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most accounts of James Joyce&#39;s family portray Lucia Joyce as the mad daughter of a man of genius, a difficult burden. But in this important new book, Carol Loeb Shloss reveals a different, more dramatic truth: her father loved Lucia, and they shared a deep creative bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucia was born in a pauper&#39;s hospital and educated haphazardly across Europe as her penniless father pursued his art. She wanted to strike out on her own and in her twenties emerged, to Joyce&#39;s amazement, as a harbinger of expressive modern dance in Paris. He described her then as a wild, beautiful, &quot;fantastic being&quot; whose mind was &quot;as clear and as unsparing as the lightning.&quot; The family&#39;s only reader of Joyce, she was a child of the imaginative realms her father created, and even after emotional turmoil wrought havoc with her and she was hospitalized in the 1930s, he saw in her a life lived in tandem with his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though most of the documents about Lucia have been destroyed, Shloss painstakingly reconstructs the poignant complexities of her life--and with them a vital episode in the early history of psychiatry, for in Joyce&#39;s efforts to help her he sought the help of Europe&#39;s most advanced doctors, including Jung. In Lucia&#39;s world Shloss has also uncovered important material that deepens our understanding of &lt;i&gt;Finnegans Wake&lt;/i&gt;, the book that redefined modern literature.&lt;/p&gt;" />
