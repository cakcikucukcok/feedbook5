  <title>Visions of a Sacred Truth - L.B. Owens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I closed my eyes as I fell straight down not wishing to see as I crashed among the rocks. I felt my body crush, every bone, as I hit the hard surface of the flat rocks. An excruciating pain electrified my body but only for a moment and then no pain at all; nothing, only darkness.
