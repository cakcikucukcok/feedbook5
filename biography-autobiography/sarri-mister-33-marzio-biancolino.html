  <title>Sarri - Mister 33 - Marzio Biancolino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saggi&lt;/b&gt; - Essay (48 pagine) - From bank manager, working in some of Europe’s most prestigious financial centres, to coach of SSC Napoli, in pursuit of Maradona’s glory days; a veritable springboard to the amazing Premier League arena at the helm of Chelsea Football Club. That, in a nutshell, is Maurizio Sarri’s unique career path. This is a multi-faceted look at a life full of humanity, fun facts and surprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the time I chose a job which was the only one I would have done for free. I have been a player and coach for absolutely ages. I didn’t just stumble into this profession. Some people still call me ‘the former office worker’, as if it were some sort of crime to have had another type of job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what Maurizio Sarri has to say about himself, looking back on a unique career path that took him from some of the most prestigious financial centres in Europe to the Chelsea FC bench, following a glorious 3 years at SSC Napoli. It is quite unusual to put in your first appearance in ‘Serie A’ at the ripe old age of 55, and within just a year find yourself on the SSC Napoli bench without a footballing career behind you like that of Guardiola, Mancini, Ancelotti or Zidane, but more akin to Mourinho or Sacchi, a comparision which incidentally does not displease Sarri. Add that to finding yourself having to recreate a dream which is almost an imperative: to revive the times of Diego Armando Maradona’s epic heyday. All of this without even remotely imagining that, after a glorious three years under mount Vesuvius, the future would have taken him not only to the UK , but to lead Chelsea F.C. no less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marzio Biancolino&lt;/b&gt; is an author and journalist who has enjoyed success writing for a number of major Italian newspapers, among which “La Repubblica” – (“Satyricon”) and “La Gazzetta dello Sport”. He also had his own daily column in the latter during the 1990 Italian World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the same author writing as Marco Stretto: “Siamo tutti tifosi della Juventus” &lt;i&gt;(“We are all Juventus fans”);&lt;/i&gt; “Siamo tutti tifosi dell’Inter” &lt;i&gt;(“We are all Inter fans”);&lt;/i&gt; “Siamo tutti tifosi del Milan” &lt;i&gt;(“We are all Milan fans”);&lt;/i&gt; “Siamo tutti tifosi del Napoli” &lt;i&gt;(“We are all Napoli fans”);&lt;/i&gt; “Siamo tutti tifosi della Roma” &lt;i&gt;(“We are all Roma fans”)&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
