  <title>The Opportunity Bus - Ennio Vita-Finzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tired of your career? Maybe it&#39;s time to switch directions. If you&#39;re open to change and willing to do some exploring, then you need to take advantage of &lt;I&gt;The Opportunity Bus&lt;/I&gt;. The bus operates continuously, providing transportation to new experiences and adventures-&lt;I&gt;if&lt;/I&gt; you step on board when it stops.&lt;/p&gt;
Following his own philosophy, Ennio Vita-Finzi describes the opportunities he seized through his optimistic jaunt through life. Known as a &quot;human energy source with no reverse gear,&quot; Vita-Finzi seizes the most out of a life that has taken him around the world. He&#39;s had careers in air transportation, banking, and the service sector, was a trade commissioner in Western Europe, South America, and the United States, and managed four companies in Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
In addition to creating two consulting companies in Canada, Vita-Finzi has also been an actor, travel agent, cartoonist, headhunter, martial artist, and telemarketer. Add to his list university lecturer, musician, street vendor, public speaker, tour guide, antique dealer, and a college and university teacher, and you&#39;ll see that Vita-Finzi is living proof of how you, too, can create a life bursting with possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
