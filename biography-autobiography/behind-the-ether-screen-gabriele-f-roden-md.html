  <title>Behind the Ether Screen - Gabriele F. Roden, Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The surgeons&#39; heads seemed small next to the huge dome-shaped lights. Together heads and lights zoomed in on this sick heart, which looked like a wiggly red ball of flesh.  Gloved fingers felt and searched for new possibilities.&lt;p&gt;
All of a sudden there was an undeniable knowing that someday I would be a member of such a team and stand at the head of the patient to guard his or her life&lt;p&gt;
Bold and brilliant, &lt;i&gt;Behind the Ether Screen&lt;/i&gt; shares the true story of Gabriele F. Roden, a woman whose attempt to break free from a childhood of relentless expectations of performance and perfection, instead ended up choosing a career with similar challenges that resulted in great successes.&lt;p&gt;
Born in post-war Germany, Roden was raised with rigorous discipline and motivation to choose a career based on humanitarian principles that would outlast the demolished, chaotic surroundings of her home. But it was a pivotal move to Ireland in her teens and her enrollment at University College Cork that launched her career in medicine.&lt;p&gt;
Her early drive to excel in the specialty of anesthesiology brought her to the United States of America as a young graduate. She completed her internship in Worcester, MA, pursued her anesthesia residency at Yale University, and after a few years in private practice at a community hospital, she returned to academic medicine in Boston.&lt;p&gt; 
Spanning a career of more than thirty-seven years, Dr. Rodens moving account offers insight into the behind-the-scenes struggles and rewards of her specialty." />
