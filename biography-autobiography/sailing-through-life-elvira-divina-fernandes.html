  <title>Sailing Through Life - Elvira Divina Fernandes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Elvira Divina Fernandes is a true citizen of  Earth. She was born in Brazil, studied in Autralia, and lived in Argentina before deciding that she wanted to return down under to make her home in Australia. She has boldly faced lifes challenges, including the adventure of moving to places where she knew nothing of the language or culture. But no matter where she was on the planet, she was also on another journey, taking her to a more profound and intimate relationship with her God, her faith, and her sexuality.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Elvira lived what many would consider to be an ordinary life. As a housewife and mother, she dared to challenge cultural bias and her own self-judgment to explore her belief that spirituality and sensuality can quite harmoniously inspire both the life and the body of a person of true faith. She found the courage and discipline to pursue and achieve her corporeal and celestial goals.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In her memoir, she proves that life really begins at fiftywhen you have the right attitude and a healthy dose of self-confi dence and self love. Sailing through Life: My Life with God, Spirituality, and Sexuality is an inspirational literary adventure for women of all ages who are eager to explore every aspect of the miracle of life, love, and devotion.&lt;/P&gt;" />
