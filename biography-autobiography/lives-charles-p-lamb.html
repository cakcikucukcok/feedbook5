  <title>Lives - Charles P. Lamb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lives - is a collection of short stories, memoirs, poems and essays by members of the Soundwriters.  Most of the authors in this book were part of the &quot;Lost Generation&quot; that grew up sandwiched between World War II and Viet Nam.  With one exception none were the glamorized heroes or heroines, the warriors and production workers of the Greatest Generation. 
In fact most were still growing up when the bomb was dropped at Hiroshima.  But they remember family characters, trials and tribulations of youth, coming of age, winning and losing, the poverty during the great depression, the struggles of families to escape persecution, blackouts and rationing, the atomic age, a forgotten war in Korea and the continuing struggle.  More importantly perhaps, they recognize the joys and sorrows of living, the impact of key decisions, dealing with the health and death of a loved one and the dynamics and satisfaction of aging.
Each has had a career, raised a family and faced adversity.  All have been moved by their passions and emotions.  Some looked to their heritage for strength or inspiration, others became spiritual.  All have continued to absorb a world of changes and challenges...most recently computer literacy and line dancing.
They are from a wide range of backgrounds: from a Cuban emigrant to a Son of the Revolution, from a daughter of the Nebraska plains to a Hungarian Jew from the Bronx.  Among the eight are a Roman Catholic, conservative and secular Jews, a humanist and a member of the Friends Society.  Their lives have been tempered by the holocaust, the devastation of alcoholic relatives, divorce, war, nature, family disputes, self doubt, prejudice and sometimes unrequited love; and strengthened by the simple joys of accomplishment and growth, a sincere belief in God, love, romance and just being here.  Each has written about a unique set of experiences.  Their stories reveal a sensitive appreciation for life, warts and all.
Some of the work is remembered history, some fictitious memoirs, some fiction and the rest essays on life.  But it is the voice of the author, the storyteller and the visions conjured up that will make the reader laugh or cry, truly believe the work or find it incredulous.  Those who keep in mind that each story started with a memory will find much to reflect upon.
Excerpts from the stories:
&quot;We all went to bed exhausted, but were soon awakened by the sound of shouting and noises in the street.  We ran to the window and looked out.  We couldnt believe what we saw and heard.  Groups of men, some carrying torches, were hurling bricks and rocks at the windows of stores owned by Jews.  Shattered glass was everywhere, and beyond the buildings on our street, fires lighted up the sky.  We looked at one another in unbelievable fright.  We wondered, would we ever get out of Fuerth.  What would our life be like from now on?  We held one another and prayed to God to protect us.&quot;  An Unforgettable Night....Helen Wallerstein.
&quot;She clutched at my face raking my cheek with a nail.  There was a silent second before she stepped back, dropped her head, mumbled an apology and turned away.  I stood there dumbfounded.... A plane was missing over the Sea of Japan.... There was no word on survivors. Nothing I could say would make any difference.  Suddenly I felt overwhelmed.  The trembling urgent grip that shook me to a standstill, the image of her face burned into my memory.  More importantly, I knew I had blown it completely.  At Kimpo Air Force Base I had steeled myself in a priestly ritual before confronting the body bags and the pale faces of wounded marines.  But hours of training and enforced self-discipline had not prepared me to react to random raw reality.&quot;  Earned Leave.... Charles P. Lamb.
&quot;Her death represented the end of an era almost.  Now only one member of the 20 Knerl-Hunsberger siblings remained: Uncle Victor, the youngest of Mothers siblings. His death in 1998 closed a chapter of our f" />
