  <title>I Wrote You a Song - Guy Simons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Wrote You A Song&lt;/i&gt; is a book that has been constructed like an album with twelve original songs written by Guy Simons that provides a sub-text for lifes journey. The author discusses the underlying theme of each song from a social context using autobiographical reflections, social observations and philosophical musings, intermingled with a large dose of satirical commentary, quirkiness and humour. The author invites readers to be inspired to find their true place in this world through twelve songs that take them on a journey of self-discovery and personal recollection.
&lt;p&gt;Covering topics of life, death, love, hate, joy, despair, health, sickness, hopes, fears, wealth and poverty, immerse yourself in an album unlike any other. Recall your own experiences within each song and reconnect to your past through subject headings that are actual popular song titles. Whether that is the Start or The End you are sure to find an affinity with the subject headings, and if youre looking for Good Vibrations or the Art of Dying you will find it here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prelude provides the insight prior to embarking on the journey through songs as diverse as The New Elvis Presley, You Say Youre Leaving to Another Bad Day at the Office and Cyber Spaceman culminating in the curtain raiser I Wrote You a Song. A coda followed by the encore brings the work to a close giving you a chance to confirm whether your soundtrack to this book mirrored the authors, or whether you would have chosen alternate subject headings to align to your own personal experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a songwriter and he has written you a song. &lt;/p&gt;" />
