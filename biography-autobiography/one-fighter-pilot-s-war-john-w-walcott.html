  <title>One Fighter Pilot’S War - John W. Walcott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author John W. Walcott was a citizen soldier who went through rigorous training in order to escort bombers in a P-51 Mustang fighter during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;I&gt;One Fighter Pilots War&lt;/I&gt;, he recalls that journey in vivid detail, offering an insiders view of the military system of the time, painting a fascinating portrait of his colorful fellow cadets and the skilled instructors who delivered highly trained pilots to the theater of war. He remembers climbing into the cockpits of the Army Air Corps trainers, confronting German jets, strafing Nazi convoys and rail lines, flying escort missions with observation aircrafts and bombers alike, and working to save the crews of disabled aircraft. He also recounts the dangerous rescue of downed pilots in the mountainous Balkans. His is the story not of an ace but of one of the dedicated men and women who served every day in the war to do their part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This memoir tells the personal story of a World War II fighter pilot, bringing to life for all generations those years of sacrifice and achievement.&lt;/p&gt;" />
