  <title>Baltic Winds: Testimony of a Soviet Attorney - Simona Pipko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Baltic Winds, a nonfiction work, tells a life story of the prominent Soviet defense attorney, her family, friends, and clients.  The narrative covers the period from the 1950s through the 90s and reflects lives of the characters on two continents, from Leningrad through Tallinn, Rome, and finally New York.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the book, Mothers and Children, presents life in Russia.  It provides first-hand observation about people from different ethnic groups and reveals the abominable conditions they live in, the struggles women encounter in every day life, their status as second-class citizens, their numerous abortions, domestic violence, and sexual abuse.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the book, Years, People, Countries, takes the reader, along with the author through Europe to America.  It shows how immigration and a teaching position in two universities again have brought the author close to peoplethis time Americans.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Baltic Winds is a heartfelt contribution of first-hand experience and information, which
brings to light the as-yet uncovered truth. &lt;/p&gt;" />
