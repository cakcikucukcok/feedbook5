In the local city leagues, where he was omnipresent, he truly shined. He cosistently scored high, was a positive team player, and is fondly remembered by many from that time for generously sharing his acumen for the game.

However, he went into the army instead. There he developed into quite a boxer. His development was cut short by a tragic car wreck, in which he almost lost a leg. &lt;st1:City w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Walker&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; fought back, and became a wheelchair champ.
