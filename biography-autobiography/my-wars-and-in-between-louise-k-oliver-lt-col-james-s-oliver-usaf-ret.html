      <meta name="description" content="James S. Oliver grew up on the southern Philippine Island of Mindanaohiding from World War II aggressors with his Filipino mother and three siblings. 
He did not know it then, but war would become a constant in his life, even after he moved to the United States. Hed graduate from college and become an officer in the US Air Force, where hed spend the next twenty-four years.
During the Cold War with Soviet Russia, he specialized in intercontinental ballistic missile operations and maintenance, and was selected for Special Forces training at Fort Bragg. 
Then he joined a controversial, top secret Provincial Advisory Group Team for one year, operating out of Bao Trai, Hau Nghia, a former province in South Vietnam, where an all-new war was underway. Hed retire in 1984 as commander of the Ninetieth Organizational Missile Maintenance Squadron (90 OMMS), an ICBM maintenance squadron of the Strategic Air Command.
Despite numerous challenges, the author maintained his faith in humanity, and youll be inspired by the years of devoted service he highlights in My Wars and In Between." />
