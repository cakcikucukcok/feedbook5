  <title>Part Ii Managing for Success: House-Broken, Not House-Tamed - Vincent Edward Gooden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this sequel to Interaction Our Way...A Portrait of Success, Vince revisits and relives events in his life from toddler to adulthood that contribute to his management approach and leadership qualities. He presents management as a wholeness approach inclusive of planning, approach (action), staffing, organization and budget (PASOB). This context incorporates how we act, interact, manage and lead in our daily lives and embodies the rightness of self and how we make right for others. Vince recognizes that all leaders are not managers; however managers should embrace leadership qualities such as strategic planning, integrity, motivation, and commitment to the management process as well as to the customer. Rightness in this context is (1) compliance with the natural laws of good versus evil and right versus wrong as well as (2) demonstration of a common sense approach to management and leadership. The Gooden siblings believe in the rightness of self and others and exhibit this in their management and leadership efforts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
