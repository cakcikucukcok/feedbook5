  <title>Living in Interesting Times - Morris Herman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book describes the personal journey of Morris Herman. His parents were Holocaust survivors who were incarcerated in a Ukraine concentration camp from 1941 to 1944. Morris Herman was born in Romania in 1946 when it was ruled by a Communist dictator. His mother shared with Morris stories about life in concentration camp where she barely survived.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book describes family life and the start of his education under a communist dictatorship.&amp;nbsp; Thirteen years later, the family moved to Israel which was only ten years old. He was sent to a children&amp;rsquo;s kibbutz for about a year and a half where he learned to be independent and collaborate to attain a common goal. He milked cows and handled vegetable field irrigation tasks while also going to school.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family received an immigrant visa to come to New York when he was fourteen yrs old. The book describes his education starting with not knowing any English and ending with his rise to the top of the class. The book describes his continued education at Christopher Columbus High School in NYC and then at the City College of New York. He received a B.S. degree in Mathematics and after graduation joined Raytheon company where he remained for 47 and a half years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book describes his very successful career in the defense electronics company and his rise to a high technical rank. The book describes the interesting and challenging projects that Morris Herman worked on. His work in Massachusetts involved the development of the Patriot anti-aircraft missile. When he moved to California, his work involved designing aircraft systems to protect our military aircraft pilots that flew into harm&amp;rsquo;s way.&amp;nbsp; These systems made it possible for pilots to come home safe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now retired, the book describes his continued American Dream life which he wants to share with his readers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
