  <title>More Gold - Richard V. Shriver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="More Gold is the continuation of stories begun in my earlier book, Gold to Refine. I believe we all need stories  funny stories, touching stories, loving stories, happy stories, stories with a moral, stories with hope. In this collection, I return to events of my childhood and youth with my brothers. The stories are about growing up in Nashville, Tennessee in very wonderful times, and include tales about my mother, father, grandparents, and friends.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 There are stories about our rattletrap cars  and they make us wonder how we survived to adulthood. There are stories about the church and my co-workers in the church; and about teaching at the university. There are stories about my son and daughter to whom the book is dedicated.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 I hope that the collection continues to offer humor, healing, faith, and encouragement at a time in our history when these qualities are so desperately needed." />
