  <title>Survival Within Two Cultures - Erminia &quot;Minnie&quot; Lopez Rincon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When &lt;b&gt;Erminia Minnie Lopez Rincon&lt;/b&gt; was born, she was not breathing, but the attendant working on her tiny body did not give up until Rincon was breathing on her own. So began the life of a Mexican American woman who would not only endure many unforeseen challenges and emotional struggles, but would also eventually rise above it all to find her passion and true calling in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her compelling memoir, Rincon eloquently details her struggles to rise above her humble beginnings living in a railroad camp outside of Chicago, Illinois, with her family of nine. She shares how she coped with lifes unforeseen changes by burying her feelings, reading, and doing well in school. Rincon chronicles a difficult childhood only made more challenging by discrimination, the death of her mother, and betrayal by those she trusted. Despite all her obstacles, Rincon matures into adulthood and manages to lead a fairly normal lifeuntil her past finally catches up to her. It is only through therapy that Rincon finally begins to reconcile with her past and realize a long-held, burning desire.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Survival within Two Cultures&lt;/i&gt; is the story of one womans determination to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges in order to make her dreams come true.&lt;p&gt;" />
