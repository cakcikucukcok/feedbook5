In Merry Mariner, Girisam narrates a host of real-life adventures, near-miss incidents, and heart-stopping experiences. He tells about the time a ship was cruising in the Suez Canal and the steering failed, when the engine room flooded with sea water on a ship loaded with 250,000 tons of iron ore, and when a fully loaded ship ran aground and jagged rocks ripped open the ships plate. 
In addition, Girisam relates memorable, and hilarious events from his college days, his fun filled days as a junior engineer on his first ship, and many rib ticking stories (The Reluctant Cupid, My daughters musical adventures etc) about his family and friends. Merry Mariner also offers a collection of his thoughts and opinions on a variety of topics in a lighter vein (Hammer Masters club, Amnesia, boon or bane? Etc)" />
