  <title>Tangents Between God - Regan Vasconcellos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to a promising work of modern literature that is filled from beginning to end with an exceedingly rich tapestry of experiences. Regan&#39;s writing is mindful, deep and interactive, and he tells his unusual life stories with an eager vivacity and exuberance that keeps his readers constantly wide eyed in shock, nodding in agreement, and laughing out loud.  Tangents is an X-ray vision of his patchy relationship with God and his prodigal romantic encounters that often carry him dim witted to his knees, or to the precipice of suicide and existential despair. He explores each with humor, unapologetic candor, and a poetic precision that jolts readers to an awakening, and a recognition of the social and spiritual truth that is hardly addressed in the forefronts of life.  &quot;I don&#39;t think about art while I work, I try to think about life.&quot;  - Jean Michel Basquiat  Cover Art by Regan Vasconcellos" />
