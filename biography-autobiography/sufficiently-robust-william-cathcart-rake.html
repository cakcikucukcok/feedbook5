  <title>Sufficiently Robust - William Cathcart-Rake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William Cathcart-Rake shares his memories
of a half-century of hiking in the Grand Canyon. During that time he spent sixty days and walked five hundred miles below the rim. As he recounts his thoughts and experiences of eighteen separate treks below the rim, he includes many fascinating facts about the Canyons natural and human history. As the years go by, the author discovers that the
Canyon has more to offer than just being a challenging place to hikeit becomes a
sanctuary for reflection and renewal.&lt;p&gt;
His time in the canyon is more than days below the rim, miles walked, switchbacks
negotiated, stream crossings, walking speed, and pounds carried. Conquering the canyonan impossible and foolish questceased to be a goal. He returned to the canyon because of the effect it had on him, not because of what he could do in it or to it. The canyon allowed him to discover his ability to persevere despite
discomfort, afforded an opportunity to learn more about the natural world we live in, and gave him a deeper appreciation of the need to seek the solace afforded by sauntering below the rim." />
