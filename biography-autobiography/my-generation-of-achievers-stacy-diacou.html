  <title>My Generation of Achievers - Stacy Diacou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Greeks in America during the latter half of the twentieth century had a mission to establish themselves as valuable contributors to society. Hundreds of them achieved success, building businesses, communities, and relationships that still stand today. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Journalist Stacy Diacou documented their achievements in her social columns for Chicagos Greek Press newspaper, and My Generation of Achievers is a compilation of her writings. Beginning in 1969, Diacou showed how these brave souls left their homeland and jumped over the hurdles of language barriers, joblessness, and empty pockets to create a better world for their children in the United States of America.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Diacou profiles specific, treasured individuals in Chicago and reveals how they moved through society with grace and perseverance. Her columns document the fashion of the time, social gatherings, and the inner workings of Chicagos Greek American community up until 1996. From luncheons and history lectures to celebrity sightings and church youth groups, Diacou captures a snapshot in time of one of Americas most successful immigrant groups.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Fun, insightful, and entertaining, My Generation of Achievers opens the door to a fascinating aspect of Greek-American history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
