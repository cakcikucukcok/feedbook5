  <title>Hope on a Strange Planet - Chaplain Stephen Dicks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wished you could understand that soldier you know and love better? Or perhaps youre a soldier yourself who feels as if no one really understands what youve been through.&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Hope on a Strange Planet&lt;/i&gt;, author Chaplain Stephen Dicks seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the experiences of an American in the military by sharing this personal narrative. He came up through the ranks in the US Army from a private to an officer, with two long tours in Iraq. From Baghdad and Mosul, attached to a combat support hospital during some of the hardest fighting, to his final tour with the Fortieth MPs out of Fort Leavenworth and the 2011 withdrawal of US troops, Chaplain Dicks offers insight into the life and thoughts of a US soldier deployed to a strange planet in the middle of a combat zone. He gives hope to those who have been there that they can survive.&lt;p&gt;
In this memoir, an army chaplain presents his life story with humor, pride, and sorrow, along with a firsthand understanding of the sacrifices the soldiers and their families make each day.&lt;p&gt;" />
