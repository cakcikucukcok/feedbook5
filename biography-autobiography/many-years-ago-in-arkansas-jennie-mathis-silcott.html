  <title>Many Years Ago in Arkansas - Jennie Mathis Silcott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the lives and times of a real familynot only the struggles and the unbelievable heartaches and disappointments in our lives, but also how the Lord worked in our lives in the midst of it all.  It is with godly fear and much humility that I undertake the task of writing this book as I am in no sense of the word a writer.  My purpose in writing this book is to help and give courage to someone that may think his or her situation hopeless.  My prayer is that God may make this book a blessing to many.
Our mother was born Ida Louise Durham, on October 28, 1921, the third living child of Mrs. Bertha McQuire Durham and Mr. Jeff Durham, in Marianna, Arkansas. She attended school in Arkansas. She lost her father at the age of seven years. Life began to be difficult from that day on. It is unbelievable the hardships this lady went through, but she was a fighter from her heart.  She never let the disappointments in her life get her down. She always told us, When life knocks you down, dont lay there, get yourself up. Tomorrow is another day.  She truly was an example to us, her children, and to many people who came her way during her seventy-seven years of life." />
