  <title>Confessions of a Guide Dog - Musket, Mark Carlson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;Have you ever wondered what a guide dog does? &lt;br&gt;
How do they know to lead a blind owner? &lt;br&gt;
Can they understand traffic lights? &lt;br&gt;
Most importantly, how does the owner know where to pick up the poop?&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This memoir answers these questionsand more. It tells what guide dogs are supposed to do. Theyre smart, loyal and well-trainedbut not all dogs are created alike. Musket is proof of that. Hes definitely got a thing for treats and belly rubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, the dog has his say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Of course he needed a little help with the typing, since he doesnt have opposable thumbs. Thats where author Mark Carlson came in. Still, Musket is the brains of the outfit.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark and Musket tell their story with humor, emotion, and Muskets occasional contradictions. And at the end of the day, Musket somehow manages to be a great guide dog too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Confessions of a Guide Dog&lt;/i&gt; was written so a wonderful, devoted dog could reach out to those who havent been lucky enough to meet him. Hell make you smile, laugh, cry, and want to give him treats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(And theyre sticking to it.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
