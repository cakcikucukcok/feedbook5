  <title>The Dead Janitors Club - Jeff Klima</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It had been well over a month since I had seen or heard from Dirk, and it was showing in my bank account...I was tempted to start searching for another job. I still had faith, though, that somehow, someway, I was meant for this line of work...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hello?&quot; I mumbled, not recognizing the number on the caller ID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jeff, it&#39;s Dirk,&quot; said the voice. I waited curiously, wondering who the hell Dirk was. &quot;We&#39;ve got one,&quot; he eventually said when I failed to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had never bothered to get together for any sort of training, and now, it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After toiling for minimum wage for years, Jeff Klima got an unexpected offer: to head up a brand new crime scene cleanup company in Orange County. The upside? A chance to make incredible money in a field with no competition. The downside? Everything else about the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dead Janitors Club &lt;/i&gt;is an engrossing, hilarious, and morbidly fascinating memoir of life and death, from someone whose life &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;death. From his first job-where a piece of brain fell off the ceiling and landed in his eye-to having to clean up one of his former neighbors, &lt;i&gt;The Dead Janitors Club &lt;/i&gt;is more than just a retelling of crime scenes and what it takes to clean them up. It is a memoir about struggling to survive college, love, life, and keeping one&#39;s sanity when one never knows if, the next time the phone rings, you must delve into the darker side of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
