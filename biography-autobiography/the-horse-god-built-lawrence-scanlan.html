  <title>The Horse God Built - Lawrence Scanlan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He was the perfect horse, it was said, &quot;the horse God built.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us know the legend of Secretariat, the tall, handsome chestnut racehorse whose string of honors runs long and rich: the only two-year-old ever to win Horse of the Year, in 1972; winner in 1973 of the Triple Crown, his times in all three races still unsurpassed; featured on the cover of&lt;i&gt; Time, Newsweek,&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; Sports Illustrated;&lt;/i&gt; the only horse listed on ESPN&#39;s top fifty athletes of the twentieth century (ahead of Mickey Mantle). His final race at Toronto&#39;s Woodbine Racetrack is a touchstone memory for horse lovers everywhere. Yet while Secretariat will be remembered forever, one man, Eddie &quot;Shorty&quot; Sweat, who was pivotal to the great horse&#39;s success, has been all but forgotten---until now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&lt;i&gt; The Horse God Built,&lt;/i&gt; bestselling equestrian writer Lawrence Scanlan has written a tribute to an exceptional man that is also a backroads journey to a corner of the racing world rarely visited. As a young black man growing up in South Carolina, Eddie Sweat struggled at several occupations before settling on the job he was born for---groom to North America&#39;s finest racehorses. As Secretariat&#39;s groom, loyal friend, and protector, Eddie understood the horse far better than anyone else. A wildly generous man who could read a horse with his eyes, he shared in little of the financial success or glamour of Secretariat&#39;s wins on the track, but won the heart of Big Red with his soft words and relentless devotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Scanlan&#39;s rich narrative, we get a groom&#39;s-eye view of the racing world and the vantage of a man who spent every possible moment with the horse he loved, yet who often basked in the horse&#39;s glory from the sidelines. More than anything else,&lt;i&gt; The Horse God Built &lt;/i&gt;is a moving portrait of the powerful bond between human and horse.&lt;/p&gt;" />
