  <title>The Most Awesome Years Ever - Lelani Sade Ellis, Arthur Ellis PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Im one of the most popular girls in my class. I was born on October 15, 2003, in Charleston, South Carolina. This book is written to help young writers like myself in the twenty-first century. Therere many reasons to write this book; primarily, I used it as a tool to pass the time while waiting for mom to pick me up from the Boys and Girls Club, where kids go when their parents work the late hours. I know Moms work is very important; other moms think so. Shes the manager of Annas Linen Store. I know mom enjoys her job; I would if I were older.
This book is very comprehensive, I think, and addresses most of my life. Each part will connect with my family and my best friends around the world. Most of all, it places special emphasis on how hard it was to write it.
You know, I estimated that there are over 200 members in my family. I dont know each of them, but when I complete this book, I hope to be able to call each by their correct name. Also, I hope to be able to ask them many questions about the role that they play in my life, at our upcoming Thanksgiving dinner, which will be at my sweet Uncle Elliss house." />
