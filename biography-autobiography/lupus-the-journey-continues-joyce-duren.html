  <title>Lupus . . . the Journey Continues - Joyce Duren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joyce Duren establishes herself as a force to be reckoned with in literary as well as other circles.
Ms. Duren has written a work of commendable perfection. In style, content, and supreme organization, My Bout with Lupus now takes its place on the universal bookshelf of masterpieces.
There can be no doubt about her originality. She tells an unusually touching story in a colorful, lighthearted language unique to a contemporary Californian with roots in Cleveland, Ohio, and West Virginia, all of which she is . . . and has . . . None of which she denies.
She also can take on tough situations successfully. Her completion of this fine book, despite overwhelming odds, proves that. And her application of spiritual tools such as prayer, fasting, and positive thinking along the way proves her to be steadfast in her faith.
Besides being entertaining and inspiring My Bout with Lupus is also educational. It teaches us how to apply our own inner resources in these tumultuous times. Thus, Ms. Duren is a master teacher too.
On top of all this, shes also charismatic, perfect for any television talk show. Hints of her healthy personality leak out of this vigorous saga about her struggles successfully to meet the challenges of simultaneously being a single parent, church activist, and businessperson.
Writer, instructor, personalityJoyce Duren is all these great things . . . and more. But why go on here?
Read her inspiring, informative story." />
