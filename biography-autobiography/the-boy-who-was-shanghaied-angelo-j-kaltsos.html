  <title>The Boy Who Was Shanghaied - Angelo J. Kaltsos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Raised by his father during the depression, author Angelo J. Kaltsos chronicles memories from his childhood through his adult years of traveling and work in &lt;i&gt;The Boy Who Was Shanghaied&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt; 
After his mother left the family when he was just eighteen months old, he and his older sister were raised by their father. Later, they were the subjects of a custody battle when their fathers ability to take care of them adequately was challenged by child services and he lost the court case. The children spent a year in an institution, a foster home, and then returned to their father, ultimately running away at the ages of fourteen (Angelo) and sixteen (his sister) to find a better life.&lt;p&gt;
In a series of short stories, he talks about the jobs he held prior and post WW II, then his travels after his army tour.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Boy Who Was Shanghaied&lt;/i&gt; is the true story of a young man who fought against very tough odds to build a successful life as an educator and researcher.&lt;p&gt;" />
