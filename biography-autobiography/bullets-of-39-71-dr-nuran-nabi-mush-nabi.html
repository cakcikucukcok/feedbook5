  <title>Bullets of &#39;71 - Dr. Nuran Nabi, Mush Nabi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;U&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Bullets of &lt;/U&gt;`&lt;U&gt;71: A Freedom Fighter&#39;s Story&lt;/U&gt; details Dr. Nuran Nabi&#39;s experience growing up in rural Bangladesh and living through the tumultuous episodes of the Bangladesh liberation movement and the liberation war. This is the true story of how a frail young man developed into a politically conscious student activist before transforming into a heroic freedom fighter in the Bangladesh Liberation War. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Throughout Dr. Nabi&#39;s narrative, the untold stories of the Bangladesh Liberation War unfold. The sacrifices and heroic actions captured through Dr. Nabi&#39;s words define more than his accomplishments, they define his entire generation. The Bangladesh Liberation War was a people&#39;s war. Men and women, young and old, students, farmers, bureaucrats, laborers, political activists, and defected Bengali soldiers of the Pakistani military, all joined the liberation war. &lt;U&gt;Bullets of &lt;/U&gt;`&lt;U&gt;71&lt;/U&gt; is their story.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Bangladesh liberation war was bloody. Three million people were killed, thousands of women were raped, and ten million people were forced to become refugees. However, this story transcends the events of the war. It explores the political backdrop amongst China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and India. Dr. Nabi effectively illustrates how the selfish decisions of a few world leaders led to millions of crimes perpetrated against humanity.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But among all the pages in this book none are more candid and horrific than those that cover the atrocities committed by the Pakistani military. Although the Bangladesh genocide unfolded during the nine months of the liberation war, Dr. Nabi thoughtfully separates these stories to remind us of why he and his fellow freedom fighters fought. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;U&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Bullets of &lt;/U&gt;`&lt;U&gt;71: A Freedom Fighter&#39;s Story&lt;/U&gt; is the most authentic account of the events that transpired in 1971 Bangladesh. It is a captivating story that captures the elements of the universal struggle for freedom. &lt;/P&gt;" />
