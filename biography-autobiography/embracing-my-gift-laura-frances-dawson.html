  <title>Embracing My Gift - Laura Frances Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Psychic medium Frances Camilleri was born with a special gift that allows her to see and communicate with spirits everywhere. As a child, this ability confused her; she couldnt understand why no one else could see her special spirit friends. Now she helps others come to terms with their grief by connecting them with lost loved ones. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But as she grew, so did her understanding of what her gift meantand how she could use it to help others. Now, for the first time, she tells the incredible story of her life. Coming to terms with the powers she possessed and how to use them responsibly was a challenge but one she has mastered. For a young girl with these gifts, school days were sometimes a nightmare, but she found a way to learn from these lessons. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When her family moved into what they thought would be a safe haven, she soon realized that the home was haunted by malevolent spirits who eventually ran the family off. From that experience, Frances learned how to use her abilities to cleanse housesand she now teaches others how to protect their homes and families in this way. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The negative experiences in her life inspired Frances to study parapsychology and spiritual healing methods such as Reiki. By channelling guidance from spirit guides, she is able to give direction to others helping with many of the life issues we all face." />
