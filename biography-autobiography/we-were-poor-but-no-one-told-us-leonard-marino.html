  <title>We Were Poor but No One Told Us - Leonard Marino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WE WERE POOR BUT NO ONE TOLD US is the true story of a child of a family of 10, born and raised in the slums of Buffalo, New York, who overcame the obstacles of poverty. The story begins with my parents, Joseph and Rose, two immigrants from Italy. Pa was a decorated hero of the Italian navy and with the meager reward money from King Umberto of Italy, immigrated to the United States, where he met and married Mom in 1913. They raised 10 chilren over a time span over 31 years, through 2 World Wars, the Great Depression and many years of poverty....covering the period between 1913 and 1945. During this period, the only affordable living facility in Buffalo, New York, was on Dante Place, a slum area, adjacent to the abandoned and historic Erie Canal. During the summer months, those old enough, along with Mom, worked on nearby Buffalo farms picking fruit and vegetables. The proceeds from this yearly summer endeavor carried the family through the winter months. Pa worked as a laborer on the Lehigh Valley railroad for 7 days a week until he retired in 1978. Despite many personal trials and near catastrophic events over the years, the family emerged stronger." />
