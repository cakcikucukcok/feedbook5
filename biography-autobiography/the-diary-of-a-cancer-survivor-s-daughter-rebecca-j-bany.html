  <title>The Diary of a Cancer Survivorýs Daughter - Rebecca J. Bany</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;On Sunday she went to my niece&#39;s seventeenth birthday party. It hasn&#39;t even been a week since the surgery. She didn&#39;t act any different. If you didn&#39;t know, you couldn&#39;t tell she had just had a mastectomy surgery. I hope that I have at least half of the strength and courage she has. It boggles my mind how she is always so strong and happy. Through this whole process she didn&#39;t let it get her down.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
The day author Rebecca Bany discovered her mother suffered from breast cancer, she wasn&#39;t sure how she would handle the experience. Terrified of the c word, Rebecca&#39;s love for her mother and her faith in God are put to the ultimate test. After watching her mother endure chemotherapy, endless doctor appointments, and hair loss, Rebecca learns how strong her mother is in the face of adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;The Diary of a Cancer Survivor&#39;s Daughter&lt;/I&gt; will help those who struggle to deal with a loved one&#39;s diagnosis. With candor, humor, and love, Rebecca relates her own personal story, offering hope and support for both the family and the patient.&lt;/p&gt;" />
