  <title>Counting the Days - Leslie Rutkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Counting the Days is a cop story and a love story that took place in the era
when corruption in the NYC police department was rampant, and the Knapp Commission was dominating headlines.  Matthew Smith, a decorated cop, had been handed $3000 after a drug bust  his share of the take. To accept the money would compromise his principles; not to take it would put his career in jeopardy.  Either way hed be in trouble. While on his honeymoon, Matthew was indicted on charges of grand larceny and went to prison for 366 days after refusing to turn states evidence against corrupt cops in the anti-crime unit. 
Counting the Days, written by Matthews wife, Leslie, based on more than 650 letters, cards and notes written by them while he was away, is the story of love and survival during a good cops incarceration.  A former prince of the street is trapped in the system he once championed, dealing with his own demons as well as befriending the kinds of men he had once locked up.  It is a story of integrity, honor, commitment and true friendships  and most of all an enduring love.  It is the story of Matthews new role, that of ex-felon, never truly free no matter how far he travels from his time in prison." />
