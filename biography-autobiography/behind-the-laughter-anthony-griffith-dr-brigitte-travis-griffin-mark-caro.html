  <title>Behind the Laughter - Anthony Griffith, Dr. Brigitte Travis-Griffin, Mark Caro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A couple&amp;rsquo;s powerful story of how God comforts us so that we can comfort others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Griffith, a stand-up comic from Chicago&amp;rsquo;s South Side, has lived on the borderline of comedy and tragedy. At the very time his career as a stand-up comedian was taking off, and he had finally achieved his dream of appearing on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/em&gt;, he was also enduring an unimaginable personal nightmare: his two-year-old daughter, Brittany Nicole, was dying from cancer. While Anthony performed under bright lights, he struggled not to succumb to the darkness of losing a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behind the Laughter&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;asks,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;When your world is falling apart, how do you keep going?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s the story of how Anthony and his wife, Brigitte, learned to endure the most painful of times and emerge on the other side of the &amp;ldquo;zombie years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This memoir is deeply moving yet also humorous&amp;mdash;packed with laughs as Anthony takes us from his gun-toting grandma&amp;rsquo;s home to Chicago&amp;rsquo;s white and black comedy clubs, then to Hollywood, and to the world of network television. The surprising twists along Anthony&amp;rsquo;s path highlight the power of God that goes before us and prepares the way&amp;mdash;a truth that later encourages Anthony and Brigitte after Brittany&amp;rsquo;s death and moves them to reach out and comfort others going through similar difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With humor and deep insights into the human spirit,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Behind the Laughter&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;explores the bonds of not only parent and child but also husband and wife. While Anthony and Brigitte&amp;rsquo;s story is uniquely theirs, it elicits powerful, relatable emotions and lessons that are universal and inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;" />
