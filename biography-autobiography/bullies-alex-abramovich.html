Then they lost track of each other. Decades later, when they met again, Abramovich was a writer and Latham had become President of the East Bay Rats, a motorcycle club in Oakland.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Abramovich moved to California to immerse himself in Latham&#39;s world - one of fight clubs, booze-filled nights, and beat-downs on the city&#39;s streets. But dangerous, dysfunctional Oakland was also becoming one of America&#39;s most rapidly gentrifying cities, and the questions Abramovich had arrived with were thrown into brutal relief: How do we live with the burden of violence? How do we overcome it?&lt;i&gt; Do &lt;/i&gt;we overcome it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Trevor, the Rats, and the city they live in careen between crises and moments of renaissance, Abramovich explores issues of friendship, family, history, and destiny - and looks at what happens when those things fail. &lt;i&gt;Bullies&lt;/i&gt; is at once a vivid, visceral narrative of an unusual friendship and an incisive portrait of a beautiful, terrible city.&lt;/p&gt;" />
