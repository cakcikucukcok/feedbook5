Pauls World takes us into the mind and heart of Paul, who was born with cerebral palsy into a family of normal siblings. Pauls unique personality exhibits manybut not allcharacteristics of what, until recently, had been referred to as Aspergers syndrome.

He meets that challenge with his outgoing personality, enthusiasm, and humorwinning friends everywhere he goes.
