  <title>The Biography of Tokumitsu Kanada - William, Yoko Trotter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Tokumitsu Kanada was alive, he once admonished his followers when they called him Founder, by saying, Im not a founder of our teaching. The founder is God. He was a very humble person, so if were to call him the founder of our teachings in this biography, he may not be pleased.
However, weas his followerswere saved from our sufferings and were guided by him, so he is unmistakably the founder of this teaching. We do not think its impolite to his departed soul to refer to him in this way. Also, with our love and respect for him, we his followers dont know how else to refer to him other than as the founder of this teaching. There are some religious leaders who refer to themselves as so-called founders and behave as though they are above others. Therefore, we would like to acknowledge that by calling him Founder it is not our intention to confuse him with some of these people." />
