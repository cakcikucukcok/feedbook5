  <title>The Best of All Possible Worlds - Steven Nadler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1672, the German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz arrived in Paris on a furtive diplomatic mission. That project was abandoned quickly, but Leibniz remained in Paris with a singular goal: to get the most out of the city&#39;s intellectual and cultural riches. He benefited, above all, from his friendships with France&#39;s two greatest philosopher-theologians of the period, Antoine Arnauld and Nicolas de Malebranche. The interactions of these three men would prove of great consequence not only for Leibniz&#39;s own philosophy but for the development of modern philosophical and religious thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their wildly different views and personalities, the three philosophers shared a single, passionate concern: resolving the problem of evil. Why is it that, in a world created by an allpowerful, all-wise, and infinitely just God, there is sin and suffering? Why do bad things happen to good people, and good things to bad people? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of a clash between radically divergent worldviews. But it is also a very personal story. At its heart are the dramatic--and often turbulent--relationships between three brilliant and resolute individuals. In this lively and engaging book, Steven Nadler brings to life a debate that obsessed its participants, captivated European intellectuals, and continues to inform our ways of thinking about God, morality, and the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
