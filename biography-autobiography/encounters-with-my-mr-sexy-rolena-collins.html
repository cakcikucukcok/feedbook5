  <title>Encounters with My Mr. Sexy - Rolena Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote these chapters to appeal to ALL women who just want to be loved and also the men who are looking for such women and want to keep them happy. The book Encounters with My Mr. Sexy is all about experiences that a woman can identify with her ideal man. Men, you dont have to be rich or famous to be romantic; just to make a woman feel special is a rare kind of romance. Find out what she likes, and relationships like anything else worth having. Take an effort from BOTH partners to build a good foundation.
Ladies, men like to feel special too; things like a massage are great for the ego. You must be able to relax, have fun, and smile for your man. Women, keep the lines of communication open, and never ever keep secrets. This is about some of the adventures we shared and how it has brought us closer together and made our bonds tighter and stronger. Quiet places, special places that only you two sharelove makes life like a fruit bowl lots of sweet things all put together in one special place for you to enjoy. That is just what we doenjoy life, and I keep it warm for big daddy." />
