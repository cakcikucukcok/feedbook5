  <title>Surviving Serendipity - Lawrence J. Enders, Lawrence J. Enders M.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This semblance of an autobiography was prompted by friends and family who were mesmerized by the amazing number of serendipitous events which so frequently dotted my life.
I personally believe that most people have experienced some similar happenings. In my case, these happenings just seemed so remotely unlikely for someone whose original goal in life was to be a very stable, home-town physician. As the story will reveal, what actually transpired was a far cry from that! Unusual incidents and unusual people became the usual.
The events in this book are real. They happened as they are portrayed, to the best of my recollections. The sequence of events is reasonably, chronologically correct. What was of enormous help was my considerable collection of memorabilia for me to reference.
The names and places are all real, with the exceptions of the FBI Agent and my three Russian KGB acquaintances. Since I believe they are all still alive, it is prudent to not reveal their identities.
I hope you will find these unusual, albeit real, experiences interesting." />
