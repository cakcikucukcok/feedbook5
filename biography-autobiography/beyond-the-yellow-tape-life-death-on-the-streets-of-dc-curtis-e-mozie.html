  <title>Beyond the Yellow Tape: Life &amp; Death on the Streets of Dc - Curtis E Mozie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Curtis Mozie, known on the streets as C-Webb is without a doubt a leader in Washington DC. He spends every waking moment trying to prevent gangs and gun violence on the streets of DC. With the creation of Tale of the Tape Foundation, Curtis produces films that document the lives and death of 65 of his friends murdered by gun violence. He has been a catalyst for positive change for over twenty years, earning&lt;br /&gt;the trust of both police officers and gang members having been a police officer himself, its incredible that gangs have allowed him to intimately explore their violent and brutal world. His video camera captures their day-to-day lives playing basketball and also their candidness in interviews at his apartment, which is known as the Safe House, a place where at risk youth come to be mentored on life skills, and to have someone hear their problems and concerns. When one of them gets killed or injured in gang violence, Curtis is there to mourn the lost with family members. He then creates a montage of their lives and deaths in a video tribute-lessons learned. Curtis without a doubt is a unique individual a community hero for DC Mothers, and Fathers. Hes appeared on numerous news media outlets across the world. His message is an unfaltering dedication and commitment to making the streets of DC safer for everyone. He now works at the Kennedy Recreation Center for the Department of Parks &amp; Recreation working with youth and serving the community.&lt;/p&gt;" />
