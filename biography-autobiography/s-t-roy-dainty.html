  <title>S**T - Roy Dainty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Five student civil engineers, including author Roy Dainty, find themselves caught up in a series of outrageous capers. No students have ever been more challenged by events than these featured in S**T. They fall in it, get covered in it, and cause it. Events kick off with Roy breaking into the sewers of Southampton before all five return to university in London, only to be sent off to geology and surveying field courses in Swaledale and Folkestone where havoc reins. Trying to make love on a collapsible campbed, being attacked by bullocks, becoming lost in a snowstorm, taking on the army, peeing off a church tower  oops the gravedigger is passing beneath  - and driving into a water meadow; these are some of the less chaotic events. 
S**T is a true autobiographical story, though you wont believe it, that captures the hilarious events of early 1973. Drunkenness and debauchery, danger and dalliance.  S**T includes it all. Only forty years on is it safe to tell these truths about life as student civil engineers." />
