  <title>Against the Tides: Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs - R.L. Franklin, Kyrah Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Against The Tides: Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs is a testimonial of the unyielding human spirit forging ahead despite the opposition and refusing to be conquered, even when the waves are contrary.--Anne McDuffie, Professor of English, Los Angeles Southwest College
Against the Tides: Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs invokes a sturdiness of spirit with far-reaching lessons. At the books heart is a wisdom derived from a deep faith that guides each generation. In these lives, obstacles are turned into opportunities, and are no match against a long inheritance of inspiration and hard work. In Against the Tides, it is impossible not to find enduring messages that enrich our own lives.--Gretchen Roberts-Shorter, Author of Cant Remember Playing
The reality of the stories in Against the Tides: Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs will touch the mind, heart, and spirit of readers, allowing them to reflect on lifes journeys and the paths that lead to self-determination and victory over our struggles!--Wilmer Amina Carter, Former California Assembly Member Sixty-Second District
The stories provide a unique perspective that is insightful and refreshing and simultaneously familiar because many of us as individuals and families have faced similar experiences. Against The Tides: Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs has the potential to connect Baby Boomers with Generation Xers and Millennials over shared family history.--Obadiah J.K. Simmons, Jr., Ph.D (Grambling State University) Ruston, Louisiana" />
