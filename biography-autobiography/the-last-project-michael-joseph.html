  <title>The Last Project - Michael Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine a world renowned theme park in one of the most popular cities on earth where millions of families have saved for months, sometimes years, to take their family for a once in a lifetime experience. Almost overnight it becomes the central locale for organized crime. In the middle of this criminal organization stands one defenseless man who must battle the cynical leader and his lieutenants of an organized crime outfit known locally as the Circle. To save himself and his family, he must also face and conquer his own demons inside first. This is inspired by true events that will fascinate you beyond your wildest imagination. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Circle is controlled by an extremely wealthy, eccentric and envious individual whose corruption can only be rivaled by that of an evil dictator. A reputable and much respected construction manager has no choice but to stand toe to toe with the Circle and its leader to protect his family. The lies, deception, betrayal and greed will change many lives forever. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
His life, family and friends begin to slip away and he must decide to face his reality and risk his own fate. Michael is out to prove he will give his life to save his familys life through his actions, not just words.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Last Project was nearly the last act Michael performed to save his wife, he and his childrens life. Now it has become a David versus Goliath saga that will drive your desire for more, page after page and chapter after chapter." />
