  <title>Pride: The Unlikely Story of the True Heroes of the Miners&#39; Strike - Tim Tate, Lgsm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1984, a small group of metropolitan homosexual men and lesbian women stepped away from the vibrant culture and hedonism of London&#39;s defiant gay scene to befriend and support the beleaguered villages of a very traditional mining community in the remote valleys of South Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did so in the midst of the 1984 miners&#39; strike - the most bitter and divisive dispute for more than half a century, and in one of the most turbulent periods in modern British history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s Margaret Thatcher&#39;s hardcore social and fiscal policies devastated Britain&#39;s traditional industries, and at the same time, AIDS began to claim lives across the nation. At the very height of this perfect storm, as the government and police battled &#39;the enemy within&#39; in communities across the land and newspapers whipped up fear of the gay &#39;perverts&#39; who were supposedly responsible for inflicting this lethal new pestilence upon the entire population, two groups who ostensibly had nothing in common - miners and homosexuals - unexpectedly made a stand together and forged a lasting friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an alliance which helped keep an entire valley clothed and fed during the darkest months of the strike. And it led directly to a long-overdue acceptance by trades unions and the Labour Party that homosexual equality was a cause to be championed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pride&lt;/i&gt; tells the inspiring true story of how two very different communities - each struggling to overcome its own bitter internal arguments and long-established fault lines, as well as facing the power of a hostile government and press found common cause against overwhelming odds. And how this one simple but unlikely act of friendship would, in time, help change life in Britain - forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
