  <title>David Watmough&#39;s 2-Book Bundle - David Watmough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David Watmough, often spoken of as Canada’s senior gay male fiction writer, has committed his memories to paper in &lt;i&gt;Myself Through Others&lt;/i&gt;. Watmough is well-known for his fiction featuring gay &quot;everyman&quot; Davey Bryant, and the novel &lt;i&gt;The Moor is Dark Beneath the Moon&lt;/i&gt; is bundled together in this special 2-book collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Moor is Dark Beneath the Moon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Davey Bryant returns to England for the funeral of a mysterious relative and lands in an inheritance squabble that threatens to escalate into something far worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Myself Through Others: Memoirs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Given the autobiographical nature of his fiction, the prolific raconteur has opted for a novel approach to his own life by telling his story through his encounters with the numerous people he has met, befriended, loved, and jousted with over the years. And what a parade of personalities it is! Watmough serves up incisive, trenchant, often witty profiles of writers W.H. Auden, T.S. Eliot, Stephen Spender, Raymond Chandler, Tennessee Williams, Carol Shields, Margaret Laurence, Jane Rule, and Wallace Stegner; artists Bill Reid and Jack Shadbolt; politicians and celebrities Pierre Trudeau, Clement Atlee, and Eleanor Roosevelt; Hollywood actress Jean Arthur; and a host of others." />
