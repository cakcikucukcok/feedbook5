  <title>What Was Not Said - Sean M. Teaford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Holocaust is a subject all of us are aware of but there are countless accounts that are seldom heard. Based on the diaries, letters, and memoirs of Hertha Feiner, Janusz Korczak, and Filip Mller, these poems describe the life surrounding these writings.
Every memoir has something missing. This is not a conscious decision by the author; it is the perspective of the writer filtered through the impermanence of memory. Sometimes it is a forgotten foreshadowing phrase said in passing or what is happening outside when their focus is on the room in which they are sitting. These are the aspects painted in this collection.
To feel and help others feel the suffering of others has always been the mark of a genuine talent. Teaford has it.
 Samuel Hazo, Former Poet Laureate of Pennsylvania
These are wonderful, haunting poems.
 Sandra Costich, The American Scholar
Teaford has the sort of power poets crave, the power to touch hearts, capture moments, and express the often inexpressible.
- Laurel Johnson, The Midwest Book Review
One can only marvel at the fine line of demarcation Teaford draws between compassion and craft in his moving work.
 James William Chichetto, Stonehill College
Teaford has taken a chance with material that is far removed from his experience, and has done an admirable job. The poetry is sober and understated, and reveals the tragedy without bombast.
 DougHolder, Ibbetson Street Press
This collection is a must-read. It powerfully continues the historic admonition: Never Forget!
