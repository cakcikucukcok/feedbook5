  <title>A Hairdresser&#39;s Experience in High Life - Eliza Potter, Xiomara Santamarina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here is the first fully annotated edition of a landmark in early African American literature--Eliza Potter&#39;s 1859 autobiography, &lt;i&gt;A Hairdresser&#39;s Experience in High Life&lt;/i&gt;. Potter was a freeborn black woman who, as a hairdresser, was in a unique position to hear about, receive confidences from, and observe wealthy white women--and she recorded it all in a revelatory book that delighted Cincinnati&#39;s gossip columnists at the time. But more important is Potter&#39;s portrait of herself as a wage-earning woman, proud of her work, who earned high pay and accumulated quite a bit of money as one of the nation&#39;s earliest &quot;beauticians&quot; at a time when most black women worked at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. Because her work offered insights into the private lives of elite white women, Potter carved out a literary space that featured a black working woman at the center, rather than at the margins, of the era&#39;s transformations in gender, race, and class structure. Xiomara Santamarina provides an insightful introduction to this edition that includes newly discovered information about Potter, discusses the author&#39;s strong satirical voice and proud working-class status, and places the narrative in the context of nineteenth-century literature and history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
