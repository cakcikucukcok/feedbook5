  <title>Like Yesterday - MJ Santangelo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Like Yesterday: There are some major world events in life that affect us deeper than others. These events often catch us off guard, cause change in the world or within us and are imprinted on our brain so strongly that we can remember exactly where we were and what we were doing when the event happened. For some people that event was the day Kennedy was shot or when Martin Luther King Jr. gave his &#39;I Had a Dream Speech&#39;. Or when they learned Princess Diana was killed. For me, that major world event was September 11, 2001, when the World Trade Center Twin Towers were attacked. No matter how long it has been since this event occurred, it is ingrained in my mental history. I was only a couple of blocks away when the attacks happened, attending my first year of college at Pace University in lower Manhattan.  In this short story I tell my account of what I experienced in the days leading up to September 11th, the day itself, and the days that followed. This is my answer to where were you on September 11, 2001?" />
