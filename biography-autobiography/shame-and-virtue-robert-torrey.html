  <title>Shame and Virtue - Robert Torrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE GREATEST OF ALL IMPOSTORS 
Once the purpose of using love to realize an objective has been satisfied, it is no longer of use. Exposed are a conniving ingenuity and an extraordinary capacity to deceive 
...Helen, of course, was much too experienced to allow anyone to walk all over her. Cathy at one time told Helen, Your ninety years old Helen, you need to straighten up 
Further, while stealing from Helen he allowed her to be verbally abused and physically assaulted by his partner. He saw nothing wrong that his own sister, a ninety one year old widow, was being assaulted by a person one hundred fifty pounds heavier and twenty three years younger 
 We have seventy years, and if we are strong we get eighty. Just how strong and blessed is Helen to reach ninety two. Her remaining years may be spent peacefully or in pain and sorrow. Only God knows how many more years she has and how they will be spent. We hope she, at least, reaches one hundred if not more
