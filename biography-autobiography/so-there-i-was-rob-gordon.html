  <title>So There I Was... - Rob Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This book is a collection of my all-time favorite stories from working with patients as a medical professional over the past seventeen years. I have witnessed and been a part of some amazing experiences ranging from hilarious to shocking to just plain disgusting. I&#39;ve told these stories many times at family gatherings, parties, and in conversations with friends. After much encouragement, I took the time to write them down before they became distant memories. Each chapter of this book is dedicated to a specific incident, which should give the reader an inside look into the often entertaining world of a health care provider. The names, of course, have been changed to protect the innocent, but I didn&#39;t leave out or alter any of the colorful details.&lt;/P&gt;" />
