  <title>Stolen Girl - Katie Taylor, Veronica Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;Stolen Girl &lt;/I&gt;tells the story of a schoolgirl, Katie Taylor, who was systematically groomed and raped by a group of predatory Asian men. They separated her from her friends and passed her between them, violating her and treating her as a sexual plaything. But&amp;#160;the worst&amp;#160;was yet to come because Katie was contacted by Zeb, the evil ringleader. He lured her with drugs and alcohol before raping her at a secret house, his private lair, where he exploited and abused young girls. Zeb was calculating and sadistic. He introduced others into the grooming ring until Katie felt she had no option but to comply with his perverse desires. The abuse continued for two agonizing years until Zeb came up with an even more sickening plan. Scared for her life, Katie was trapped. She needed to tell someone, but who could she turn to and how would she escape the clutches of these depraved men? &lt;I&gt;Stolen Girl&lt;/I&gt; is the shocking true story of lost childhood innocence. But it is also one of hope and how Katie found the courage and strength not only to escape her abusers but also to bring them to justice.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
