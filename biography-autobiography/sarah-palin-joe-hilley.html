  <title>Sarah Palin - Joe Hilley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our present era demands a new style of leadership that transcends political affiliation and party lines. In an age that values relationship over authority and instant information over accuracy, breadth of knowledge and depth of conviction are prized commodities. Governor Sarah Palin (R&amp;mdash;Alaska) brings both of those qualities to her new role as candidate for the vice presidency of the United States. Her familiarity with a broad range of issues and her strong moral center are just two of the leadership traits that have allowed Palin to organize and focus her efforts in elected office. Exploring themes from her career in politics, her life as a hockey mom, and her strongly held Christian faith, author Joe Hilley&amp;rsquo;s biographical leadership study of Sarah Palin explores the leadership principles that have catapulted her into the national spotlight and explains how she models a fresh paradigm of leadership that will guide our nation through the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
