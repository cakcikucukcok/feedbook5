  <title>A Journey of Creative Healing - Mary Atkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In a time so in need of true elders to guide the coming generations, Mary is a shining example of someone who walks her talk, whose purpose in life is to serve and encourage others to be true to themselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;KIMBA AREM, MUSIC THERAPIST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I need to put my focus on being creative. I need to create something new each day. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what&amp;mdash;I simply need to focus on the planning and joy of creativity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Mary Atkins was a young mother of two small children when her husband was tragically killed in a light aircraft accident. Her body, already exhibiting signs that something was amiss, bore the brunt of this tragedy and at the age of 27 she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Doctors told her she would be wheelchair-bound within months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But that&amp;rsquo;s not what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Instead, Mary recovered. Her journey to wellness began when she acted on a powerful intuitive voice that suggested she undertake a strict daily program of creative expression&amp;mdash;to plan, create or do something she had never done before.&amp;nbsp; Within twelve months she could once again walk without aids. She has now been in full remission from MS for more than fifty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In A Journey of Creative Healing Mary shares her remarkable story&amp;mdash;and those of other survivors who have endured equally debilitating emotional and physical shocks&amp;mdash;and reveals how listening to your intuitive voice, exploring creativity in all its guises, can deliver recovery from overwhelming grief and profound illness. By following her six steps to healing Mary believes you too can find your way home to health.&lt;/p&gt;" />
