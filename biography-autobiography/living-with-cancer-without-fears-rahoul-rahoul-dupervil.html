  <title>Living with Cancer Without Fears - Rahoul, Rahoul Dupervil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Living with Cancer without fears is a personal and informative guide, that details my personal fight with cancer on an ongoing battle on different fronts: Colon, Rectal, Prostate and Bladder:  that not only affects me but my surroundings.  This so-called Death Sentence, had plagued my life long before I was diagnosed. I watched my father battle this disease for many years. The recognition of his strength, his faith, his character, and will power in this battle had groomed me for the same fight.  My father was fearless, and he never abandoned his sense of optimism no matter how awful the disease was affecting him.  He never gave the disease any power. I would walk in my fathers footsteps when I started battling this cancer disease, and through faith, understanding, and optimism.  I am the replica of this character. Search for Infinity should be our main goal in this battlefield.  Whatever our knowledge and experience in this passage, our target should be one goal: The Infinity.  Only He can protect and give life to those that are in conformity with the main idea of creation of human being.  As an inheritance of Gods power through reasoning, the choice is ours to make the right decision to overcome adversity and reach our minds potential. My mind is powerful, through that concept, I have learned to be at ease in self and I carry this attitude with me in all my walks of life. I am fearless.  I hope that I will inspire life to all I come in contact with whether they are battling this disease or not to walk alongside me as I give you a look into my journey." />
