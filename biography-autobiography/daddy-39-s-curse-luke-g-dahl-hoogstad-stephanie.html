      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Harrowing True Story of an Eight Year Old Girl Human Sex Trafficking and Organized Crime Survivor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever experienced total despair? Yuna was just an eight year old girl when she experienced total devastation. Growing up in the Mongolian countryside, she wasn&amp;#39;t ready to face the darker side of the world. And yet she had to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After she was kidnapped by an organized crime gang, Yuna had to overcome her fears at a young age and start taking care of herself. She tried to escape from slavery, but everybody that she encountered wanted to take advantage of her. Yuna and other girls just like her were constantly abused, beaten, raped and sold as sex slaves. Human trafficking is the worst kind of humiliation, especially for a young woman. She tried to escape and find freedom, but it wasn&amp;#39;t easy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this emotional and heart-shattering true story, author Luke G. Dahl will let you behind the curtains of sex trafficking gangs and into the soul of abused women, who try to glue the broken pieces of their soul together, in order to survive. By understanding what they have had to endure, you can find a new perspective and respect for life.&lt;br /&gt;
