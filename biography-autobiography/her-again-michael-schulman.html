Burning with talent and ambition, she was like dozens of aspiring actors of the time&amp;#8212;a twenty-something beauty who rode her bike everywhere, kept a diary, napped before performances, and stayed out late &amp;#8220;talking about acting with actors in actors&amp;#8217; bars.&amp;#8221; Yet Meryl stood apart from her peers. In her first season in New York, she won attention-getting parts in back-to-back Broadway plays, a Tony Award nomination, and two roles in Shakespeare in the Park productions.
