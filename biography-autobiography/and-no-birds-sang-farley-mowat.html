  <title>And No Birds Sang - Farley Mowat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Turned away from the Royal Canadian Air Force for his apparent youth and frailty, Farley Mowat joined the infantry in 1940. The young second lieutenant soon earned the trust of the soldiers under his command, and was known to bend army rules to secure a stout drink, or find warm - if non-regulation - clothing. But when Mowat and his regiment engaged with elite German forces in the mountains of Sicily, the optimism of their early days as soldiers was replaced by despair. With a naturalist&#39;s eyes and ears, Mowat takes in the full dark depths of war - and his moving account of military service, and the friends he left behind, is also a plea for peace. It is one of the most searing and unforgettable World War II memoirs from any Canadian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Haunting. Maddening. Frightening. At times, even hilarious. There aren't enough adjectives, or enough space on a book jacket, for me to praise Farley Mowat enough." (Joseph Boyden, author of Three Day Road)<br /><b><i>And No Birds Sang: Mowat, Farley: 9781771000307: Amazon ...</i></b> | During World War II, Farley Mowat fought in Italy and Sicily with the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment. And No Birds Sang is the gripping eyewitness account of a young man in combat, detailing everything from how he lost his virginity to his growing disenchantment with war.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: And No Birds Sang (9780864922823): Mowat ...</i></b> | Farley Mowat was himself an officer in the Hastings and Prince Edward Regt,(nicknamed the Hasty Pees), so the book is a first hand account of the action. I not only recommend this book but any Farley Mowat book to give you a taster of a truly great Canadian.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>And No Birds Sang - Farley Mowat</a> </h3></p><hr/>
