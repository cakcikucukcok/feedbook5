  <title>I Am White - Rita Makkanaw, Carina Christensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;I Am White: Eagle Woman Flies with Raven&lt;/i&gt; shares the biography of Rita Makkannaw, who immigrated from Denmark to Canada at a very young age with her family. After enduring a sexually charged incident with her father, she ran away from home at age sixteen. She entered into an abusive marriage, but managed to obtain an education, career, and raise two children in spite of her troubles. 
Then in 1987, at age forty, Rita began to have many new spiritual experiences, discovering in the process a completely new world. She met and fell in love with a Cree First Nations Medicine Man, Raven Makkannaw. With her new relationship, she began a twenty-year apprenticeship in spirituality, native history, and philosophy. Raven and Rita devoted their lives to bringing understanding and harmony to the modern world. Their message was that the old teachings were as relevant today as they were for hundreds of generations past. Human nature has not changedit is only that we live our lives in very different ways.
&lt;i&gt;I Am White&lt;/i&gt; presents the memoir of a woman who immersed herself in Cree culture after finding the love of her life. It is a story of a life transformed by love, spirituality, and acceptance." />
