  <title>Not My Spine - Esosa Ruth Ikolo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Not My Spine is a compelling, revealing and true story about a mother&#39;s experience during the pregnancy of her first child, and also after the birth. It describes a mysterious illness which she began to suffer a long time before she was pregnant, the level of inattentiveness by her doctor&#39;s and the extent of damage it brought to her. It also captured the aftermath of the lack of knowledge by Esosa and her doctors who embraced the symptoms of this illness as those induced by pregnancy.
Faced with the very real possibility of permanent paralysis, she fought to recover her lost willpower and hope, in order to live the life she had always dreamed.
Her courage to share what she suffered as a result of this ordeal is encouraging and unravels so much information for everyone. This book which shows strength, courage and faith in the face of adversity, is a must read for everyone living in every part of the world who cares to know about a disease which can lurk unsuspected for several years before reaching out to cause harm. 
It is thought provoking, revealing as well as inspiring, providing potentially lifesaving information." />
