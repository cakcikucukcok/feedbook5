  <title>Writing the Okanagan - George Bowering</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;George Bowering was born in Penticton, where his great-grandfather Willis Brinson lived, and Bowering has never been all that far from the Okanagan Valley in his heart and imagination. Early in the twenty-first century, he was made a permanent citizen of Oliver. Bowering has family up and down the Valley, and he goes there as often as he can. He has been asked during his many visits to Okanagan bookstores over the years to publish a collection of his writing about the Valley.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Writing the Okanagan&lt;/I&gt; draws on forty books Bowering has published since 1960 &amp;#150; poetry, fiction, history, and some forms he may have invented. Selections from&lt;I&gt; Delsing&lt;/I&gt; (1961) and &lt;I&gt;Sticks &amp; Stones&lt;/I&gt; (1962) are here, as is &amp;#147;Driving to Kelowna&amp;#8221; from &lt;I&gt;The Silver Wire&lt;/I&gt; (1966). Other Okanagan towns, among them Rock Creek, Peachland, Vernon, Kamloops, Princeton, and Osoyoos, inspire selections from work published through the 1970s and on to 2013. Fairview, the old mining site near Oliver, is the focus of an excerpt from &lt;I&gt;Caprice&lt;/I&gt; (1987, 2010), one volume in Bowering&amp;#8217;s trilogy of historical novels. &amp;#147;Desert Elm&amp;#8221; takes as its two main subjects the Okanagan Valley and his father, who, as Bowering did, grew up there. With the addition of some previously unpublished works, the reader will find the wonder of the Okanagan here, in both prose and poetry.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
