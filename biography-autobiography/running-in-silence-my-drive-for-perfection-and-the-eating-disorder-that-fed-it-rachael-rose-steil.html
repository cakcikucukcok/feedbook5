  <title>Running in Silence: My Drive for Perfection and the Eating Disorder that Fed it - Rachael Rose Steil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;It had been hours since I ran at track practice that winter, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t bothered to shower, let alone change clothes. &lt;/strong&gt;No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for that, because I had found the answer to my prayers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This has to be it.&lt;br /&gt; Eat all the fruit you want.&lt;br /&gt; Never get fat.&lt;br /&gt; Raw. Food. Diet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rachael Steil clocked in as an All-American collegiate runner; she became a girl clawing for a comeback on a 30-bananas-a-day diet. This year-long struggle with raw food ended when she realized she had to find her self-respect beyond her identity as a successful runner on a perfect diet. Running in Silence opens the door on the secret world of eating disorders. It provides vital insights for those who don&amp;rsquo;t suffer from this disease and an honest and harrowing personal story for those who do. Steil challenges the stigma of eating disorders, looks past appearance, and dives into the heart of obsession.&lt;/p&gt;" />
