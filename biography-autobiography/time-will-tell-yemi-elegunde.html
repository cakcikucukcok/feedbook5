  <title>Time Will Tell - Yemi Elegunde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I was just a little boy of seven years old, my younger sister and I were taken away from England by my dad without my mums knowledge or consent. We lived and grew up in Nigeria, the only communication we had with mum was by letters.
This is the story of the events through the eyes of that seven year old child, from the moment he realised he was in a different country, the stark change of culture, the new family and the voyage of self-discovery.
The book covers this boys rollercoaster young life of apprehensions and ecstasy; his rebellions, and his loves. It follows his anger as he grew from boy to teenager and his eventual reconciliation with himself and his parents.
What kind of man would that boy grow up to be? Only Time Will Tell." />
