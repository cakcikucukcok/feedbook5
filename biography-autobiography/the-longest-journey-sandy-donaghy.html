Whether you are in debt, experiencing chemical dependency, homeless, lonely, depressed - or simply want to be happier and healthier, this book can change your life for the better. Sandy takes you through the nine keys one at a time using his own life experiences to illustrate how each key is applied. This is not a book on theory but one of proven practicality. This book will change your life - no question - from fear and doubt to one of joy and hope.&lt;p&gt;

No matter how bleak your life may be at this moment, I promise you that reading this book and working the 9 keys will transform your life.
