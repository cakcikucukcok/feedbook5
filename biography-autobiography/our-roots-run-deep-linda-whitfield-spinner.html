  <title>Our Roots Run Deep - Linda Whitfield-Spinner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the old clich goes, you can&#39;t know where you are going until you know where you have been; knowing ones roots helps you to realize where you fit in life. The retelling of family stories from one person to the next is as old as time. Young and old alike find that discovering one&#39;s roots is exciting and personally rewarding. As a family, we share a common bond and kinship.
The information shared in this booklet was gathered through oral histories, written records, family Bibles, ancestry.com, state health records, family reunion booklets, and national census data.
Sources through interviews with family members tell us that Warren Moore (1841) and his parents Dock Moore and Edy Moore, arrived in the United States as slaves sometime around the midnineteenth century. The family initially lived and worked on the Albritton plantation in Pitt County, North Carolina. Warren Moore married Harriet Langley (1844). Cobby Moore (1878), the main patriarchal focus for this project, was one of Warren and Harriet&#39;s eighteen children.
The following pages contain sketches of the lives of Cobby Moore, his three wives, and each one of Cobby&#39;s eighteen children. These short vignettes describe the general characteristics of each family member and tell the story of a family&#39;s place in American society." />
