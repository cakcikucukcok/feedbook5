  <title>Waiting to Be Heard - Amanda Knox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amanda Knox spent four years in a foreign prison for a crime she did not commit, as seen in the Nexflix documentary &lt;em&gt;Amanda Knox&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2007, the 20-year-old college coed left Seattle to study abroad in Italy, but her life was shattered when her roommate was murdered in their apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a controversial trial, Amanda was convicted and imprisoned. But in 2011, an appeals court overturned the decision and vacated the murder charge. Free at last, she returned home to the U.S., where she has remained silent, until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with details first recorded in the journals Knox kept while in Italy, Waiting to Be Heard is a remarkable story of innocence, resilience, and courage, and of one young woman&amp;#8217;s hard-fought battle to overcome injustice and win the freedom she deserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With intelligence, grace, and candor, Amanda Knox tells the full story of her harrowing ordeal in Italy&amp;#8212;a labyrinthine nightmare of crime and punishment, innocence and vindication&amp;#8212;and of the unwavering support of family and friends who tirelessly worked to help her win her freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Waiting to Be Heard&lt;/em&gt; includes 24 pages of color photographs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
