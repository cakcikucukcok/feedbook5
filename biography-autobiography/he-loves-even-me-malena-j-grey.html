  <title>He Loves Even Me - Malena J Grey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The majority of people desire good over evil. Most of Elizabeths life is a contradiction of this. Blessed with beauty, brains, and talent, her early life is filled with every type of abuse. She embarks on a dramatic and tortuous journey, full of fear, failure, guilt and hope. She is determined to experience real love, but doesnt consult God about how to do this His way. This brings hard lessons, spilling onto others along the way and causing much heartache. Despair finally drives her back to her Heavenly Father. During childhood she escaped the hopelessness through her nightly flying dreamspraying Jesus would scoop her into His loving arms and take her to heaven so she would never have to return. Finally, as God fills her with His love and joyful peace, she loses her need for the dreams. Gods loving approval is her hearts deepest desire.&lt;/p&gt;" />
