  <title>Incoming...The Men of the 70Th - Jack Manick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was a monumental year...the Mamas and Papas, The Beach Boys, Bob Dylan and scores of world famous rock groups poured out their sweet music and wonderful lyrics to a generation of young people in search of themselves. In July, what was thought to be impossible became possible...Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon and for one shining moment in October, the NY Mets were no longer to be laughed at...they won the 1969 World Series! The year was 1969!
While earth shaking events were happening two hundred thousand miles from home or deep within the confines of Shea Stadium, men of every race, education and age group were fighting and dying 12,000 miles from home in Americas most unpopular war, Vietnam. 
Today, 40 years later, writer, husband and Veteran Jack Manick reaches into his soul for one last time and completes his account of a young medic as he walked the jungles and forests of the Central Highlands of Vietnam in 1969. 
While in the Bush, he carried a pack, a medical aid bag, two knives, three grenades, a rifle, pistol and an unbreakable commitment to save the lives of his fellow soldiers, even at the cost of his own. 
The story of Jack Doc Manick and his fellow soldiers is one of survival...survival in a country laden with malaria, crawling with venomous snakes, scorpions, rats, giant centipedes and tigers and dominated by an enemy determined Not to lose the War! 
Incoming...The Men of the 70th, invites you to lace up your jungle boots and take a walk with Jack through the jungles and the fields of dry grass in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in 1969." />
