  <title>Just How It Was - Jim Blagg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My son Jeff was looking for anything pertaining to my ship, USS Polaris, on the Internet.  He came across Korean War Veterans.  Then, he picked out Navy, and then Ship reunions.  I didnt know until 1999 that the Polaris held a reunion each year.  Its not a large group, but weve bonded like family.  We look forward to meeting for the reunion held each year in a different U.S. city.  In this group, I want to give special thanks to Bill Scott and Lee Nunez for the hours they put into keeping these reunions running smoothly.  Anyone who served aboard the Polaris, World War II through its 1957 when it was decommissioned, is welcomed to our reunion.

Sayonara to all the little farms with their neat, little vegetable gardens and rice patties, the familiar chug-chug of the fishing boats, the tunes of China Night and Kum-Kum Monsume, and the shy, little children who dont know what to make of Americans.  Sayonara to the beautiful scenery created by trees with their lacy leaves in different shades of green, and the light, drifting snow flurries in winter." />
