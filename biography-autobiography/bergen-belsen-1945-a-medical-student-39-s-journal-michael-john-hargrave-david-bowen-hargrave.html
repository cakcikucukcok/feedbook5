  <title>Bergen-Belsen 1945: A Medical Student&#39;s Journal - Michael John Hargrave, David Bowen Hargrave</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Between 1941 and 1945 as many as 70,000 inmates died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in northwestern Germany.

On the day of his departure the 21-year-old learned that he was being sent to Bergen-Belsen, liberated only two weeks before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This firsthand account, a diary written for his mother, details Michael&amp;#x0027;s month-long experience at the camp.

Amidst immeasurable horrors, his descriptions of the banalities of everyday life and diagrams of the camp&amp;#x0027;s layout take on a new poignancy, while anatomic line drawings detail the medical conditions and his efforts to treat them.
