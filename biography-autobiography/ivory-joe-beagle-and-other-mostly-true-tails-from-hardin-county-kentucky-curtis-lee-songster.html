  <title>Ivory Joe Beagle: and Other Mostly True Tails from Hardin County, Kentucky - Curtis Lee Songster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Travel back to a time before television, when good times came by way of an occasional coon hunt and the annual county fair, when friends carried out wild pranks on their friends but always had each other&#39;s backs.  Ivory Joe Beagle, the ever-present canine companion to all, weaves his way in and out of these mostly true &quot;tails&quot; of Hardin County, Kentucky, during the good ol&#39; days of the 1940s and &#39;50s.  Herein you&#39;ll meet the likes of Lone Carby, Digger, and Odel, plus the rest of a lovable, eclectic group of friends whose all-in-good-fun antics (detailed instructions on how to make the best pea shooter included) are unforgettable and worthy of retelling again and again.  Prepare to laugh out loud as Dr. Songster shares his memories of growing up during a time when &quot;independence, self-reliance, and family were givens and a man&#39;s word was his bond.&quot;  A heart-warming blend of facts (you&#39;ll learn more than you need to know about the American buffalo) and fiction (some improvisation may have taken place), not without a touch of sentiment, Ivory Joe Beagle is a book to be shared and passed along to friends as easily as gossip is relayed at the local general store.  Friends, you&#39;ll be chuckling long before you can say: &#39;Looky, looky, it&#39;s the elusive wampus cat!&quot;" />
