  <title>Mental - Bad Behaviour, Ugly Truths and the Beautiful Game - Jermaine Pennant, John Cross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;’I&#39;ve seen things no one else has seen in football.&#39;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jermaine Pennant is one of English football&#39;s most controversial figures. Love him or loathe him, there is no ignoring the story he has to tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raised by a mother who faked her own death to abandon her black baby, and a father who kept guns and Class A drugs in the house meant that life&#39;s options for a young Jermaine were limited. Yet he saw professional football as his way out, and took his chance, emerging to be one of England&#39;s most gifted young footballers. A true prodigy, Jermaine climbed to the pinnacle of his sport to compete for the highest honours with legends at Arsenal and Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy from one of England&#39;s toughest neighbourhoods was barely into his twenties and rich beyond his wildest dreams. But, for Jermaine, some of life&#39;s most important lessons were learned late. His outrageous lifestyle would spark a fall from the dizzying heights he had reached, ensuring he&#39;d be remembered as much for being the &#39;mental yob&#39; with an ankle tag as for his heroic performance in a Champions League final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jermaine Pennant has seen and done it all - the highs, the lows and everything in between. His autobiography is a gritty coming-of-age story, an exposé into the excess-fuelled life of a super-rich Premier League footballer, and a cautionary tale of the dangers of plying young players with too much, too young. His turbulent climb through the battleground of the beautiful game holds a mirror up to the broken face of English football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told with unblinking truth, his story is a no-holds-barred riot of determination and debauchery, excellence and excess.&lt;/p&gt;" />
