  <title>Cerf Berr of Médelsheim 1726–1793 - Margaret R. O’Leary, Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    On December 7, 1793, an old man lay motionless at last, surrounded by his family, rabbis, and members of the society who would prepare his body for Jewish
    burial. Sixteen days after he was sentenced to jail, his family would go to extraordinary efforts to bury him in a Jewish cemetery ordered destroyed by the
    French government just two weeks earlier. The old man was Cerf Berr of Mdelsheim, the tenacious eighteenth-century Ashkenazi emancipator of the French
    Jews.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Margaret R. OLeary, MD, presents Cerf Berrs life story, recognizing his profound contributions to the liberation of the Jews of France. While chronicling
    his incredible journey, OLeary not only highlights Cerf Berrs scrupulous honesty and reliability that earned him the deep appreciation of the French
    Crown, but also details how he besieged authorities in both Strasbourg and Versailles to grant political, social, and economic equality for all of his
    coreligionists in France. Cerf Berr achieved that milestone on September 27, 1791, only to die two years later after imprisonment by sadistic French
    revolutionaries.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Cerf Berr of Mdelsheim is the biography of a man who was faithful to his people, sought the good for the community, and cherished justiceall while making
    a momentous contribution to the history of France and the Jews.
