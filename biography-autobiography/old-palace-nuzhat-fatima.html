  <title>Old Palace - Nuzhat Fatima</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a nonfiction book about a lady spirit who came out of the bottle and roamed the city, proposing her marriage and offering the old palace. After some time, that spirit was caught by one man, captured in a bottle, and buried under the land. 
It was a real event in Hyderabad City in India. People got very scared because of this event and stopped going outside at night. The book tells the story of the spirit in the book and talks about Indian culture. You will learn about Indian history, dresses, and traditions. 
It is different from others because in this novel, the spirit of the lady was proposing her marriage and offering the old palace. It includes the struggles of my life also. In my life, I used to try to achieve my goal, so people should try again and again. They must try again and again because sometimes, the last key of the key chain opens the lock." />
