  <title>Rather His Own Man - Geoffrey Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this witty, engrossing and sometimes poignant memoir, a sequel to his best-selling The Justice Game, Geoffrey Robertson charts his progress from pimply state schoolboy to top Old Bailey barrister and thence onwards and upwards to a leading role in the struggle for human rights throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wryly observes the passion of student protest in Australia in the sixties and his early crusades for ‘Down Under-dogs’, before leaving on a Rhodes Scholarship to combat the British establishment, with the help of John Mortimer of Rumpole fame. There are dramatic accounts of fighting for lives on death row, freeing dissidents and taking on tyrants, armed only with a unique mind and a passion for justice – on display whenever he boomeranged back to Australia to conduct Geoffrey Robertson’s Hypotheticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His is an amazing life story of David vs. Goliath battles – laugh-out-loud tales filled with romance and danger, featuring a cast of characters ranging from General Pinochet to Pee-Wee Herman; from Malcolm Turnbull to Mike Tyson; from Nigella Lawson to Kathy Lette and Julian Assange. Throughout his exploits – recounted here with irreverent humour and dashes of true wisdom – Geoffrey Robertson has remained determinedly independent and his own man. He has also, in respect of human rights, changed the way we think.&lt;/p&gt;" />
