  <title>Me, My Mother, My Life - Ayomide Adeniola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Me, My Mother, My life is a poetic journey through the trials of a young
woman who longed to break free of the burden of an oppressive family
legacy. Beautifully narrated, the author unblinkingly examines her life
experiences, telling her story in a way that only one who has deeply
experienced life, love, and God could portray.
Born in London to Nigerian parents, Ayomide spent her childhood and
young adulthood in the country of her parents origin where life for this
young British girl was to be grabbed by both hands with spirit, good
humour, and great resolve. When she returned to England, her faith in
God led her on an odyssey to heal the generational issues with which she
had long been faced.
Beyond its value as a beautifully-constructed and gripping memoir, this
book leads the readers into their own private journey of reflection on
their personal relationships, containing the wisdom of emotional and
spiritual healing as well as personal growth. Not for the faint-hearted,
Me, My Mother, My Life will deepen your understanding of life, love, and
the value of forgiveness.
A well-written personal tale of a womans trials of the spirit and her
passage to healing.
-Kirkus
Adeniola writes well and is a sensitive observer ... the trajectory of her
life from her student days in Nigeria to her professional life in England is
genuinely interesting. Her writing is informed by her Christian faith, but
not in a way that puts off more secular readers.
-BlueInk
Culture clash meets generation gap in this memoir by Ayomide
Adeniola ... Adeniolas memoir remains compelling because of the
strong family bond that comes through no matter how contentious
the conversation. With Me, My Mother, My Life, Adeniola uncovers
the basic truth of many family arguments: we wouldnt fight so much
if we didnt care so deeply.
