  <title>The Making of a Multiple Sclerosis Patient - S. Doherty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was the thump on the right-hand side of her head that woke author S. Doherty as she gasped for air. She felt as if she had been holding her breath too long. She woke her husband to tell him she had to use the toilet. He said, Well, go. She replied, But, honey, I cant. Im paralyzed. I cant move. Maybe the doctors were right. Maybe I do have the start of multiple sclerosis.
And that began her journey through the labyrinth of medical tests and pointless discussions with doctors who wouldnt listen to anything she said. The final straw came when she was refused rehabilitation because the medical professionals insisted she had multiple sclerosis simply because a machine said so.
In The Making of a Multiple Sclerosis Patient, Doherty shares her story of having suffered a massive stroke, yet doctors insisted she had a case of extreme multiple sclerosis even though she didnt exhibit any symptoms of the disease. This memoir shares her fifteen-year fight from a wheelchair to prove she doesnt have multiple sclerosis." />
