  <title>Tears on Her Face - Kisha L. Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt like you needed to talk but nobody was there to listen? Poet Kisha Phillips can relate. Her own loneliness is what first inspired her to write poetry. Over the course of her life, there were times when she felt abandoned; her only friends were her notebook and pen. Writing became therapy for her, allowing her to release negativity, never allowing it to fester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tears on Her Face is about Kishas past pains and how she endured. Through forgiveness and self-love, she now smiles more each day. Some of the most difficult times we go throughand eventually conquercan be the most important times in our lives. Kishas poems represent the events of her life, good and bad. Both the good and the bad made her into the strong, dedicated woman she is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her writing, she shares the highs and lows. She has passed through dark times to find light and experience real joy. At times, when we are in the middle of trials, it can be hard to see beyond the bad that is happening in our lives. If we take a step back and be still, the answers to our problems often appear right before our eyes. Be still, embrace the written word, and find the solutions you seek.&lt;/p&gt;" />
