      <meta name="description" content="Whod a thunk it? Becoming a spiritual channel, a medium, an intuitive, and a past life regression facilitator were never on my list of goals to achieve. And yet I did. My story of evolving from normal to multidimensional is one of learning about expanding consciousness, unconditional love, and otherworldly possibilities. It is also a tale of having to confront death, near death, loss, and betrayal while keeping a sense of humor. Discovering that there is a presence, a spirit, a soul, a higher consciousness within each of us that is eternal and all knowing changed me. I went looking for the meaning of death and found immortality. Life is constantly full of surprises." />
