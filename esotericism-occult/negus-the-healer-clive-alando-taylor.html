  <title>Negus the Healer - Clive Alando Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Dr. Carole Buckingham sets off on a holistic quest to investigate and study alternative treatments to apply to modern-day therapies and treatments, her life suddenly takes a dramatic turn as she begins her journey through this world of discovery set against a backdrop of world technology and surveillance, watched over by two operatives by the name of John Socrates and his colleague Jane Pandora, who are coworkers at a commercial organization called Channel Zero. 
Carole soon begins to discover that when she meets a stranger who calls himself Negus, who is someone that she finds also possesses the gift of healing through his own determinate will and faith in having been diagnosed with a rare medical condition. 
It is through this chance meeting that both Carole and Negus begin to form a unique and special bond between them. And yet as their friendship begins to develop and flourish and as they both become ever more drawn closer together in an unpredictable and fragile world where nothing is quite what it seems or appears to be what it is, the unfamiliarity brings Carole and Negus to question their own perceptions of truth as they attempt to challenge their own interpretations of one another until eventually, things begin to come to a positive friendship between them. Suddenly, an unfortunate set of circumstances takes place, which threatens Caroles life, which in turn leaves Negus to attempt to save her while putting his own life at risk." />
