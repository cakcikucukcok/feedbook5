  <title>Tarot in the Spirit of Zen - Osho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest spiritual teachers presents a unique and valuable resource for all students and practitioners of the Tarot.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A must have for owners of the phenomenally popular Osho Zen Tarot, this in-depth study of the meanings of the cards in the Osho Zen Tarot deck will also appeal to those who use the Rider, Crowley, and other, more traditional cards. The &quot;here and now&quot; approach of Zen offers the insight that the future evolves out of present events, ideas, and attitudes. Playful and accessible even to the novice, this remarkable handbook includes a table of correspondences for the Rider-Waite and Crowley cards, and special sections on the meanings of the four major elements, or &quot;suits&quot; in the Tarot system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tarot in the Spirit of Zen&lt;/i&gt; introduces readers to a deeper understanding of the Zen approach to becoming aware of and responding to life&#39;s challenges. Just like the Osho Zen Tarot deck, this book offers a fresh and contemporary approach to anyone who is interested in self-exploration and personal transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; of London as one of the &quot;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mid-Day &lt;/i&gt;(India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
