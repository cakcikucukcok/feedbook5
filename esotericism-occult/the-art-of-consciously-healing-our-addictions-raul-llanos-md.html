  <title>The Art of Consciously Healing Our Addictions - Raul Llanos, Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Within our daily realities, we all face challenges. It is our choice whether we deal with them in a positive or negative way. Unfortunately, some of us turn to addictive behaviors in an attempt to relieve or forget inner-turmoil or painful experiences. By gaining awareness of these unhealthy responses, we can reverse addictive patterns and learn to look within to create happiness and fulfillment.
Raul Llanos, a physician with more than forty years of experience, shares guidance, ideas, concepts, and techniques that will help others achieve a higher stage of consciousness, create a freer reality full of joy, and embrace Gods unconditional love. Dr. Llanos begins by examining who we are, where we are coming from, and where we are going before moving into a deeper reflection on the twelve steps commonly used in addiction rehabilitation. Included are suggestions on how to release long-held addictions through a variety of holistic methods and move into a better place of health and well-being.
The Art of Consciously Healing Our Addictions offers wisdom from a seasoned physician that encourages others to shun addictive behaviors and awaken to a new reality that connects spirituality with self-awareness" />
