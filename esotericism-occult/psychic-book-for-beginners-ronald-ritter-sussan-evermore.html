  <title>Psychic book for beginners - Ronald Ritter, Sussan Evermore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The unseen world exists and communicates to us regularly. Have you ever heard an obscure frequency sound or sensed a weird energy shift where the room suddenly becomes cold?&lt;br /&gt;
If this information is new to you, then please be patient and let me share my findings and experiences to help you connect the dots of the unseen world and our physical third dimensional world. So I will ask: Have you ever experienced tension building in your stomach known as a gut feeling?&lt;br /&gt;
What about seeing something out of the corner of your eye but when you turn to see clearly, it&amp;rsquo;s gone?&lt;br /&gt;
Is there a time when have had a strong emotion to wait and delay leaving? Or get going early? Felt a strong emotion to attend a gathering or avoid it? What about the feeling to call someone immediately for no reason?&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever had bad feelings when meeting someone for the first time? Or had good feelings meeting someone for the first time, as if you have known them your whole life?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you ever hear a high pitch whistling sound when no one else can hear it? Or your name called when you are alone?&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever felt something touch the hair on top of your head, when no one is near?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you ever feel something touch, tickle, stroke or irritate your skin like an insect walking over you but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing there? And it happens more commonly at night when you&amp;rsquo;re in bed.&lt;br /&gt;
Is there a time when you have walked into an old building and felt an unseen presence?&lt;br /&gt;
If so, then you are psychic and experiencing the unseen world that surrounds us.&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone has psychic abilities, as we are all dimensional beings but some of us are more aware of this phenomenon than others. Our world is designed to be fully interactive with life on earth and its surroundings.&lt;br /&gt;
Why do we feel calm and content when walking through a forest or a garden surrounded by flowers? It&amp;rsquo;s the life force coming from these living expressions that we are picking up as we experience a mood change.&lt;br /&gt;
This may sound unusual but all expressions of life on Earth has an energy life force, known as an aura and this is what we feel when close by.&lt;br /&gt;
Communication comes in many forms and other species have languages too. Anyone who has a domestic pet will understand an almost telepathic relationship one can have with a pet. They respond to our moods, which is an energy expression and our voice frequency which communicates our intentions.&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome to a new world of understanding. This book is created to assist those who are searching beyond the daily activities of life and seeking to know more about this world. Developing your psychic senses is about tapping into the world as we see it, but also into a world we cannot see, but we can feel and know it exists.&lt;br /&gt;
