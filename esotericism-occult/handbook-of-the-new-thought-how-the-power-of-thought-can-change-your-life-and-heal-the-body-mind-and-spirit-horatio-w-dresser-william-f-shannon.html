  <title>Handbook of the New Thought: How the Power of Thought Can Change Your Life and Heal the Body, Mind and Spirit - Horatio W. Dresser, William F. Shannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="HANDBOOK OF THE NEW THOUGHT is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the law of attraction, affirmations, meditation, mental healing of the body, and mind treatment.  It is perfect for anyone who wants to change their life in any way.  In clear language this book explains how the power of thought can be used to change your life and heal the body, mind and spirit, and thus eliminate fear, anxiety, worry, nervousness, pessimism and unbelief.  The author explains what New Thought is and how it arose in the 1800s, and gives practical tips for using the ideas in daily life.  The power of the mind is the most important asset each of us has.  It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you are rich or poor, male or female, or where you live or anything else, each person has this great asset &amp;ndash; the power to change their thinking and thus change their life.  Yes, we all find ourselves in particular circumstances that may appear to be holding us back for whatever reason, but we still have the awesome power to decide how to respond to those circumstances with our thoughts and actions.  We can always affect the outcome.  We always have choices.  Often we forget just how much power that fact truly gives us.  Dresser reminds us eloquently in this book, over and over again, just how important it is to remember this truth.  HANDBOOK OF THE NEW THOUGHT has been unavailable in either print or digital form for many years.  This new edition of HANDBOOK OF THE NEW THOUGHT is edited into gender neutral language to make it even more accessible to a 21st century audience." />
