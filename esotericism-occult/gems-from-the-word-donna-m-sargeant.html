  <title>Gems from the Word - Donna M. Sargeant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here is a book that has been needed for a long time. My mother wrote these words during a time in her life when she was raising us two boys to be the men we are today along with being a pastor&#39;s wife. Fast forward to today-she has been deceased for almost 5 years now and the publication of this book couldn&#39;t have come at a better time! You will enjoy her comments on the scripture reading of the day. It is a chronological devotional book of the whole Bible. My mother typed all these words on one of the old Royal typewriters of the day. It&#39;s amazing how good her thoughts were concerning serving her Lord and Master on a daily basis. We can each glean something from the Word and become closer to the Lord after reading what she wrote in her daily devotions. I&#39;m glad to have been a small part in getting this book to print. I&#39;m sure that everyone that buys this devotional book will be as pleased as I was when I went through it in my personal devotions every morning. May the Lord bless all who receive this book with a new appreciation of the Lord we serve." />
