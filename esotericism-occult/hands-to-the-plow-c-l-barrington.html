  <title>Hands to the Plow - C. L. Barrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTIONS are among the most difficult to overcome. While there are treatments that are effective to many, not everyone experiences a positive outcome when using traditional methods. Even so, there is still hope for recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands to the Plow tells of author C L. Barringtons extraordinary experiences in bioenergetics and the metaphysical components of healing. Working as a massage therapist, yoga instructor, and meditation teacher, she used those components to help her clients discover their own Higher Power and prevail over alcohol and drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural, benevolent energy force within the universe brought her knowledge of what techniques and information to pass to patients to ease their pain, discomfort, and anxiety and to stimulate their healing and well-being, or to help them achieve a new level of consciousness. As they learned how the body affects the mind and vice versa, they began to enjoy the stillness of body and soul. They discovered their connection to the divine and answers within themselves to support their sobriety and face other challenges in life with peace and reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands to the Plow encourages us all to touch the spirit of grace and to shine its divine light and energy into the dark caverns of our own souls or into other souls who struggle with addictions or other debilitating issues. These techniques can help you find comfort, hope, and, most of all, healing and renewal.&lt;br /&gt;
