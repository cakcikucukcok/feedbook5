  <title>Fisherman’S Call - William Packer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What would it look like if you gave up your stuff  your fears, conditioning and attachment to human-centered drama, and lived purely from your heart?  Bill Packer, author of Fishermans Call, sold everything and went into the wilderness determined to open his heart and connect with the Creator though the natural world.
Discover Natures Secret and the amazing story of a life lived from the heart connection, with compassion for all living things, and the miracles he has experienced as a result.  You will never see nature the same way again.  This compilation describes Packers personal story of awakening human compassion, but it is also a call to us all to open our hearts to the precious wonder of life all around us and awaken from the slumber of human ignorance. Inspiring, insightful and prophetic, Fishermans Call challenges us to look deeply and question what is most meaningful in life.
Author William Billy Packer shares a series of personal stories, first about the sea, then about stewardship of the earth, drawn from his own experiences. Faced with instances of destruction of the environment, notably of the ancient redwood forests in northern California, Packer began questioning his own cultural conditioningall the things we learn and tend to accept as true from our families and the cultural environment we are exposed to as we grow and mature.
Fishermans Call contains a timely and vital message: the destructive human impact to life on our planet can no longer be ignored. Our very survival may depend on our attention to this fact. No longer can we ignore the fact that the human intellect, devoid of the hearts compassionate wisdom, is destructive and self-serving." />
