  <title>The Gods in Their Cities - Richard Leviton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A fresh look at the perennial reality of the gods and how they help humanity-through the planet&#39;s sacred sites&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The &quot;gods&quot; live! Though seemingly relegated to the archives of myth, the &quot;gods&quot; of antiquity are still with us in the form of the Great White Brotherhood. In fact, what the ancients described as their pantheon are members of this is an august assembly of spiritually advanced beings, based on the constellation of the Great Bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;The Gods in Their Cities&lt;/I&gt;, based on original clairvoyant research, reveals that the Great White Brotherhood has numerous meeting places for humans throughout the planet&#39;s array of holy sites. Seven different Great White Brotherhood types of geomantic locales are documented, and all of them exist in multiple copies on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;The Gods in Their Cities&lt;/I&gt; shows how myths of many cultures, from the Irish to Sumerians, are actually psychic maps to the planet&#39;s secret visionary terrain, to the geomantic locales of the Brotherhood, and how to successfully interact with them. And it probes behind the mythic guises of the Ray Masters, 14 select great Adepts involved with many aspects of Earth life and geomancy since the beginning-including the true identity of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, the Virgin Mary, and Merlin.&lt;/p&gt;
Merely our knowing that this esoteric Brotherhood and their interactive locales across the Earth exist can inspire confidence, even certainty, that reality, and thus our planet, culture, and individual human lives, have meaning and are purposeful." />
