  <title>Keep Moving - Dick Van Dyke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Show-business legend Dick Van Dyke is living proof that life does get better the longer you live it. Who better to offer instruction, advice, and humor than someone who&amp;#39;s entering his ninth decade with a jaunty two-step? Van Dyke isn&amp;#39;t just a born song-and-dance man; his irrepressible belief in embracing the moment and unleashing his inner child has proved to be the ultimate elixir of youth. When he was injured during the filming of &lt;I&gt;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&lt;/I&gt;, his doctor warned him he&amp;#39;d be using a walker within seven years, but Dick performed a soft shoe right there and never looked back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Keep Moving&lt;/I&gt;, Dick Van Dyke offers his own playful anecdotes and advice, as well as insights from his brother, actor Jerry Van Dyke; his friend and creator of &lt;I&gt;The Dick Van Dyke Show&lt;/I&gt;, Carl Reiner; and other spirited friends and family. Whether he&amp;#39;s describing the pleasure he takes in his habitual visits to the grocery store; how he met his late-in-life-love Arlene; or how he sprung back, livelier than ever, from a near-death experience, Dick&amp;#39;s optimistic outlook is an invigorating tonic for anyone who needs a reminder that life should be lived with enthusiasm despite what the calendar says.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;You don&amp;#39;t have to act your age. You don&amp;#39;t even have to feel it. And if it does attempt to elbow its way into your life, you do not have to pay attention. If I am out shopping and hear music playing in a store, I start to dance. If I want to sing, I sing. I read books and get excited about new ideas. I enjoy myself. I don&amp;#39;t think about the way I am supposed to act at my age &amp;#150; or at any age. As far as I know, there is no manual for old age. There is no test you have to pass. There is no way you have to behave. There is no such thing as &amp;#145;age appropriate.&amp;#39;&lt;br&gt;When people ask my secret to staying youthful at an age when getting up and down from your chair on your own is considered an accomplishment, you know what I tell them?&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#145;Keep moving.&amp;#39;&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#150; Dick Van Dyke&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
