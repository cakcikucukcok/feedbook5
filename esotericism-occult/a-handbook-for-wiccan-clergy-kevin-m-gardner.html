  <title>A Handbook for Wiccan Clergy - Kevin M. Gardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-indent: 0.5in;&quot;&gt;This is THE handbook for Clergy of
the Wiccan faith. Additionally, this work would also prove to be a great aid to
all other Pagan paths. There is currently no other book of this sort on the
market. With Handfasting, and funeral services, guided meditations and
spiritual messages this book will be used again and again. A Handbook For
Wiccan Clergy&quot; is a valuable tool for all High Priests and High
Priestesses of whatever tradition to have and utilize. Far from being a Wiccan
101, or &quot;spell&quot; book, this work is only intended for advanced
practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-indent: 0.5in;&quot;&gt;&quot;A Handbook For Wiccan
Clergy,&quot; continues to pull in rave reviews, HealingWolf of FaDraSha has
said; &quot;This is a &quot;must have&quot; book for more advanced witches. If
you ever counsel others or act as high priest(ess), you&#39;ll want this great
reference book.&quot; Edain McCoy has also read this work and has proclaimed it
as &quot;Wonderful&quot; and It is well past time that a book of this type
should be available. Serpent Stone said; &quot;This book is a wonderful guide
for both new and experienced Priests and Priestesses, and covers areas as
varied as Rites of Passage, mythology (including techniques and rituals for
connecting with the ideas, teaching and energies of the myth), meditations,
personal growth and awareness, and pastoral counseling. All of these are areas
that have been sadly lacking in any comprehensive volume before this, but which
are essential to working effectively as clergy.&quot; And most recently from
Marlevane&#39;s Book Reviews This book gets right down to business. Kevin (Temple
of Ishtar) writes this book geared towards rituals for performing all rites of
passages. No Wiccan Priest or Priestess should be without this book in their
collections! This book is a real gem to the Pagan world and to all magickal
practitioners.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
