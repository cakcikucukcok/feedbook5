  <title>The Geomantic Year - Richard Leviton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The spiritual world blesses the Earth at least 58 times a year-here&#39;s how you can join the party.&lt;/p&gt;
Do you think folklore customs about solstices and equinoxes and other regular celebration days are quaint holdovers from the past? Not so. Do you sometimes wish there were a way to include the entire planet in a meditation practice?&lt;/p&gt;
There is, and it&#39;s called the geomantic year. At least 58 times a year the spiritual world-angels, archangels, Ascended Masters, Star-Angels, even the Supreme Being-tunes in to the Earth, blesses, and even heals it in real-time day-long events. Our planet is constantly receiving input from the cosmos and heavenly realms. It&#39;s all part of a rhythmic maintenance calendar in which the Earth is enlivened, and all of humanity is invited to participate. This book shows you how.&lt;/p&gt;
What kinds of events? On Epiphany, January 6, the Christ focuses on the planet to birth his Light. On Bifrost Paints the Planet, April 10, the Great Bear constellation envelopes the Earth in 14 rays of light. On Michaelmas, September 29, the Archangel Michael cleanses the Earth&#39;s sacred sites and all their &quot;plumbing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
Other events in the geomantic year involve stars, Nature Spirits, holy mountains, River-gods, Pleiadians, Hollow Earth dwellers, Grail Kings, volcano spirits, the Great Mother, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;The Geomantic Year&lt;/I&gt; documents 58 festival dates that focus on the Earth through its sacred sites, and it provides 58 simple meditations to help you participate. And it offers 12 informative essays linking Earth energies with hot topics such as the Illuminati and world control, parallel universes, the world&#39;s gold supply, the Ghost Dance, the Fall of Man, Earth and climate changes, and the apocalyptic year 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
Why not get out your appointment book and pencil in a few dates: the Earth&#39;s expecting you!&lt;/p&gt;" />
