  <title>Edgar Cayce on the Mysterious Essenes: Lessons from Our Sacred Past - John Van Auken, Ruben Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the most fascinating topics found in the readings of famed psychic Edgar Cayce (1877-1945) revealed the existence of a sacred sect called the Essenes. His information about the Essenes would later be confirmed by the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls two years after his death. Cayce&#39;s readings contained more than a description of who the Essenes were and their purpose in bringing the Christ into the earth, he gave us details about their lives and past lives! Many of these Essenes reincarnated during Cayce&#39;s time and received readings that revealed their souls-including their purposes then and now. What can we learn from these readings and the reincarnation of the Essenes? There is so much about our origin, our soul group, and the purpose for which we are here on earth today in this latest book that it is like having a manual for soul growth. Ideals, practices, and guiding principles held by these ancient ones are as valuable to us today as they were then." />
