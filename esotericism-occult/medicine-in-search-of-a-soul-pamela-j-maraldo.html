  <title>Medicine: in Search of a Soul - Pamela J. Maraldo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We are taught that external conditions or people are to blame for our illnesses and pain. While other people and situations can affect the quality of your energy field---it is within your power to train your mind and emotions, and adapt your inner feelings, to let go of whatever is hurting you.
Essentially, all you have to do is raise the frequency of your energy field. You are---we all are---an energetic reflection of your own attitudes and feelings.
Whatever you focus on is brought to life. Our brains are holographic, living in a holographic universe. Our physical world is made solid by our senses, as if you put on 3-D glasses. New scientific studies tell us that the observation of a particle is what makes it solid. The tangible is born of the intangible: our thoughts, attitudes and feelings, as well as our physical bodies, are a reflection of the quality of our energies, our vibrational resonance....our consciousness.
There is nothing that cant be healed, if you can change your frame of mind, and the way you feel." />
