  <title>A Brave, True Story: A Transformational Memoir about Healing Family Ties and Relationships - Natalie Jovanic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Brave, True Story is a heartfelt and inspiring memoir that reveals how it is possible to heal from a painful past and live with passion, purpose and fulfillment. It provides an insightful exploration into the world of relationships, emotions and recovering from dark experiences of the past. Natalie Jovanic is a successful relationship coach and trainer, but her past hasn&#39;t always been so rosy. As a young child, she was not supported or protected and as a result, grew into a woman who, in her own words, &#39;had abandoned herself&#39;. She entered into unhealthy relationships that she considered to be normal and didn&#39;t expect anything better. Then, a trip to Thailand opened her eyes about the negativity of her relationships and she began to follow her inner voice. By recognizing the destructive patterns, Natalie cleared them out through different healing methods and replaced them with healthy ones. This empowers her to say &quot;no&quot; to unhealthy relationships and changed the course of her life into fulfillment. She recovered her deep love for herself and was finally able to put painful emotions from the past to rest, for good. The memoir is delicately built around reconstructed dialogue and incidents. Natalie successfully recreates her inner monologues and gives clear images about her inner process. &#39;A Brave True Story&#39; is Natalie&#39;s deeply personal account of her journey from the darkness of her past to her current life, which is full of happiness, hope and possibilities. It is the story of a woman who dreamed of being healed and whole - and she triumphed.   Reviews: &quot;This true and inspiring story of sadness and joy, disappointment and happiness, will touch your heart and help you to release your full potential for living.&quot; Brain Tracy, Author of &#39;No Excuses&#39;   &quot;[A] delicate memoir about a woman&#39;s path to healing the darkness of violence and suffering....[The author&#39;s] utter simplicity and directness-her impeccable inner child&#39;s innocence-win our trust...as she shines her gentle steady light through the scary woods to open roads and unexpected opportunity.&quot; R.
