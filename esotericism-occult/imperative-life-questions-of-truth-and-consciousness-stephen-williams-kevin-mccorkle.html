  <title>Imperative Life Questions of Truth and Consciousness - Stephen Williams, Kevin McCorkle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In each of our experiences, we come into this realm of being with a very limited remembrance or consciousness of the reality of who and what we truly are, both on an individual and collective basis. We are thrust, headlong into a world full of other beings that suffer from this same truth amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, we start the journey of our true self remembrance. A journey of our own creation, of life experience divinely designed to lead us back to the home that we only believed we left. Back, to the internal knowing of our connection to all of life. All of creation, that collectively make up this creative force from which we are fooled into believing we are separate fromthat which we call God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey of creation. The journey that is ever changingbut never ending.&lt;/p&gt;" />
