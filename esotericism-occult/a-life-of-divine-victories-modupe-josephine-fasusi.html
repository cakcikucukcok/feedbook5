  <title>A Life of Divine Victories - Modupe Josephine Fasusi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I was going through some bizarre experiences and experiencing sustained witchcraft attacks for about forty-two years. I was not prepared for these bizarre encounters and so didnt understand what was happening. I only felt the pain, hurt, and social ostracism associated with the attacks. God took over my battles; He taught me how to pray in warfare, sustained me in the trial, took over my battles, and uplifted me in sustained victories. The world must hear my story and know that God is alive, the same yesterday, today, and forever, so that someone else somewhere, going through similar unexplained problems would find succor and solutions to their problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these experiences, I explored the linkages of such attacks to the better understanding, management, and treatment of mental health and behavioral problems of today, and the respective roles for churches, parents and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
