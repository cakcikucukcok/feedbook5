  <title>Whose Church Is It Anyway? - Peter Una</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whose Church is it Anyway?
A laymans perspective on popular church teachings and practices and their impact on revival in black majority churches
This book looks at the role recent and emerging Biblical teachings have in shaping the church as it moves forward in its role as the Bride of Christ. It also sheds some insight into revival. How they come about, the qualities of the people God uses to bring revival to a nation and the impact of revival in our lives, the church and community.
Whose Church is it Anyway boldly addresses several issues that the average Christian shies away from, in particular, obedience to God and motives for doing what we do. This book has been written for both lay members and church leaders in a none threatening friendly way and is easy to read. It will challenge and inspire you as you read through its pages.
Pastor Roland Henshaw  Word of Life Church, London, England
I picked up this book to read and could not put it down. Peter Una has written straight from his heart with passion, fervour and deep cutting honesty. The contents of these pages will challenge your life and drive you to your knees. The truth outlined here will annoy church-goers but bless followers of Jesus Christ. This compelling book will help you build Gods Kingdom, de-clutter for destiny and stand ready for eternity.
