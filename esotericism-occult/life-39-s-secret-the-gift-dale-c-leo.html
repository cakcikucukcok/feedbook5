  <title>Life&#39;s Secret, the Gift - Dale C. Leo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;Connecting Power in Mind/ Body/ Spirit
p&gt; The true nature of your being, is the Gift, from within your good soul, your good spirit, connecting with your good thoughts. You will find that with this connection it will deny you nothing and gives you everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Gift within you that rests at the center of your being, and connects with the Light from the Infinite Power of the universe, little else matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you discover to know of the true power that lies within, nothing is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Gift of Light ( your spirit and soul ) connects with the Light of the Universe, you will hear to believe there are no limits. There is no obstacle to strong for you to overcome, no disease your thought cannot delete, no situation that cannot be changed, no connecting relationship that cannot be found, no desire that cannot be made to manifest and come true. Know that the connecting powers are within you. All things are possible when you see with the inner vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wisdom is shared in the voice of vision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The belief of knowing all is true awaits the eyes that see. It teaches that while physically being bound to earth, there is within us a spiritual power, a power of self, though which we are one connecting with the universe, it teaches to have focus, listen to the mind, and we will find our happiness. Making a connection, the vision will come with the narration, sharing the wisdom to perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person on our earth has the gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with knowledge and understanding, the Whispered Words of Wisdom will lead you to more wisdom, and you will then see what you could not see before.&lt;/p&gt;
From our Ancient Past; certain words in phrases were written in code, we say and use these phrases without knowing the true meaning behind them:
You Will &quot;find out&quot;
When You &quot;open up your gift&quot;
It Came To You &quot;just out of the blue&quot;
You Were &quot;walking tall, with your head up in the sky&quot;
You Said &quot;it&#39;s right on the money&quot;
&quot;Remember what comes to you in the Whispering Words of Wisdom; you will hear the answers. It is then to recognize the opportunities that become present&quot;" />
