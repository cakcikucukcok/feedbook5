  <title>Our Grand Journey of Self-Exploration - Tara O&#39;Toole-Conn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our Grand Journey of Self-Exploration opens the door to connecting with your spirit truth. Whether this is your first journey of the soul or not, you will transform your thoughts about communicating through life, soul-to-soul, regardless of whether the soul is in the physical or in the spiritual realm. We all have a direct connection with the divine, and we can consciously choose to identify with the soul self of others before seeing the physical self. In seeing the soul self of others, you will be able to lovingly communicate their desires and fears with loving support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a time in history that is saying its time to appreciate the soulful connection we have to our loved ones in spirit. That is where we are as a collective, you know. Were at that juncture in the human history where it is time to let go of the fear of the unknown, of the fear of death, the fear and uncertainty of what exists beyond this physical world that we cant see with our physical eyes. By the soul of Peter D. Conn.&lt;/p&gt;" />
