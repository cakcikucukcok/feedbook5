  <title>Women, Rice and Beans: Ten Wisdoms of a Brazilian Mother for Daily Easy Flow and Conscious Living - Ana Barreto, Pablo Chaves, Sarah Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Throughout history and cultures, women too often are overwhelmed with raising a family, working long hours, helping in the community, cooking the meals, and doing the housework. Putting everyone and everything before ourselves is something we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from our mothers. But balance, happiness, and peace are possible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this inspirational self-help guide, Brazilian personal development teacher Ana Barreto shows readers how to achieve serenity. She shares her experiences of spending her childhood in Brazil before coming to the United States and then traveling back to her home country to care for her ailing mother.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bonding with her elderly mother made Ana reflect on her life and the lives of many women. She came up with ten wisdoms&amp;mdash;or affirmations&amp;mdash;that she shares in her book. The book provides simple exercises for taking care of yourself, meditating, carving out personal space, and reaching for your dreams. She also guides you on using feng shui, Buddhism, and even principles of quantum physics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It will lift you up and give you the courage to reach for what you want in life&amp;mdash;staying calm while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
