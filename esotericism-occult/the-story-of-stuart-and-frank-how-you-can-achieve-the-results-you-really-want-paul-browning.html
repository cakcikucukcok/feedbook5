  <title>The Story of Stuart and Frank: How You Can Achieve the Results You Really Want - Paul Browning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Story of Stuart and Frank is a book written by the author, Paul Browning, with the intent of delivering to the reader instructions on how to get the results that they really want in their life. Factors such as the increasing cost of living, jobs under threat or cash flow pressures in business means we all concentrate on a lot of negativity in our lives. Consequently, such negativity can wear us down and affect our thoughts, feelings, attitudes and ultimately our results and achievements. You may have noticed this negativity filtering down to affect you at a personal level. You may have experienced this in the form of feedback from employers, teachers, even mothers and fathers whom despite having your best interests at heart can occasionally fail to encourage. Let s not forget, they too are under pressure. The Story of Stuart and Frank, outlines the lives of two fictional individuals who have the same opportunities as they embark on their lives. It depicts two very contrasting outcomes for them both despite their similar circumstances. Stuart does very well while Frank achieves modest results at best. Browning uses these two individuals to outline to us how our thoughts become feelings, the way feelings influence our actions, and our actions dictate the quality of our results. The book outlines the factors that can influence our thoughts and provides suggestions for success. The book contains two parts. Part One details the lives of Stuart and Frank and analyses how their lives change through the lifecycle of growing up to old age and, ultimately, death whilst concentrating on the internal and external factors that influence their thoughts and actions. Part Two outlines how the reader can get the results they really want in any aspect of their own life. It analyses how we all think, how we use our five physical senses to perceive the world we live in and finally what we can do to influence the way we think. Consequently, the reader can enjoy a happier and better quality of life from the results they achieve." />
