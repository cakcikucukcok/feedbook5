  <title>Spiritual Archaeology - Ronald Ritter &amp; Sussan Evermore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spiritual Archaeology is a way of exploring the unseen past through a psychic connection. Sussan is the conduit who connects to Osiris, creator God of Egypt and Atlantis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The original temple of Osiris the Osireion is located in Abydos Egypt. Without logical explanation, an image is incised on a marble column with three circular images known collectively as the Flower of Life. Osiris speaks through the host of the secrets of the design and the connection to Atlantis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also we unravel a mystery in a small hilltop town in Italy, where the name of Merlini is recorded on the village register in the year 1150AD. He mentors a desperate knight Sir Gal-garno Guidotti who plunges a sword into solid rock. We discover what the Merlin Energy has meant to humanity throughout the ages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Situated a short distance from Rome is Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa - one of the wonders of the ancient world and within its boundaries we find a definitive link to Atlantis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ancient city of Pompeii was destroyed by volcano in 79AD. In a garden we stumble across a seemingly inconspicuous fountain that will change recorded history and the discovery of Mexico. This unique find will also prove a connection between the Etruscans and the Mayan empire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We make contact with Voltumna, the supreme Etruscan Goddess to find the location of the holy grail of Italian archaeology, the Fanum Voltumnae. The location in central Italy is one of the most important finds for the spiritual center of the Etruscan world." />
