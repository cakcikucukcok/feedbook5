  <title>Jesus Was a Vampire - E. Val Lynn&#39;Doll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is based upon one womans journey through insanity, after she stumbles on the belief that she is Christ.  All accounts are true and based on actual events.
	They call her Jezabel and she is not your average entertainer.  She is a punk-rock, anarchist who is set on taking over the world, (through the use of art and creativity,) in order to sustain the life of this planet.  Known for her amazing acrobatic-skill on the pole, she uses her talent to entice her victims into understanding the greater good ...which sometimes comes across as the greater evil.  With thoughts rooted around the idea that God and Satan are the same being, a genie that disguised itself, Jezabel offers him her soul for the purpose of &#39;true love&#39;.
Now shes riding shotgun, on a one-way mission that she has no control over.  Her mind is thrown into a state of chaos, as she encounters her fears, and tries to grasp what is left of reality.  Pushing the limits of understanding, she is bound by her honor to embrace every opportunity that presents itself before her, in an attempt to invoke what might be our only chance for survival." />
