  <title>Positive Energy - Ping Leeka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Positive Energy: Illuminate Unlimited Energy will take you deep into the three important meanings in your whole life. The first is your BaZi DNA. BaZi means you will know what will happen in your life because its already been chosen for you. All this is based from God; we cant change it, neither will natural human influentials. Reading and understanding the content contained in these pages will help you in balancing out your energies and the worlds energies around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is about your luck which is based on your Zodiac Fortune. This is basic from the month and year you were born. Asia has over 6,000 years knowledge on this information already. The information is followed by the moon, stars, and the sun. Weve used that information since 2006. This also means this does not only work on just Asian people, but also everyone else as well. This is about knowledge only and not based on religion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third is Feng Shui. Feng Shui mostly has to do with the inside and outside energy of the house. You want to try to have positive energy in your house so you can have positive results. The book details with examples of house positions. When you have a positive house, your life situations change. Your money gets better, your relationship will grow, youll be feeling better at work, and the arguments will ease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the three steps you should follow to improve your life. Positive Energy: Illuminate Unlimited Energy will provide a step-by-step guide. If you succeed on the first and second steps, you will know who we are and how to help yourself and your loved ones.. As humans we are like a big tree, the first and second steps are like the trees roots. The third step is giving a vitamin to the tree. So if you want to live prosperously, we have to fix the roots first not just fill ourselves with nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;" />
