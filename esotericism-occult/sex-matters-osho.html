  <title>Sex Matters - Osho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the greatest spiritual thinkers of the twentieth century explores the physical and emotional intimacies of men and women in &lt;i&gt;Sex Matters: Sex to Superconsciousness&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sex matters to us all. The Osho approach to sex begins with an understanding of how important love is in our lives, while at the same time acknowledges that the journey into love cannot exclude our innate biological energies. With this perspective, it becomes clear that the tendency for religions, and for society in general, to associate sex with sin and morality has been a great misfortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sex Matters&lt;/i&gt; begins by deconstructing the layers of sexual repression that the condemnation of sex has inflicted on humans. Throughout the book--in response to questions about everything from jealousy to premature ejaculation, the role of intimacy and the differences between men and women--Osho proposes a vision that embraces sex as a fundamental gift from nature. We learn how orgasm offers a glimpse of timelessness, thoughtlessness, and pure awareness--biology&#39;s way of pointing toward the consciousness that helps us to understand ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we are presented with a clear choice: a repressed sexuality that leads to pornography, perversion, and a stunted humanity or a playful, respectful, and relaxed innocence that supports us in becoming fulfilled and whole, as nature intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; of London as one of the &quot;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mid-Day &lt;/i&gt;(India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
