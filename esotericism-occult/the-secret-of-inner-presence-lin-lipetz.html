  <title>The Secret of Inner Presence - Lin Lipetz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Secret of Inner Presence begins with author Lin Lipetzs story of her spontaneous spiritual awakening in 1986. This amazing and unexpected event created an immediate awareness of a loving Inner Presence within her heart and a connection to another higher level of peace, contentment, and greater knowledge. She now knows that Inner Presence waits patiently to manifest within each person, and much of The Secret of Inner Presence is about providing the keys to bring about that shift in consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As each of the eleven keys is practiced and experienced, the transformation toward a more complete understanding of the core-self will gradually evolve through the loving guidance of the conscious Universe. One of the eleven keys opens the way to intuitively listen to the many voices that will assist in this transformation  through healing, new insights, dreams, problem solving, and caring advice. Another key opens the way to deepen intuitively to the level of receiving messages from the Universe and possibly finding the guides that have been available since birth. This process is called Stream of Consciousness writing, and the powerful dialogues and inspirational poems the author has received in this way for many years are found in each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter by chapter, each of the eleven keys is presented, by both the spiritual Universe and the author, to help guide the reader to a higher dimension of the self.&lt;/p&gt;" />
