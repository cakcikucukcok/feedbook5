  <title>And Satan Entered into Him - Ted Theodore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve Luke 22:3
Have you ever wondered why and how Satan was able to enter into the heart of Judas, even for someone who was a disciple of Jesus, one who was chosen personally by Jesus? I am almost certain that somewhere in your heart and in your thinking, it would be inconceivable for this to happen to you. I mean how could anyone, including your dear lovely (the term dear lovely seems superfluous) self, being so close to the Master, cry when you worship, give all that you have, observe and partake in His miracles, observe His goodness and mercy, partake in His love and kindness, know that He was the Son of the living God and still allow Satan to enter your heart? Maybe, I could fall for Satan trying to put thoughts in my head and heart, but for him to enter into my heart? I can imagine you exclaiming... No way!! 
Just to be sure, Judas was a believer, specially selected as a disciple until this happened!!
John 14:30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.
How could Satan enter into the believers heart? If he does, can he find anything of his in your heart?
How do we keep him out?
Come with me let us explore this together." />
