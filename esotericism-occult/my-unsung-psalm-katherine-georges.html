  <title>My Unsung Psalm - Katherine Georges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;My Unsung Psalm&lt;/i&gt; begins with an invitation for you to experience
seeing God for the first time and becoming part of the journey
through Katherine&#39;s eyes of faith. Through a difficult childhood and a
challenging medical history, she knows God is with her, and she is
never afraid. It is a rare account of Katherine&#39;s feeling of being loved
by God and being useful to mankind. She sees beyond her limitations
and inspires others to never give up.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Sometimes hope can level the playing field of life. We have a chance. We
are offered the opportunity to make something of our lives, and that is
what I did.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&quot;The message of &lt;i&gt;My Unsung Psalm&lt;/i&gt; embraces the essence of the
water of childhood memories becoming the wine of adult faith. You,
the reader, can walk this journey of sadness and joy, and understand
God&#39;s grace vividly as you turn each page of miracles, intertwining
Katherine&#39;s circumstances with your own memories. Cherish God&#39;s
message. Reflect upon this book. Consider the story as a foundation
of faith and healing.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
- Judy McClure&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Anyone in the ministry or entering the seminary should read this
book.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
-Mary Bain Pearson&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;This is Katherine&#39;s story; her journey. A journey that begins with
God holding her hand and ends with Katherine holding God&#39;s
hand. It is not about the storms of her life, but rather, about the
One who sailed the storms beside her. Her journey will lead you to
yours and fill you with Hope! God&#39;s Song is love.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
-Rev. Edward Abell&lt;p&gt;
&quot;She writes as beautifully as she paints.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
