  <title>Healing the Present from the Past - Heather S. Friedman Rivera R.N. J.D Ph.D</title>

Her experience, as well as reports from over 200 respondents from around the world, validate the spiritual, psychological, and physical healings that can result. She reveals her personal journey and the scientific findings from her past life study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her research is now:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt; quantifying the type and degree of healing effects from past life experiences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt; uncovering the factors that drive and influence these effects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt; opening the door for more research in this important healing modality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt; helping bridge gaps between Western medicine and complementary care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
