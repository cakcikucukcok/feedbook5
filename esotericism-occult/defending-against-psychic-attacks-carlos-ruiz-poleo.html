  <title>Defending Against Psychic Attacks - Carlos Ruiz Poleo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Back Cover excerpt	
	Thousands of books have been written about happiness and how to achieve it but these do not consider outer influences from other humans in our life. Of course, all of us would like to be happy and without problems. But many of us have had bad experiences or some sort of problems in our daily life without them having a logical cause or a possible explanation. Some things did not go as expected despite all of our efforts. We are sometimes victims of unforeseen accidents. We sometimes are also unable to reach our foreseen immediate goals which previously were considered very simple even though we were fighting hard to achieve them.	
	We do not know why these events occur but most people attribute it to a possible bad luck at the time or something which was meant to be. A second group either by superstition, or rightly sustained, attribute them to a third partys influence that is considered as an evil-eyed person or bird of ill omen. A third smaller group attributes causes to premeditated attacks from witches or sorcerers and to have been the target of curses or spells.
	Negative intentions that could be either normal or enhanced are what we call psychic attacks. My idea is to give orientation on something undeniable that exists although is blindly rejected by many. Superstitions and myths are analyzed into a logical, rational and partly scientific framework.
	There are strong cultural differences between people from the western hemisphere and those from the orient, and even between people that speak a common language but are separated by geographical or political boundaries. But when common human reactions and events are observed in several different environments, this makes us think that certain truth should be something underlying as the origin and outcomes of those events." />
