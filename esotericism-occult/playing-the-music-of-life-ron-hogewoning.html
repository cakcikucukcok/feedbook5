  <title>Playing the Music of Life - Ron Hogewoning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This book is intended only to be a stepping-stone for a more serious pursuit to one&#39;s own life journey. I believe it holds a key to a barrier that has kept many searching souls held hostage. I also believe it contains the necessary spiritual understanding needed to find the higher concepts that contribute to the building of a better civilization; one that says, &quot;Love one another and live in harmony with all living things.
&lt;P&gt;I have come to know that true happiness comes through living a balanced life, physically, mentally and spiritually. Most of us have a good understanding of the first two, but still do not realize true happiness because we lack spiritual growth. Spiritual growth will lead you from the bondage of fear to  the liberty of love.
&lt;P&gt;Originally this manuscript was written with the sole purpose of sharing what I have come to firmly believe with my grown children and grandchildren. It was only through their encouragement and insistence that this book be shared with others and not kept for them alone.
