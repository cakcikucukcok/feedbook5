  <title>But God - Cheryl David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The bible tells us that faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things unseen. However, as believers when faced with adverse circumstances, we waiver in faith during the waiting period and although we wont readily admit it, we doubt Gods ability to step in and change what seems impossible to possible. Scripture reminds us that God is the ultimate supreme ruler. We have evidence, scriptural, personal and otherwise where indeed He has made a way where there previously seemed to be only obstacles, barriers and mountains. But yet when going through periods of adversity, testing or challenge, we forget. We cave in under the pressures and like Peter we begin to sink. Peter defied laws of gravity and successfully walked on water for the time when his eyes were completed fixed on Jesus. The moment he looked down at the reality of his circumstances, he began to experience natural (rather than spiritual) results and sank.
This book is a reminder that in spite of what we are going through our eyes are to remain fixed on our God. There are real people who have been healed of all types of terminal diseases. There are marriages that were considered irreparable which have been restored, women who were diagnosed as being barren have gone on to bear healthy children and there are children who were labeled as educable mentally retarded who have grown up to achieve and succeed academically and otherwise.
Does your situation seem hopeless? Are you about to give up on your children, marriage or search for a job? Who has the final say? Is it man, is it your circumstance or is it God? Man may make a negative proclamation, diagnosis or declaration, but God is able to deliver positive, favorable and rewarding results." />
