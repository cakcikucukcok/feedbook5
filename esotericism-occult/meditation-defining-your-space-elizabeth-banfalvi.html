  <title>Meditation, Defining Your Space - Elizabeth Banfalvi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The practice of meditation is very fulfilling and can be enhanced by using different, what I call, helpers. They help us keep our meditation practice alive, active, and enlivened. Our lives change constantly, and our meditations are able to mirror these changes. Celebrate often and learn to honour these victories. At other times, we go through low pointsthrough loss or dramatic changesand these helpers can help add an encouragement or healing aspect. Whatever the reason, Defining Your Space contains information concerning many different aspects which help us attain what we need or aspire to. &lt;br /&gt;
Learn about themes, ceremonies, and rituals. These familiar practices can help keep us coming back often. The more we learn, the better our practice.&lt;br /&gt;
Crystals, tarot cards, numerology, colours, and candles add dimension. Astrological elements, time, and directions help us define or change our course. Scents, music, colours, and our senses help guide us to enliven our sensations. Incorporating nature is so important to help keep us grounded and to appreciate what is there for us on this beautiful planet. Whether it is symbology or our senses, incorporating different aspects can help us make life changes. &lt;br /&gt;
Use Defining Your Space to help you discover and enjoy many different ways to transform your practice. It is the difference between a simple and a more enhanced practice. Even simplicity can be enhanced." />
