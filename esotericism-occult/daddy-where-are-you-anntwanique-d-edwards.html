  <title>Daddy, Where Are You? - Anntwanique D. Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Daddy, where are you?
She cried, Daddy, Where Are You? Trapped in a maze, trying to escape the feelings of a hurting girls bondage, a daughter constantly hits roadblocks. Her pain negatively impacts her identity and relationships. Could she be lost because of a father that left her alone? Maybe he didnt notice her stuck in a corner or understand her need for guidance. Either way, there is no cry like that of a daughter who is lost because her father is missing!
In a non-fiction portrayal of the search for her fathers love, Dr. Anntwanique Edwards candidly expresses how her quest could not be satisfied by man. She openly describes her disappointment with her biological and heavenly fathers for not attending to her needs. Her Life experiences are divulged to reveal the purpose of pain. This phenomenal speaker puts her words on a paper to establish Gods ability to release women from the catastrophic danger of dancing with versions of love created by this world. Hear her words, declare the affirmations she shares at the end of each chapter, and experience freedom as never before." />
