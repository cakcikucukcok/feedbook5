  <title>Blooming into Consciousness - Lynn Hooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The final chapter in human life is recognising there is no end. You will keep transforming and remoulding and changing into various forms in multidimensional lives. You will not cease to be. Your exit of thought trails will lead you to another great adventure once the cloak of death has been revealed as a falsehood.
Do not look back but forward into present understanding. You are the master who has come into physical existence to purvey the human form. You have become hidden under the illusion that the earths destination is the final resting place. It is but an illusionary device to make you search for meaning and purpose in your existence to further know yourself.
Once you have mastered the physical, you shall inherit the earth. Look only to conscious evolution as a means to further adventures of the soul. It is a glorious playground in the universe, one that you have become adept at moving in if you did but know it. So to our final words, you are not of this world of human form but you are a part of it. 
Your soul has a great game plan that is far reaching and is calling you to wake up and join in the fun. Blooming into consciousness, the evolution of your soul is a magnificent, glorious adventure; I hope you will join us there.
Namaste." />
