  <title>The Healing Field - Peter Mark Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;THE HEALING FIELD examines remarkable cases of healing and personal transformation made possible by a range of natural energy based healing techniques. The anomalous experiences arising in these contexts throw fresh light on the timeless issues of the nature of consciousness, reality and selfhood.&lt;br /&gt;
Through the unique lens of the energy healer we are able to discern a far more expansive, positive and empowering view of our place within the larger web of life. The experiences recorded in The Healing Field are based upon live cases derived from over 15 years of professional experience. The insight and understanding arising from peoples lived experience goes far to relieving the anxiety, fear and doubt that otherwise overshadows the vast majority of people.&lt;br /&gt;
Back Cover Text:&lt;br /&gt;
The Healing Field presents a collection of real-life cases drawn from intensive energy healing work. For over 15 years, Peter and his wife Gulcan have been practicing and teaching energy psychology methods such as Emotional Freedom Techniques, Tapas Acupressure Technique, Reiki and breathwork to thousands of people. Their research reinforces the idea of a healing and morally self-correcting field of consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;
This concept is compatible with Rupert Sheldrakes Morphic Field. The Healing Field illustrates how transpersonal fields of consciousness connect all life forms and provides powerful leverage to heal the vast range of issues not addressed by conventional medicine and therapy.&lt;br /&gt;
These issues often relate to:&lt;br /&gt;
 Contracts made in the womb&lt;br /&gt;
 Merged identities&lt;br /&gt;
 Problems inherited from ancestors&lt;br /&gt;
 Past life traumas&lt;br /&gt;
 Near death experiences&lt;br /&gt;
 Interactions with deceased persons&lt;br /&gt;
 Spirit and entity attachment&lt;br /&gt;
 Spiritual experiences&lt;br /&gt;
 Encounters with higher order beings&lt;br /&gt;
Each section carefully references scientific research, making this book a unique bridge between science and energy healing. Using simple, natural techniques we can heal our emotional and physical issues. In doing so, we contribute towards healing the fields of consciousness that connect us all. The Healing Field provides a reliable roadmap to help you chart a new course towards realizing your full potential in life.&lt;br /&gt;
