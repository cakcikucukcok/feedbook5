Although the journey is not fun, it is also &lt;strong&gt;not necessarily an experience of severe suffering&lt;/strong&gt;. The writings are spiritual but not overtly religious in nature - but also do not ignore the possibility of using ones&amp;#39; religious inspirations to help if that is part of the reader&amp;#39;s life. By reading the stories, a &lt;strong&gt;woman newly diagnosed with breast cancer can find her way through&lt;/strong&gt;, with others as loving companions. &amp;nbsp;Those who have been through cancer will see their cancer differently by reading these stories. &amp;nbsp;The stories are &lt;strong&gt;attractively accompanied by the author&amp;#39;s art and poetry&lt;/strong&gt; created while traveling through breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There were an estimated 297,000 new cases of breast can or carcinoma in situ in 2013 - the year of the author&amp;#39;s breast cancer.
