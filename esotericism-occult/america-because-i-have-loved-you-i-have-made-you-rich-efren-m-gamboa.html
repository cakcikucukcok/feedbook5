  <title>&quot;America&quot; Because I Have Loved You, I Have Made You Rich! - Efren M. Gamboa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="About my latest book, America Because I have loved you, I have made you rich! The inevitable truth of America, Bible Prophecy, and 666
Author Efren M. Gamboa offers his own conclusions in six chapters. Each chapter promises a resolution to some of the most burning questions of biblical history.
From Noah: I will discuss the three races of the world and will demonstrate to you what race you and your ancestors come from. Where Are the Sons of Abraham?: In this chapter I will discuss where are the sons of Abraham and will locate them for you. The Israelite Exiles: This chapter will show the locations of exiles of Israel from the time of King Solomon to 70 AD and to the present. Blessings and Curses that follow the Children of Israel: This chapter deals with the blessings and curses that follow the children of Israel. Enemies of Man: This chapter gives details of who are the enemies of man and will reveal them; and what to do to survive the life ending attacks of the enemies of life. The reason for the destruction foreseen of the year 2012 will be given and revealed. Is Jesus the Promise Christ of the Jews?: The answer to the question of the ages will be answered using Old Testament prophecy.
Built around a close study of the prophecies found in the Book of Genesis, Gamboas interpretations offer readers clues toward the possible outcomes of the biblical predictions." />
