  <title>From Foster to Fabulous - Helen Ramaglia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a former foster child, I know how it feels to be alone, to feel lost, to feel hopeless, and to feel helpless. I also know you can make a difference in the life of a foster child. Ive been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my story is not unique, I want to share it in order to help the caring people of America walk in the shoes of a child who experiences physical, mental, and emotional abuse; is removed from everything she knows; is provided a roof over her head by the State and strangers; and then is thrust into adulthood totally unprepared but later succeeds. I want them to see, touch, and feel what the abused/foster child suffers and why they are who they are. I want them to see the major gaps in the childs life skills and social abilities and why they exist. We must walk in the childs shoes in order to understand them. Only then will we be able to truly fill the enormous amount of needs they have and feel confident in adopting, fostering, and working with foster children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must fully understand the heart and life of a foster child before we can effectively foster, adopt, or work with this vulnerable population of extraordinary children. I invite you to walk with me, and learn how it truly feels to grow up as nobodys child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little girl destined to failure, confined by abuse, and traumatized by foster care is inspired by faith to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
