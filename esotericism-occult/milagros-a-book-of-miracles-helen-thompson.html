  <title>Milagros: A Book of Miracles - Helen Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Let the ancient power of &lt;em&gt;milagros&lt;/em&gt; work miracles for you! Based on traditional Latin American talismans, these tiny silver charms are reminders that a miracle can fit in the palm of your hand. Throughout Latin America and the American Southwest, &lt;em&gt;milagros&lt;/em&gt; are offered at shrines and sacred sites by believers as requests for divine assistance, or as thanks for blessings received. Modern day &lt;em&gt;milagros&lt;/em&gt; may be carried in a pocket to protect from illness or harm, kept in the office to insure success, or placed in the car to avoid accidents--whenever you need a little magic in your life. &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Milagros: A Book of Miracles&lt;/em&gt; is a wonderful introduction to this ancient tradition. Filled with beautiful &lt;em&gt;milagro&lt;/em&gt;-inspired imagery, thoughtful meditations and reflections to enhance your daily life, and inspiring true stories of real people who have been touched by the magic of these ancient charms, this book proves that miracle do happen!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;center&gt;IF YOU BELIEVE ...&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young newlywed pins a &lt;em&gt;milagro&lt;/em&gt; to a statue of St. Francis after her husband suffers a near-fatal accident. After his miraculous full recovery, she returns every year to give thanks. A heartbroken man carries a heart-shaped &lt;em&gt;milagro&lt;/em&gt; in his pocket after losing the love of his life-shortly after, they are reunited. A surgery patient fastens a &lt;em&gt;milagro&lt;/em&gt; above his heart and is restored to better health than his doctors ever anticipated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Milagros&lt;/em&gt;--Spanish for &lt;em&gt;miracles&lt;/em&gt;--come in an endless variety of shapes and sizes. Since before recorded history, these offerings to the gods have been an essential part of Latin American culture. More than just symbolic gifts, &lt;em&gt;milagros&lt;/em&gt; are thought to be magical: if you believe and make your desire known with good faith, the &lt;em&gt;milagro&lt;/em&gt; may work its wondrous power. This book is an inspiring introduction to the beauty anddivine  blessings of these ancient talismans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
