  <title>Fire in the Soul - Helena Judith Sturnick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A respected college president is visited by the powerful energy of an ancient goddess in an Egyptian temple. To her surprise, the Sacred Being continues to appear, bringing messages intended not for the author alone but for a larger human audience. During two decades of communications from this Divine Presence, she learns that the spirit world is not a distant, ethereal realm; it interacts with our human dimension in real and tangible ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you&amp;#39;ve noticed the signs in your own life: premonitions that become eerily true, visions you can&amp;#39;t explain, powerful dreams, other paranormal and mystical experiences. Perhaps you are simply curious about the&amp;nbsp;supernormal and want to increase your own awareness and&amp;nbsp;understanding. Either way, you&amp;#39;re not alone. Spirits use humans across the globe as conduits for their&amp;nbsp;extraordinary messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can transform your life and the world around you if you open your mind to possibilities and train yourself to develop your higher consciousness. Author Helena Sturnick uses her personal journey of the spirit as an inspiration for &lt;em&gt;your own&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;mystical path. She shows you ways by which you might develop your own mystical gifts, shares Sekhmet&amp;#39;s messages with you, and assures you of your own innate mystical abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many others, from public figures to individuals in all stages and walks of life, are living their own mystical experiences, as you can too. Through expansion of knowledge in all fields, particularly the findings of New Science, we know that other dimensions may be closer at hand than many of&amp;nbsp;us&amp;nbsp;have previously realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part autobiography and devotional to Sekhmet, part discussion of many realities, &lt;em&gt;Fire in the Soul &lt;/em&gt;also has interactive elements to help you develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of your connection to the Divine, as well as to reconsider the meanings of reality. It weaves together the scientific, historical, cultural, and spiritual threads of mysticism and teaches you how to awaken your mind, heart, and soul to these phenomena and use them to enrich your existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After more than two decades of Sacred Experience, the author shares what she has learned about higher consciousness, spiritual dimensions, and the Divine within each of us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
