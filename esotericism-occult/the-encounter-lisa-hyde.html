  <title>The Encounter - Lisa Hyde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eight-year-old Sarah King lives in a small country town and feels like an outsider everywhere she goes. A tomboy with a sensitive nature, she isnt accepted by the girls at school or the adults around her, and the boys are the only ones who tolerate her. Even so, Sarah finds comfort in her connection to nature and to God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she tags along with her older brother and his friends on a misguided hunting adventure, she has no idea her life will soon change forever. As she is separated from the boys, Sarahs journey becomes one of understanding, spiritual fulfilment, and enlightenment. She encounters many strange and enigmatic beings who teach her about the power of love in all things; the relationship between humans and the earth; and the role of the Creator in all that is, was, and will bethe Source that is in all things. As she learns, she becomes aware of her role as the creator of her own reality and how her energy and choices affect the world as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tale set in the wilderness of Australia, a young girl encounters mythical creatures who guide her toward the path to spiritual enlightenment. &lt;/p&gt;" />
