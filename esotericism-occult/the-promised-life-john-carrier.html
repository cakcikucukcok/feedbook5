  <title>The Promised Life - John Carrier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can ancient wisdom help us overcome real personal crisis and find our purpose today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past twelve months, have you found it hard to get through the day--or even get out of bed--because you felt overwhelmed by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Depression&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Regret&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Loneliness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Anger&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Burn-Out&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lack of purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel like none of your go-to methods of solving your problems are helping at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author John Carrier struggled with all of this, until he found out when old habits stop working, when old assumptions no longer ring true, it&amp;rsquo;s time to look past the old... to the ancient. And that&amp;rsquo;s when everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John discovered Seven Gifts--ancient wisdom and current practices of the Jewish people that promote a life of meaning, joy, personal growth, and deeper human connection--available to everyone, everywhere, regardless of where you&amp;#39;re coming from. These Seven Gifts have sustained the most resilient, adaptable, and long-enduring people on earth for thousands of years, but they were never meant to be kept a secret, and now John shares them with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through illumination of an ancient tradition, clear action steps that are practical for the 21st Century, and personal stories that are both humorous and heartbreaking, you will discover how to overcome your crisis, find your purpose, and live a more resilient and meaningful life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you have to do: Start unwrapping your Gifts today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&amp;nbsp;Get from Reading The Promised Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading The Promised Life will help you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Break destructive habits that leave you feeling angry, frustrated, burnt out, and alone.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Develop better habits of continuous personal growth.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find mentors and friends to help you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Feel better about what you already have and who you already are.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Live your life on purpose in a way that feels more meaningful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Praise for The Promised Life&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi John Carrier&amp;#39;s humor and warmth comes through in this compelling book. This is for anyone who has struggled with the big questions of life, and isn&amp;rsquo;t that all of us? Dive in and connect!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
-Rabbi Rebecca W. Sirbu, Director for&amp;nbsp;Rabbis Without Borders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are Jewish or not, Rabbi Carrier&amp;#39;s teachings encourage you to live your life to your full potential. His methods have helped me immensely in my spiritual and personal life. A must-read for those seeking spiritual growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Kevin McIntyre, Photographer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I devoured this exceptional book in one sitting! The tone and gentle humor of Rabbi Carrier&amp;#39;s writing is perfect. His bravery in uncovering less-than-good parts of his earlier life is so appreciated. Most importantly, he made the Jewish faith so attractive; it is even tempting for this 64-year-old Christian woman!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Marilyn Grunwald, Writer &amp;amp; Consultant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Carrier is an ordained rabbi living, leading, teaching, and thriving in Burbank, California, but this is a long way from where he started. John was born in East Texas to a family of Christian pastors going back three generations. Finding it harder and harder to connect with his own family&amp;#39;s beliefs and traditions, he converted to Judaism as an adult. Some years later, John left a successful career in management consulting to attend the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies in Los Angeles. Today John teaches Jewish wisdom and traditions to students age 3 to 95, in person and through his Rabbi John Carrier YouTube channel. As a second-career leader in his second faith, John understands how difficult change can be - and how rewarding - and is experienced in translating the Gifts of Judaism for people of many spiritual and cultural backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
