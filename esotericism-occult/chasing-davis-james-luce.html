  <title>Chasing Davis - James Luce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When author James Luce was a boy, his father once summarized his moral philosophy of life in one sentence: &lt;i&gt;Your rights end at the tip of my nose.&lt;/i&gt; Many years later, after embarking on his own voyage of reflection, Luce finally understood his fathers words. In &lt;i&gt;Chasing Davis&lt;/i&gt;, he shares a set of unique ethical tools and blueprints that can be conceived and implemented by either societies or individuals, ultimately creating a moral life solely guided by logic and science rather than superstition or belief in divine guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luce believes it is time for a new genesis of moral living. He relies on several decades of research and contemplation as well as ancient and newly acquired wisdom as he carefully examines the difference between good and evil, the importance of self-awareness, and the reasons that morality is not dependent upon the existence of any god. Seekers of the truth and new ideas will learn the meaning and consequences of perception, as well as how to train ourselves to think more productively and morally and why laws, government, and religions are symptoms of our immorality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chasing Davis&lt;/i&gt; provides a practical, objective set of behavioral and cognitive guidelines that will help anyone live a moral life, regardless of individual cultural, religious, or philosophic antecedents.&lt;/p&gt;" />
