  <title>Haunted Islands in the Gulf of Maine - Marcus LiBrizzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is it about islands that make them ideal settings for ghost stories? Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because an island is the perfect place to dispose of a body or bury treasure, or maybe there&amp;rsquo;s some truth to the lore than spirits cannot travel over water. Whatever the case, with over 3,000 coastal islands, Maine has more than its share of those that are haunted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The proposed book features twenty-one haunted islands off the coast of Maine. A partial list of hauntings includes the following: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Outer Heron Island: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Death, panic, and mysterious fog plague this island, which is home to a vengeful ghost guarding a lost grave and a legendary treasure linked to a sea cave embellished in strange hieroglyphics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Swan&amp;rsquo;s Island: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A number of ghosts haunt Swan&amp;rsquo;s Island, but the most noteworthy is a spirit appearing as a young, disoriented girl who leads people to the cemetery in the village of Atlantic and then mysteriously disappears before anyone discovers her grave. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Mount Desert Rock: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The station at this remote rock in the ocean contains a demonic spirit that targets anyone who spends the night in one particular room, inducing petrifying dreams that reenact a tragedy that took place there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Roque Island: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This private island, which contains a mile-long white sand beach, is inhabited by the ghosts of a 19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;th &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;century patriarch, a maid, and a young boy known as Gus, who spent his life in a cage due to incurable madness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sable Island: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The graveyard of the Atlantic, with more 350 shipwrecks, Sable Island is haunted by the spirits of those who drowned there, those who were left to fend for themselves in a bloody penal colony, and two women, one who was murdered, and one whose lifeless body was desecrated to remove the ring she wore. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
