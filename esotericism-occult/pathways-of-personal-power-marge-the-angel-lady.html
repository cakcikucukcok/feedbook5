  <title>Pathways of Personal Power - Marge the Angel Lady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SAMARA SERIES
Book #1  Finding My Way
Most of us grew up being told we have to do this, we should do that, and we cant ever, ever do that! We believed those things because that is what we were taught by our parents, guardians, teachers, the media and our legal system.  Most of those belief structures are still there undermining our happiness and causing us to make choices to stay stuck with some of us stuck in guilt or shame.
These teachings in Pathways of Personal Power are channeled from an angelic entity named Samara, offering information, insights, advice, and practical techniques and exercises to help you make profound changes in your life, by clearing out those old ways of thinking or acting including habit patterns, blockages, limitations, negativity and other resistance, you may not even know you have.  It also explains how we got here, the choices we made, and how to reprogram yourself to encourage and attract what you want in life, so you can have what you prefer NOW!
A GREAT BOOK FOR 12 STEPPERS" />
