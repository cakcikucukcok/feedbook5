  <title>Functional Awareness and Yoga - Nancy Romita, Allegra Romita</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Functional Awareness and Yoga&lt;/em&gt; is an essential book for all who wishes to deepen their yoga practice and discover strategies to reduce strain or discomfort on the mat as well as in daily life.

Guiding readers through the essentials in body alignment by providing engaging explorations in body/mind awareness, the book offers a pathway to improve resilience and balance in action." />
