  <title>A Guide for Spiritual Living - Rev. George L. McLaird</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Religions come in predetermined packages. They come with an approved name for the creator of existence, the name of their superstar, their all-star team, their approved beliefs, songs, and, in some cases, dress codes and dietary requirements. In A Guide for Spiritual Living, author Rev. George L. McLaird presents a wide variety of alternatives if you are uncomfortable with or frustrated by your present religious experience or spiritual condition, or if you have no idea where to begin searching for your own personal spiritual path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Guide for Spiritual Living offers a plethora of suggestions for living spirituallyliving as healthily as possible, every day and in every way. It includes ideas for activities, contemplation, and self-nourishment, as well as advice for addicts to feed the spirit, mind, and body and exercises to help clarify your path. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Advocating a holistic approach, McLaird teaches that spiritual living requires flexibilitygrowing, morphing, and constantly being revised, refreshed and reinvented. He helps you structure a spiritual path that is uniquely yours by showing you how to listen to your own internal dialogue and how to use that information for your growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George is a spiritual guru of the highest order. People want what hes got and this book provides a roadmap for how to get it - a more spiritual, fulfilling, balanced and happy life. Ill be recommending it to anyone and everyone who will listen!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are served by religious belief/practice. Others are either indifferent or have felt harmed by religion. Georges workbook transcends either experience, by creating a workbook for spiritual seeking that can deepen ones religious practice or blazes a new trail for spiritual awakening.&lt;br&gt;
