  <title>COFFEE WITH GOD - Book 2 in the Journeys With God trilogy - Terry Hayward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although there is a lot of advice in this book about how to &amp;lsquo;do&amp;rsquo; your quiet time with God, it definitely is not a sort of DIY work on meditation or prayer. It was written in the hope that it would be a help in not only developing our own prayer life, but also of becoming aware that God is with us all the time, not just during our Prayers, or our Coffee with God. Paul tells us to Pray at all times and the intention of this book is to help us understand what this means and then apply that to our everyday life. The aim of this book is to help each one of us to understand exactly what it is that God wants of us and then to do it by coming into such a deep relationship with Him. In the book we will look into many subjects all of which are in a way related to each other and so the different subjects are really only chapters dealing with one subject matter, notably our walk with God by making Him assume prime place in our lives. Let me make myself clear at the outset that although I&amp;rsquo;m no expert in &amp;ldquo;Christian Spirituality&amp;rdquo;, I do I invite you not to just ignore my suggestions, but to at least give them a chance and thereafter feel free to make up your own mind about them. The book is wide-ranging in an effort to show that nothing falls outside of our walk with Him but all of them can and will lead to an awareness of the Presence of God.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Terry Hayward&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;================= &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
ABOUT THE AUTHOR - &lt;b&gt;Terry Hayward&lt;/b&gt; is a retired Anglican (Episcopalian) Priest who previously practised law in Durban, South Africa, for 25 years during the Apartheid era. He is married to Rita and the two now live in New Zealand with their daughter, son in law and two of their grandchildren. Their son was a game ranger in Zululand for 15 years and married a Canadian who is also deeply into conservation. The family have always had a deep love for conservation and that is where the inspiration for this and Terry&amp;rsquo;s other books stems from.&lt;br /&gt;
