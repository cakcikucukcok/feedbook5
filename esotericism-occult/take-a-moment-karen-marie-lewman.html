  <title>Take a Moment - Karen Marie Lewman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Take a Moment was created to bring joy and healing to others through words and photos that have continued to be uplifting, inspiring, and meaningful to me during my cancer recovery and healing.
My husband, after my surgery eleven years ago, would craft a daily message for me to keep me focused on my healing. Each consisted of a picture, a quote, and a short affirmative summary upon which I started my day. Whether before driving to the office, before traveling, or before starting up my computer from home, he gifted me with his inspiring thoughts. I created binders of all his creations so I could occasionally go through them, several at a time, to feel his love and his positive affirming words. I also thought that someday I would do something with them. 
They became my inspiration for Take a Moment. Knowing how much I benefited from these daily reflections, I knew that others would too.
So if you are feeling overwhelmed, challenged in your personal or professional life, have a tendency towards negative thinking, or just need to reset your balance, let Take a Moment bring you that uplifting, positive nourishment for your mind, body, and spirit.
Just take a moment to
be inspired,
be enlivened,
be nourished,
be at peace,
be happy,
be rejuvenated,
be in the moment,
be grateful,
be thankful,
be appreciative.
With healing love,
Karen" />
