  <title>Healing for the Heart - Peggy Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cancer, fibromyalgia, and rheumatoid arthritis are just a few of the chronic illnesses that plague many Americans, and Christians are not exempt. Living with a serious illness is not easy. The challenges extend far beyond the physical realm, and maintaining a strong Christian testimony is difficult. Growing in godliness and pleasing God do not come naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of such complex challenges, even the most mature Christians need help. They need more than just shared life stories or practical tips for facing their disease. They need more than poignant illustrations to inspire them or amusing anecdotes to make them laugh. While each of these aspects is helpful, what sufferers need most is the encouraging truth of the Bible. Only the supernatural, unchanging Word of God can give genuine comfort and effective help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Healing for the Heart&lt;/i&gt; is a devotional designed for Christians who are serious about seeking Gods help in their time of illness. The entries are focused on Bible truths and are designed to provide encouragement, instruction, and gentle challenge. Strengthen your heart on a daily basis with this biblically-based and compassionately-shared truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
