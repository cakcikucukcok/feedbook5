  <title>Take Back Your Health - Scott Werner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Werner, MD, and his wife, Vicki, have traveled the world, including the Amazon Jungle, using super foods, herbs, essential oils, homeopathic remedies, sacred rituals, energy medicine, sacred toning, removal of contracts and suffering, shamanic healing and many other modalities to help heal his clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was written as a sort of oracle book and has been tested by several intuitives to vibrate in unconditional love consciousness. It is not meant to be read from cover to cover, but to be opened where you are guided each day; the modality of healing for your system and body will be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would open the book each day, and it was exactly what I needed that day. I am so impressed with the energy of each story. It has helped me so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. Larsen, Utah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lying in my bed, sicker than Id ever been in my life. I received a copy of your book and read the chapter on Happy. It was exactly what I needed to get me going again. Thank you, thank you, thank you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L. Ryan, New York&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Scott. I cannot tell you how helpful the fear-facing chapter was. Today was literally a life-changing day for me. &lt;/p&gt;
