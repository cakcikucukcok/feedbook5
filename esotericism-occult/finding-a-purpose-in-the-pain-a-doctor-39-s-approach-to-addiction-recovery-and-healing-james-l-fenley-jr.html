  <title>Finding a Purpose in the Pain: A Doctor&#39;s Approach to Addiction Recovery and Healing - James L. Fenley, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Finding a Purpose in the Pain&lt;/I&gt; charts the course Dr. James Fenley, a Tennessee internist, took as he accompanied his wife on her journey to recovery from addiction. Along the way he discovered a path to recovery from his own disease-untreated depression and anxiety so severe that it landed him a stay as a patient in an institution. This led to his discovery that not only did the Twelve Steps hold the key to recovery for addicts like his wife, but that they could be used to treat his own anxiety and depression, which led to his present and fulfilling life&#39;s work as an addiction medicine specialist. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Dr. Fenley&#39;s experience of finding a purpose in his own family&#39;s pain is the basis of this insightful and easy-to-read book. Drawing from lectures he has developed and presented over many years, Dr. Fenley offers a multitude of recovery tools to help readers discover their own higher purpose and move toward healing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;For anyone struggling&amp;nbsp;or seeking to heal the&amp;nbsp;emotional pain-whether from addiction or other life trials-this book will bring hope to a difficult time and help illuminate the path to finding relief and peace. &lt;/P&gt;" />
