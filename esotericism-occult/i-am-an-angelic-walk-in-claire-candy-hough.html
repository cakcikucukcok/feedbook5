  <title>I Am an Angelic Walk-In - Claire Candy Hough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Readers first met Angel Ariel in Claire Candy Hough&amp;rsquo;s previous work, &lt;em&gt;One True Home &amp;ndash; Behind the Veil of Forgetfulness&lt;/em&gt;, and followed her remarkable journey through her Earthly incarnations as she fulfilled her spiritual quest. Now, in &lt;em&gt;I Am an Angelic Walk-In&lt;/em&gt;, Ms. Hough completes the story as Angel Ariel embarks on her most challenging mission ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many of us, Candy felt as if her life was&amp;nbsp;spiraling out of control. Her marriage to a cold, controlling attorney ended in divorce. A new relationship started out promising, but crashed into a nightmare of deceit. Her health and finances in ruins, this desperate woman wished only for death. Then one day, seemingly out of nowhere, everything changed. Candy&amp;rsquo;s entire existence was amazingly and irrevocably transformed. What happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve all encountered &amp;ndash; or at least heard about &amp;ndash; those rare individuals who change their lives overnight. The miracle cure of a terminal illness, the addict who simply decides one day to quit &amp;ndash; how do they do it? What happened to them to create a dramatic turnaround? &lt;em&gt;I Am an Angelic Walk-In&lt;/em&gt; explores these tantalizing questions and provides thought-provoking answers, a glimpse into the eternal and the Divine. Follow Angel Ariel and Candy as their two paths become one and Angel Ariel manifests a reunion on Earth with her beloved Twin-Flame. For all those who read &lt;em&gt;One True Home&lt;/em&gt;, this volume is the ideal companion. For those new to the story, &lt;em&gt;I Am an Angelic Walk-In&lt;/em&gt; introduces the fascinating characters and intriguing concepts of the previous book and continues their stories to a breathtaking conclusion. &lt;em&gt;I Am an Angelic Walk-In&lt;/em&gt; will open your eyes and touch your heart, that rare book that provides both an entertaining read and deep insights. &lt;em&gt;I Am an Angelic Walk-In&lt;/em&gt; is an inspirational and enlightening treat to be savored and treasured.&lt;/p&gt;" />
