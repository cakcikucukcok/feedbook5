  <title>Listen to Yourself - Kirsten Ahlburg, Ib Gram-Jensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Listen to Yourself is a sympathetic little book about all the near things. It is mainly about energy, about being in harmony with the people and the things surrounding us. When we are in touch with our sixth sense, we are able to feel what to do to get a good life. We often ignore our inner voice. Some people do so almost all the time, others practice listening while others still constantly realise that they forgot to listen and are therefore taken by surprise or failing to obtain what is most important to them. Listening to oneself is not important in matters of love only, but in all aspects of life. By listening to ourselves we grow happier, and more harmonious and tolerant – and reading this straightforward little book you will soon find that perhaps it is not all that difficult. Listen to Yourself is easily understood and full of common sense, wisdom, good advice and exercises that may help you practice listening to your inner voice." />
