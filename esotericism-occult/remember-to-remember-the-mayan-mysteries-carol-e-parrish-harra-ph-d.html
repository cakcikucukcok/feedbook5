Remember to Remember: The Mayan Mysteries
                 As told by a wisdom Teacher 
Awakening to Mythological thinking is difficult any time but to depart from institutional thinking and enter into the world of intuitive awareness is the opportunity of today.  This compilation and personal Insights to the Mayan Prophesies brings a new comprehension in Remember to Remember: -The Lost Mysteries as the known and unknown carry us toward a new height of understanding.. When one approaches the Maya Mysteries as parables and legends, as well as calendars and mathematics, a new doorway opens.
Beginning with the lost worlds of Lemuria and Atlantis we find ourselves caught up in the story of an empire that has left its impact. An adventure a waits, true, but this glimpse of a future more creative and hopeful takes us to the wonders of a world unknown.
From a false belief of envisioning our native forefathers and mothers as primitive natives we gain an awesome recognition of the wonders of encoded hieroglyphs; we move into respect and understanding through parables, legends, and oral teachings. A major aspect of the authors perspective is to integrate the contribution of the Maya with other wisdom traditions. 
Many of the lingering myths of questionable ideas are clearly included in the mythology of these people. Terms avoided in the rational and intellectual community rest in the psyche of all America and as we stir these ideas come alive. The goal of evolution is presented clearly in the unfolding of these long secreted concepts, such as sky-people, hollow earth theory, and others.. From spirit/space to science/religion we get an amazing understanding of what is in store for humanity at the close of the Ninth Hell; Has Humanity achieved it goal or has it missed the mark?" />
