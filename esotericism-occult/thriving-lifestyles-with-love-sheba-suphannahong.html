  <title>Thriving - LifeStyles with Love! - Sheba Suphannahong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thriving - LifeStyles with Love!&lt;br&gt;A collection of short stories for inspiration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Wonderful little Pepper-Uppers.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Each saga is shaped as a photo-essay and most need only a few minutes to read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A different way to get a glimpse into the every-day life in Thailand - a travelogue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are a few of the people that have left particularly large impressions.  Knowing them has provided inspiration, energy and verve; perhaps through this book, others will also benefit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each novella shines a light on some events that stands out over the years.  This is not an endeavor to bestow the title of &amp;quot;angel&amp;quot; upon anyone; rather it offers a look into everyday life.  Thriving - LifeStyles with Love includes people living in meager situations as well as University Professors, techies, owners of family enterprises, and many more.  It is their generosity of spirit, which cuts across all social levels and professions (also contributing much to a better life and society) that makes them so special.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A popular expression in Thailand goes like this (phonetic translation into English):&lt;br&gt;Kon Thai ben khon jai dee!&lt;br&gt;Thai people have a kind heart!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These stories delight and shine a light on the benefits from these kind-hearts." />
