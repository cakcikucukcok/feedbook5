  <title>The Treasure Is Within - Jane-Louise Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was once told by a friend that I lived a `charmed` life. It was not, however, until my life`s calm was deeply perturbed that I realized what real charm is. 
I believe now that it is the capacity to know, profoundly, that all is well when reality would suggest otherwise. 
This was the life lesson I was about to be introduced to, following our son`s brain cancer diagnosis at the age of nine, and the writings of `The Treasure Is Within` provided a lifeline to me when I feared I would lose all faith in life and in myself. 
It was only after the completion of part one of these writings that I asked who I was speaking to: 
Speaking to you now is your Higher Office. Behind each human `being` is this same community of hopes and desires. We desire for you to know that our attention in your regard is never-ending and complete, urging you in the direction of your greatest desires. When there is resistance we find it difficult to be fully efficient but when you let go in trust that all is working out for the best then indeed it does." />
