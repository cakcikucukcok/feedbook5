  <title>Signs, Signals and Clues - Willie Carter, Kristopher Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You designed this journey on planet Earth before you were born, and you left yourself a map and a guidance system for what you wanted to experience in this lifetime. This map is written in your dreams and desires, in the patterns of your family experience, your body, and your name. Your guidance system is encoded in your feelings, thoughts, and beliefs. You chose to come to planet Earth to play, manage, and create with universal energy. You are a creator in training. When you were born, you set an intention to experience a variety of circumstances in your life that would facilitate the learning and expansion you want to accomplish during this lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are guided moment to moment to live the life that you have designed for yourself, and you will know when you are on track by what you notice, by what grabs your attention. Working in partnership with Spirit, your job is to get clear about and ask for what you want. Your longings and desires are clues about what wants to be born and expressed through you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your perspective is your unique gift to the world. I now invite you to go on this journey with me and explore your world through your eyes!&lt;/p&gt;" />
