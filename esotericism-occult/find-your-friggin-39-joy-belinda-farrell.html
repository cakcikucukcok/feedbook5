  <title>Find Your Friggin&#39; Joy - Belinda Farrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belinda Farrell is a courageous woman sharing personal woes so that others may find strength in their own journey. She lights the path of hope, brightens the realm of despair and embraces the act of survival. Cal-Berkeley graduate, Mom,Snow White, almost CIA agent, stunt car driver, actor, writer, hot coal walker, Huna teacher, wild dolphin swim guide, shes a New Millennia Renaissance woman offering good health and holistic healing. Her new book Find Your FrigginJoy is not for the faint of heart, but a manual for those brave enough to confront their demons, face their feelings, and exalt their potential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broderick Perkins, Executive Editor at DeadlineNews.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book takes you on a journey using Ancient Hawaiian Teachings that invite the reader to take personal responsibility to unplug from the old non-productive stories and step into the frequencies of your Higher Self. Connecting with these frequencies can heal your physical body, bring you back into balance, lighten your load, and fulfill your souls purpose. Its all up to YOU! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Belinda was forty eight she collapsed with herniated discs and spinal nerve damage. Threatened with paralysis by her medical doctors if she didnt have surgery, Belinda instead chose to apply the ancient Hawaiian healing practices she had been learning for the past three years which are covered in this book. Her back completely healed including childhood scoliosis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belinda retired from stunt car driving and, for fifteen years has been sharing these healing practices with others. She offers Reconnective Healing and Huna in Santa Cruz, Ca. and takes clients to Hawaii to teach Huna and swim with wild spinner dolphins. The dolphins help us to dissolve fear with an open heart expanding our reality through their vibrational tones so that we experience our deepest joy.&lt;/p&gt;
