  <title>Astral Projection Made Easy: Overcoming the fear of death - Stephanie Sorrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;649&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse;&quot;&gt;&lt;tr style=&quot;height:15.75pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width:486.7pt;padding:0.75pt 0.75pt 0pt 0.75pt;border-top:none;border-right:none;border-bottom:none;border-left:none&quot; valign=&quot;bottom&quot; width=&quot;649&quot; nowrap=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mans greatest fear is of death. Because of this, a lot of energy goes into defending ourselves against this reality whether it be through illicit or recreational drugs, business or work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Astral Projection Made Easy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is an attempt to eliminate this fear through approaching the whole concept of life beyond and outside the physical body through Near-Death Experiences(NDEs) Lucid Dreaming and the technique of Out-of-Body experiences(OBEs). The author draws from a rich source of information, including her own experiences of astral projection over 20 years. Within this context, she includes Eastern teaching and explores astral projection from a scientific, spiritual and psychic perspective. She includes a chapter on consciousness as well as what precipitates an altered state of consciousness. In order to support her work she includes historical case studies of other writers and contemporary ones as well as her own. There is a section on how to identify an out-of-body experience, what it may feel like, and the very real &amp;lsquo;symptoms&amp;rsquo; experienced on a somatic level. More than anything, the Work is engaging, accessible and rich in content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
