  <title>Summary of Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams by Matthew Walker PhD - Summareads Media</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We humans have a very interesting relationship with sleep. Some people absolutely love to sleep, while others have the attitude that there is plenty of time to sleep after they die. Unlike so many other biological necessities, such as eating and drinking, there is still so much that is unknown about sleeping that it is possible to have such divergent and different viewpoints. Whatever a person feels about sleep though, sleep is equally as critical to a person&amp;#39;s well-being. Yet researchers and medical professionals can&amp;rsquo;t agree on just what benefits people get from sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book takes a look at what little we do know for certain about sleep, and what decades of research suggest sleep does. At first glance, this may not sound interesting, but with so much yet to be learned, sleep is actually a fascinating biological requirement that seems to be affecting every aspect of our lives. There are definitely dry parts to the book &amp;ndash; and the author/sleep researcher makes it clear right from the very beginning that he/they would be pleased if the effect of the book is to put you to sleep. This is in direct contrast to what most authors are trying to do. And there are definitely times where you will find yourself rereading or even passing out because there are some incredibly dry sections in this book. However, the nuggets of surprising facts will wake you up and have you talking about them. If you stick with it, the number of interesting facts pop up increasingly more often over the course of the book." />
