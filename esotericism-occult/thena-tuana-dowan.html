  <title>Thena - Tuana Dowan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;THENAFight for the Future is an inspirational self-improvement and spiritual development story of Tuana Dowan herself, of the people who had positive and negative impacts in her life, and of Thena, who introduced herself as Tuanas higher self in her dreams. Thena informed her of who Tuana was, the reincarnation principle, and the past lives, her pre-birth plans, her good and bad karma that she carried into her present life, and the negative intrusions in her current life. She also told Tuana that she was a Lightworker, alongside a few thousand others incarnated in this period, with a mission to spread light, in the form of knowledge, freedom, and love on Earth, and that she would play a very important role in the enlightenment of many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuana met Thena several times in the following years; besides acting as a guide in Tuanas self-improvement and spiritual development process, Thena gave her some information from the future, and all her prophecies materialized in time. Under the illuminating guidance of Thena and the positive people she met along the way, Tuana improved her self-esteem and courage, released her ego, and built up her patience. She set up goals in the light of her mission and pursued them, no matter what she encountered. She changed her career and became a trainer and a consultant in the field of soft-skills development. Learning to go out of her comfort zones and routines allowed Tuana to become a person with inner peace, mindfulness, and altruistic love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THENAFight for the Future encourages readers to reach for the hero within and find the courage to create a happier, healthier, and more successful life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yMPbrNqlls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yMPbrNqlls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
