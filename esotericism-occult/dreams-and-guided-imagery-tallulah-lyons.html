  <title>Dreams and Guided Imagery - Tallulah Lyons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the Cancer Project of the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) come Dream Appreciation and Guided Imagery approaches that can help anyone move into the fullness of living, no matter the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This important work is a vital aspect of an integrative approach to medicine which includes looking at all levels of our being and experience. In &lt;i&gt;Dreams and Guided&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Imagery&lt;/i&gt;, Tallulah Lyons provides a path for readers to mine the rich fi elds of dream work in order to actively engage their unconscious inner resources. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a tool to interact with dreams and guided imagery as a part of a life practice centered on embracing health and wholeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Matthew P. Mumber, M.D&lt;/b&gt;., Harbin Clinic Radiation Oncology Center, editor, &lt;i&gt;Integrative Oncology: Principles and Practice&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know from my many years of research on dreams and from my clinical experience, that dreams are the most connective and creative parts of our minds. Dreams sometimes pick up hints about physical illness, and also emotional problems of which we are not aware in our waking lives; and dreams can help us be more in touch with ourselves. &lt;i&gt;Dreams and Guided Imagery &lt;/i&gt;is an excellent and well-written book based on years of work with cancer patients sharing dreams in a group setting. It is full of vivid examples, as well as suggestions and instructions for the reader. I recommend it highly, not only for patients with cancer, but for anyone who wants to learn from dreams in a group setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Ernest Hartmann, M.D&lt;/b&gt;., fi rst Editor-in-Chief of the journal &lt;i&gt;Dreaming&lt;/i&gt;, and author of twelve books, most recently,&lt;i&gt;The Nature and Function of Dreaming&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Boundaries: A New Way to Look at the World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
