  <title>The Precious Pearl - Rev. Dr. May Rose Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For those trying to determine how to study the Spiritual Word of Truth today, you can depend only on one teacher: the Holy Spirit. No one else has the authority to do so. Why? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jesus called Him the Teacher, Comforter, and Helper. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He will help you to remember the things He taught &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;while here. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Teacher will interpret the Scriptures for you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learn about God, yourself, and your relationship with Him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you will learn how to be strengthened, forgive, trust, be lifted up, and discover what love is and how to experience it. You are worthy to learn and know, dear one. Yes, you are! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Truth student must read this book! Rev. Mays renewing words have a way of reconnecting you to your spiritual pearl, lying within all of us ready to be welcomed home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorothy J. Genske, co-creator with the Holy Spirit of the licensed Unity Teachers Training Program&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Precious Pearl&lt;/i&gt; goes beyond usual self-help volumes. Dr. Mays uniqueness is demonstrated in the personal application in the spiritual life she lives. Shes taken new-thought Christianity to an astonishingly high level. On its way to becoming a classic in new thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H. Leslie Adams &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thompson has found her own inner sanctuary of absolute peace. Through these writings she opens the door for us to find our own place of spiritual communion with God. Shes studied Truth and put into practice the insights revealed from her own spiritual journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linda Koleiny Streeter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im so inspired by the writing from your indwelling Spirit; the Master has spoken through your words of His wisdom and love for all. This is the ultimate gift. My shell is opened consciousness, that I may find Gods precious pearl within me. &lt;/p&gt;
