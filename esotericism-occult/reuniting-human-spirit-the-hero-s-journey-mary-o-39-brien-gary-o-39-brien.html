  <title>Reuniting Human &amp; Spirit: the Hero’S Journey - Mary O&#39;Brien, Gary O&#39;Brien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the second book in the best-selling series &lt;b&gt;CONVERSATIONS WITH DZAR&lt;/b&gt;. It contains powerful teachings and practices to help you move into a closer relationship with your Soul so that you can access its wisdom and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DZAR is a group of universal Energies, channelled by Gary and Mary OBrien. They share their compassion and wisdom for humanity to help us create lives filled with joy, a stronger connection to our Soul, to other people and to the Earth itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time for you to remember who you are, Young Ones. Time to move beyond the limits you experience in the physical, and to expand into your true nature as multi-dimensional expressions of Creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is about your purpose for being here, it is about you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;accepting and understanding yourself. As you read it, you will feel the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;call of Home that has lived within you forever. So allow yourself to be&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;taken along this journey; allow your eyes and your heart to open to the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;marvel that is you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are here to fulfil a magnificent purpose that will become known and available to you as you Reunite Human and Spirit in your life and live as the True Self. Within these pages, you will meet the Realms of Creation and understand the role they play to bring more Compassion and connection to your planet. You will begin to work with the Practice of the Universal Question that has the power to transform your life as you sit within its frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memories of Home that will return through your thoughts and feelings will begin to stimulate a different path. They will give birth to a new sense of Self that will allow an Energy of warmth and Compassion to be a part of your Being again. &lt;b&gt;DZAR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
