  <title>Don’T Be  a Foolish Virgin! - Sharon D. Watts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Title of the book is Dont Be a Foolish Virgin! The sub-title is Confessions of a Foolish Virgin.  When God gave me this title a few years ago, I did not understand what he wanted me to write. As I was studying the Bible a few years later, I came across this scripture, Therefore this is what the LORD says: Inquire among the nations: Who has ever heard anything like this? A most horrible thing has been done by Virgin Israel. Jeremiah 18:13 (NIV) and in Amos 5:1-2a says, Listen, you people of Israel! Listen to this funeral song I am singing: The virgin Israel has fallen Virgin is the Children of Israel, in current day we too are the Children of Israel. All of us are included. 
 My Introduction starts with one of my favorite scriptures, But the jar he was making did not turn out as he had hoped, so he crushed it into a lump of clay again and started over.  Jeremiah 18:4.  God is giving me an extreme makeover.
This book is my story of how God showed me his unconditional love. You will learn what sin is, where sin came from, when and why we sin, who has sinned and the side-effects of sin. You will walk through forgiveness, asking and accepting forgiveness, and forgiving yourself and others. My goal is to help you focus on your state of mind when you fall and prepare you to avoid the attacks of the enemy. Your eyes will be opened to Gods unconditional love for you as you read about Hoseas obedience to God by marrying Gomer, a harlot, to show his unconditional love for the Children of Israel. Do you know what your special needs are? If not, youll find out. Ill briefly discuss our opportunities to share with others how God has comforted and forgiven us. There is a personal Spiritual Assessment at the end of the book. This fifteen page assessment is for the reader to examine themselves. To guide them as to what areas of their lives that needs attention. God is waiting!" />
