  <title>The Namaste Garden - Maria Triano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if all you needed to do was close your eyes; take some peaceful, sweet, slow breaths; and put your focus on your all-knowing heart? Open to the world going on inside of you, one that is guiding you inward to a place you only dreamed was possible. The Namaste Garden opens a doorway for you to experience the inner landscape of unconditional love, where your Spirit lives in a constant state of ease, joy, and peace. It gently invites you to come home to your true self and to learn how our dreams are planted in the fertile soil of creation. It offers a wonderful exploration for children and adults to expand their consciousness and to create a nurturing relationship with their own spirits while cultivating trust and faith that life is happening exactly as planned (planted). The words, colors, illustrations, energy, and intention contained within this book seek to open your inner wisdom and send you straight to place of beauty, where you can clearly see and be present to a whole new way of experiencing life. Plant your dreams and watch them grow.
The Namaste Garden, even in its title, is symbolic of how I see lifeNamaste, the divine reverence and recognition of all other beings as the divine sacred oneness and the self in union, communion, and celebration. We are each a seed of birthing creative capacity in a full garden with other seeds of this full and vibrant potential and we are that garden in its fullness. As I wrote in Conversations with the Universe, the world is speaking to us, as us, all of the time. Why? To show us who we are all of who we are. Maria Trianos delightful book is to be celebrated as her unique genius and expression, flowering in the massive landscape of collective consciousness. We all encompass a garden within, as she says. And, as her example illustrates, we are each a beautiful radiant blossom here to gift the world its light and brilliance, in a way that is to be seen, inhaled, and honored. As you do so, your own garden will be nourished and begin to harvest the seeds of unique genius that nourish and blossom in the fields of all those awaiting your magnificence of your Namaste garden.
