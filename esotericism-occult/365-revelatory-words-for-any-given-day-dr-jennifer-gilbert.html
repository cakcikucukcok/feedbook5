  <title>365 Revelatory Words for Any Given Day - Dr. Jennifer Gilbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In her unique work &lt;i&gt;365 Revelatory Words for Any Given Day&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Jennifer Gilbert offers insights gleaned from life lessons she has learned over the years. Challenging events in the authors life led her to spend three years creating this special volume to encourage her readers to seek reflection, application, and revelation in their daily spiritual walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gilbert believes there is power in perseverance through painful persecution. She coined this phrase during the painful pursuit of deliverance from years of abusive relationships and other challenges that were overcome by the grace of God and radical perseverance against all odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author knows we all have those days where we just need a pick-me-up, days when it seems like just a simple word could offer a getaway, a reprieve from the day-to-day struggles we call life. That is what this book is meant to be: an easy, revelatory way of connecting with God and hearing what he has to say rather than being preached at with the usual scripture, three points, and a poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following on her previous books &lt;i&gt;Churchin Aint Easy, . . . And Deliver Us from People, and For the Perfecting of the Saints: The Five Biblical Ministry Gifts and What They Mean to You&lt;/i&gt;, this work is certain to touch the hearts, minds, and souls of her readers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
