  <title>The Soul&#39;s Journey - Lawrence Edwards PhD, Stephen Larsen PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE SOUL&#39;S JOURNEY: GUIDANCE FROM THE DIVINE WITHIN propels the reader onto a breathtaking visionary quest as the soul&#39;s longing to know the Divine is answered by the loving power of Grace. Dr. Edwards uses his personal mystical experiences to gradually unfold the tasks to be mastered and the lessons to be learned as we tread our individual path to the Divine. His wisdom is grounded in both direct experience as well as in the knowledge of Jungian archetypal psychology, Eastern and Western mysticism and mythology.  The book presents a rich interweaving of personal trials and challenges, insights from poet saints and mystics, uplifting experiences of the Divine being discovered in everyday life, and lofty overviews of the spiritual terrain from different vantage points. The reader will have the good fortune to find their faith and their enthusiasm for treading their path delightfully boosted by what they encounter in this book.
Joseph Chilton Pearce, noted author and lecturer on human development whose books include THE MAGICAL CHILD, THE MAGICAL CHILD MATURES and EVOLUTIONS END:
&quot;You have a treasure chest of experience - so rich a story.... The only one worth telling - the only game in town.&quot;
Dr. Marion Woodman, the highly regarded Jungian analyst, author of numerous works and co-author of DANCING IN THE FLAMES: THE DARK GODDESS IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS:
&quot;I find your descriptions of your experiences fascinating. I really feel that blackness - radiant blackness [of Kali] - you describe. Also your descriptions and explanations and in-depth experiences of the chakras are excellent. Many thanks for sharing this with me. I know it can be of value to many who are working so hard to bring East and West, body and mind together.&quot;
Stanley Krippner, Ph.D., professor of psychology, author of Spiritual Dimensions of Healing and editor of Dreamscaping:
&quot;...Edwards&#39; first person accounts are riveting. [His] descriptions of his Kundalini states are eloquent, including colorful descriptions of his imagery (olfactory and tactile as well as visual and auditory) and profound insights into the human condition. Edwards skillfully guides his readers through a pathway on which he has been an experienced traveler.&quot;
