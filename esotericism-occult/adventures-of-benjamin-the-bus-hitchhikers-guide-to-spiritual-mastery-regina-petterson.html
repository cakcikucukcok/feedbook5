  <title>Adventures of Benjamin The Bus: Hitchhikers Guide to Spiritual Mastery - Regina Petterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nostalgic for the innocent days of peace and love, and still scented with the patchouli oil of his youth, sweet&amp;nbsp;Benjamin, a 1966 21-Window Volkswagen bus, impatiently waits for his family to leave town so he can sneak out of his garage, and head towards the beach. Unaware that he&amp;rsquo;s embarking on the grooviest adventure of his life, he cruises along his favorite stretch of Pacific Coast Highway, carved out by a winding, majestic tapestry of mountains and shoreline. One after the other, three hitchhikers appear along the highway, each bestowing his own special wisdom on Benji as they travel together on a magical journey. His passengers are no ordinary mortals&amp;mdash;all are ascended masters from the highest spiritual dimension&amp;mdash;Michael Jackson, Jesus, and Buddha. They come with profound teachings that transform Benji&amp;rsquo;s limiting beliefs and low self-esteem, and ignite his belief in his unlimited potential to be a master himself. As the miles roll by underneath them, Benjamin The Bus joyfully awakens to his true divine purpose in life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For more information, go to: www.adventuresofbenjaminthebus.com&lt;/p&gt;" />
