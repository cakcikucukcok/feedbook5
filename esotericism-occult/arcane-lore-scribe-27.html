  <title>Arcane Lore - Scribe 27</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is guaranteed to be completely unlike any other occult text you&#39;ve ever read, whether it be some wussified &quot;New Age&quot; book about crystals and guardian angels, or some classic tome of barely decipherable ceremonial evocations.  No, this book is really &quot;something different.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You will find no references to potions, poppets, or pendulums; nor shall you find illustrations of magic squares, voodoo ververs, or Enochian script.  Incantations, folk magic, numerology, and the Seals of Solomon have also been excluded from this work.  What, then, remains?  Quite simply, a magical philosophy which can be applied, with great success, by students at any level of advancement.  Great emphasis has been placed upon self-knowledge and common sense-secrets have also been divulged as to various tried and true methods which will enable a besieged magician to kick the boogyman&#39;s ass.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Although presented as a work of fiction, this extensively researched text contains within it a great deal of occult Truth-and it is highly entertaining as well!  The author is clearly either a genius or a madman-perhaps both." />
