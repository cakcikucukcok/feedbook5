  <title>The Heart Speaks to the Mind - Elizabeth Temple, Amarjit Singh Modi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From Laila and Majnu, the Search for God Through Love:&lt;p&gt;
In the beginning it was Laila that connected Majnu to the experience of highest love. Then Majnu found within himself the power to grant his connection with God. Majnu shows that once you discover connection to the source of the highest experience within yourself, then even if God knocks on your door, you will say, Thank you for visiting me, God, but I dont need you to visit, because now I experience you all the time!&lt;p&gt;
~&lt;p&gt;
Singh Modi is a truly gifted individual. He has the capacity to help transcend others to a higher state of consciousness. Singh sees the beauty in everyone he meets. He is a gift form God.&lt;br&gt;
Tom Shugrue, President, Bond Brokerage Firm of Wall Street&lt;p&gt;
I learned from this gifted Indian man that every event is a teacher in its own right and every challenge is an opportunity to grow and learnif I choose to do so.&lt;br&gt;
Kwarma Vanderpuye, former law partner of Johnnie L. Cochran Jr.&lt;p&gt;
Singh Modi has a deep and genuine concern for the happiness of others. I rejoice for his boundless energy and skillfulness in cutting quickly to the heart of the matter as he cheerfully elucidates the path toward freedom for so many.&lt;br&gt;
