  <title>Rennes-le-Château - Jean-Luc Robin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;«I approached the Saunière affait with fresh eyes. I had his archive in my hands. I was living in his house, at the meeting place of a mass of information. I was confronted by a public which was sometimes scornful, sometimes incredulous, but always questioning. Each day presented a new challenge - each group of tourists created a new scenario. I knew that I had built myself a public when, at the end of each tour, somebody would ask me if I’d written a book on the subject.»&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here -at last- is that book... different, humorous, full of affection for a very unusual priest, packed with details and with documents. The author takes us, step by step, along the trail of Béranger Saunière, uncovering his secrets until he reaches the point where he must turn and say: «From here on, I must let go of your hand ...»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us leave the last word to Henry Lincoln, who says, in his preface to his book: «All those other writers - myself included - can only catch a glimpse of the truth of Béranger Saunière’s life. Jean-Luc has felt it. And so this book has something special to offer.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean-Luc Robin has known Rennes-le-Château since he was seven years old. Forty years on, he has had the privilege of living at the very heart of the mystery, in Bérenger Saunière’s own home. From 1994 to 2000, he opened the domain to the public, welcoming more than 12 000 visitors every year and telling them a story based upon verifiable facts... but leaving the Dream untouched.&lt;/p&gt;" />
