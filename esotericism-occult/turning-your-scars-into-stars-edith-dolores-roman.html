  <title>Turning Your Scars into Stars - Edith Dolores Roman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Turning Your Scars into Stars is about emotional scars on the heart, spirit, and soul. These types of scars are the most difficult and painful to heal. They consist of abandonment, chronic hurt, pain, rejection, and death. Two verses that comfort me tremendously are Deuteronomy 31:8, which says, The Lord himself goes before you and will be with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged (NIV), and also 1 Corinthians 10:13, which says, God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out so that you can endure it (NIV). My name is Edith Dolores Roman, and I must be honest and tell you that sometimes when life hit me full force, I felt that the challenges I faced were beyond my ability to overcome! Starting with my childhood, I was orphaned at age eleven, became a foster child, and eventually struggled to raise my two children as a single mother. However, with prayer, persistence, and the strength of God, I was able to overcome, and you are able to also! One more verse that helps me to continue to persevere through my problems is found in 2 Corinthians 12:9, when God reminds his servants, My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness (NIV). This book is intended to help people in struggles go from the pit to the peak! My prayer is that this book will help you heal and that it will nurture your soul, just like Proverbs 16:24 says, Gracious words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones (NIV)." />
