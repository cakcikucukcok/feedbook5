  <title>The Woman I Am Now!: Giving Yourself Permission to Be Free - Nicole Elmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We were all born to carry out a divine calling over our lives, which we often believe to be our dreams. In actuality, it&amp;rsquo;s God dream. The dream is so much bigger than you, and the sooner you realize this, the sooner you will understand that you are one part of a grand vision.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Recognizing this truth, however, doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop us from feeling discouraged and defeated along the way. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it any less difficult to grow beyond our painful pasts or stop entertaining those in our lives who mean us no good.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Woman I Am Now&lt;/em&gt;, Nicole Elmore demonstrates what it means to let go and let God. She relates to your desire to be a nurturer to those around you while encouraging you to tend to your own mental, physical and spiritual needs first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re ready to explore the depths of God&amp;rsquo;s grace and discover the freedom that only He can deliver, then join Nicole on this journey of setting the woman inside of you free, igniting your permission to shine, and celebrating all that you are and will be!&lt;/p&gt;" />
