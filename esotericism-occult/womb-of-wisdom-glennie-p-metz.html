  <title>Womb of Wisdom - Glennie P. Metz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Not only is the physiologic womb a womans feminine core; it is the gateway from where we all come from, and to which we all return.  The author reveals that the womb from which Lillimae was born was not just an outlet; but an entry into a place of creative potential and well-being. On July 9, 1960 she married Gerald, her teenage soul virgin, and delayed celebrating Gods design for their marriage bed for a short while.  Over time they gave birth to special projects, personal healing and relating to each other in their collective womb. It was not until a diabolical influence in her life, followed by a supernatural encounter with the Un-Moveable Mover did she appreciate just how wonderfully and marvelous she is made, and the power of the Giver of life.  Her delivery did not require the assistance of human hands to prevent a premature birth into a different kind of womb-an eternal one.  
Lillimae submitting herself to a greater power than she had ever known allows her to embrace and trust her feminine creativity, balance and deepest relationships. As she matures in her positive family dynamics, workplace and church affiliations she receives and advances a fuller understanding of the beautiful and abundant life God has woven into the fibers of her and Geralds rules for living in their womb. 
Womb of Wisdom brings to you the reader an awareness that the Un-moveable Mover who came into the world through a virgin womb, and will come again the second time, not as a baby to rescue His human creation by visible and invisible means." />
