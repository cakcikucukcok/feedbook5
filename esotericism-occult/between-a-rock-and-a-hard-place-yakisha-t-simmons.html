  <title>Between a Rock and a Hard Place - Yakisha T. Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of a rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by.&lt;br&gt;
Exodus 33:22&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The bible declares that there will be seasons of darkness in our lives.  There will be times when we will feel that trouble is all around us and that there is no hope of escape.  However, this inspired publication will provide an alternative outlook to the hard places we may experience in life.  The alternative is a supernatural encounter with the presence of God right where you are.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wherever you are in your Christian walk and no matter what you may be facing in life, there is opportunity for you to behold the beauty of Gods presence.  As you read this book, you will be moved to seek a deeper relationship with the Lord just as Moses did who sought the Lord and found Him between a rock and a hard place.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yakisha T. Simmons  is a Praise &amp; Worship leader at New Bethel Sounds of Praise in Summerville, SC.  She is a wife and mother of two children and is committed to living a life of victory and dedicated to sharing joyous living principles.  She obtained an undergraduate degree at the University of South Carolina and a Masters in Business Administration at Webster University and is now employed as a Technical Writer for the Navy.  She and her husband, Jonathan, are the founders of Life Changers Enterprise which offers a range of services from music studio production to graphic design/publications." />
