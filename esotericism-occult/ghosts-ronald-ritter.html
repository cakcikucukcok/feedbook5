  <title>Ghosts - Ronald Ritter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout all the civilizations that have come with such brilliance and disappeared almost forgotten in time, ghosts have played such an important in their spiritual lives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Humanity with all its intellect wants to dismiss as delirious illusions of a sub conscious mind trying to come to grips with the demons of understanding death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I live in a world that coexists between parallel worlds where not just ghosts but entities and energies live in an infinite universe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do I see ghosts? All the time. Are they real? Yes. Does everyone see ghosts? Yes and no. Like all things in our world, our sub conscious imagination can play tricks and they can be real, illusions or both.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Parents lamenting about the loss of a son or daughter, may in the heartache of their loss, imagine seeing the ghost of their child. A trick of the sub conscious to deal with the loss. However, ghosts do exist not just imagined for the loss of a child, partner or parent. When your vibration matches another energy out in the infinite universe, you have a connection. If you accept, they connect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, there is a warning accept only with love and light, because in an infinite universal as on earth there are good and bad energies. Be careful what you let into your life!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Twenty ghostly images and a few deep thoughts." />
