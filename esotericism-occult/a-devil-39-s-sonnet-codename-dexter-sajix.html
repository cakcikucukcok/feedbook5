  <title>A Devil&#39;s Sonnet: Codename - Dexter Sajix</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Codename, tells the story of Jonas and his slow ascension from a place what he calls hell. Whilst being there, mad scientists used him in their  experiments to make the perfect soldier, by using something called Genome cells. Something to manipulate and reconfigure normal cells turning them into super humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Within time, Jonas was released with the understanding that he would become an assassin, no strings attached.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The discovery of this made it quite clear for Jonas, that he will never wake up from his nightmare, but rather go further into hell, with his former target, Alastair Crane (A.K.A The Blood rain).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The decent of madness for these two will continue as long as the enemies of the dark city still exist. But, the real question is How long will they last?" />
