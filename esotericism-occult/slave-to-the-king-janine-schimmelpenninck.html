  <title>Slave to the King - Janine Schimmelpenninck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Slave to the King&lt;/i&gt; is all about responsibility, as taking responsibility is one of the most important things we can do in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Slave to the King&lt;/i&gt;, a specific description of how to take responsibility is discussed in detail. In contrast to the conventional form of taking responsibility, which can be heavy and depressing, this particular form of taking responsibility is in alignment with reality and functions beautifully. It generates a lot of space and energy, and it has great transformational power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All changegreat or smallbegins with changing ourselves first, and changing ourselves begins with taking responsibility. To take subjective responsibility is the only way to change ourselves successfully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already a lot has been written on the importance and the need for changing oneself. However, &lt;i&gt;Slave to the King&lt;/i&gt; discusses in detail the essential and practical role of taking a precise form of responsibility as an absolute necessity for changing oneself. To take subjective responsibility is an intelligent act that fits the logical mind of this day and age perfectly. The set-up of the book provides the reader easy access to an introduction and short explanation of the term subjective responsibility and to many detailed case studies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
