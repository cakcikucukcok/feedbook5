  <title>Shell Tones - William Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Perhaps because of being a math
teacher with an avid interest in
cosmology, the author has acquired an
expectancy of alternatives such as &quot;if
not real, then imaginary&quot; all the way
to &quot;if not matter, then antimatter.&quot;
This has led to the &quot;what if factor&quot;

(to the first power) a man can hear
sounds emanating from paintings in a
museum? To what end, you might ask:
perhaps a hobby of cataloging
masterpieces based on tones from one
to four? But &quot;what if&quot; (squared), in the
presence of a foreign object the
original painting becomes silent, as
silent as a movie poster or even a
reproduction. What did the painting
have that the poster didn&#39;t have?
What, then, did it lose? Is this cause
for alarm? In &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Shell Tones,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; it is!" />
