  <title>God Rocks! - Pidzar “Pete” Dremel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As I researched for the economy of Jesus, I came across an interesting discovery. The diet of the Israelites had dramatically changed from meat to fish. When you follow Jesus around the Sea of Galilee, you realize most of Jesus disciples were fishermen, and the two miracles of feeding the 4,000 and 5,000 were involved with fish and bread, and people from the neighboring ten towns flocked to Galilee for His healing, preaching, and an easy living. I was not surprised that the Israelites consumed fish extensively. It was Jesus way of creating that exuberant fish industry to draw people to Him and incubate more Christians than ever. He has promised us through the whole Bible that whoever believes in Him will have an eternal and abundant life. Today, I am not lacking because I have discovered His secret and would like to share it with you. But first thing first: believe every word in the Bible. 
Some Christians may have heard of Qumran, commonly called the Dead Sea Scrolls, which prove the authenticity of the Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts of the Old Testament and the rest of the books in the Bible, but they may not have realized that hundreds of credited evangelical leaders, theologians, and scholars had agreed and signed off on the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy. If you know the Bible we have in our hand today has gone through a long process of canonization, then you will look at it differently, and you will believe every word it says. 
If you want that spiritually and physically abundant life, you have to believe every word it says. Look at the Biblical Patriarchs, did they have abundant lives or second-rate ones? Yes, we could have a better life, the secret is in God Rocks!" />
