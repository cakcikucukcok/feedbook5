  <title>Unity Field Healing – Volume 1 - John G. Ryan, Carl Lemyre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Humanity is now at the crossroads of a massive transformation in health and healing. The opportunity to advance one’s personal wellness and awaken an amplified healing potential now exists. However, this futuristic healing requires an openness to the spiritual and energetic nature of our reality, and the consciousness basis of our human experience. For the seeker, access to deep and sometimes mystical healing can occur – through a journey of conscious personal awakening and the biospiritual integration which ensues. This mysterious journey kindles an inner power. This is a power that can heal and restructure your personal reality in mystical ways. But where do you begin the journey? And, how do you navigate the confusing landscape of Energy and Spiritual Healing? You have found your guide!
Unity Field Healing Vol. 1 provides a powerful catalyst to your healing journey. It consolidates a full understanding of all that is needed to understand and benefit from the new healing paradigm. It demystifies the confusion experienced as one first encounters and then matures in the new world of spiritual consciousness and energy-based healing. This foundation provides the springboard to take a giant leap into the future with the introduction of Unity Field Healing – a quantum-based healing potential that can catalyze healing in a brand new way. 
The book is a one-of-a-kind volume – described as the “go-to source for new-consciousness healing”. Written by a Medical Doctor and healer, who works in both traditional and esoteric worlds of healing – it is a unique and clear-headed consolidation of all you need to know to bring your spirit alive in your healing journey. It is a must-read book for anyone seeking to awaken or strengthen the mystical potential to heal in body, mind, and spirit." />
