  <title>Teachings Beyond Religion - Numa Jay Pillion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Death and reincarnation are the two most mysterious of the spiritual mysteries. It is easy to reject the truth behind both of them. After all, when a person dies, they stop breathing. The big question becomes the following: What happens at death? What is its mystery? Does a person cease to exist after their last breath has been taken?
Fear of death is what causes us to worship death. We worship death when we put death on a pedestal and pay for expensive funerals, dress the lifeless body in finery, lay the lifeless body in a satin lined casket made of fine wood, lower the casket into the ground, and identify the location with an expensive gravestone. Then we walk away, to wait for the event to happen to us. 
It is easy to believe that we do not live after death, regardless of all that Holy Script teaches, regardless of all that spiritual teachers have taught since the beginning of time. When we see a loved one take their last breath, we witness a fact. There is no hidden meaning. The loved one is gone. We are left with emptiness and, sometimes, unbearable sorrow. There are those who believe only what they can see. Death is the end of life. No amount of reasoning can convince them otherwise. 
Reincarnation is the second most mysterious mystery. If we live again, why dont we remember? 
This book is presented to provide enlightenment regarding these two mysterious mysteries. 
Knowledge of the most sublime spiritual mysteries exists; and some of the greatest esoteric teachings known to man are presented in this book for the readers enlightenment. 
Those who have eyes to see let him see." />
