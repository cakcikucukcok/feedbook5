  <title>Oliver’S Story - M.K. Sam Quanz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Oliver was a small parrot called a cockatiel and an almost-constant companion to Sam for twelve years, making his death seem unbearable. She was distraught and asking God for a sign that Oliver was with him. It took only two days, but when the answer came, it was more miraculous and peaceful than anything she could even have thought to ask for. Sams fields of employment have never included creative writing, but she knew without a doubt that  she must share this miracle with others who have lost a beloved pet. This is that story." />
