  <title>Learning to Silence the Mind - Osho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest spiritual teachers will show you how to quiet your constant, worrying thoughts in &lt;i&gt;Learning to&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Silence the Mind: Wellness Through Meditation&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mind, says Osho, has the potential to be enormously creative in dealing with the challenges of everyday life, and the problems of the world in which we live. The difficulty, however, is that instead of using the mind as a helpful servant we have largely allowed it to become the master of our lives. Its ambitions, belief systems, and interpretations rule our days and our nights--bringing us into conflict with minds that are different from ours, keeping us awake at night rehashing those conflicts or planning the conflicts of tomorrow, and disturbing our sleep and our dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only there was a way to switch it off and give it a rest! Finding the switch that can silence the mind--not by force or performing some exotic ritual, but through understanding, watchfulness, and a healthy sense of humor--is meditation. A sharper, more relaxed and creative mind--one that can function at the peak of its unique intelligence--is the potential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book includes a link to tutorials on OSHO Nadabrahma Meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times &lt;/i&gt;of London as one of the &quot;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mid-Day&lt;/i&gt; (India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
