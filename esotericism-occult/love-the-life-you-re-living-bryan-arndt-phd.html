  <title>Love the Life You’Re Living - Bryan Arndt PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is nothing you need, for all will be provided, when you are in love with the life you are living. And when I say life, I mean your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You did not arrive on this planet to live someone elses life, nor did you arrive on this planet to live in someone elses shadow. You and your life matter; you are not to be controlled or manipulated by anyone at any time into believing that you do not. I encourage you to always believe in the following statement and to say it as an affirmation: This is my life. I am here to live and love my life, my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intention and the intention of this book is this: to gently guide and encourage you to enrich your life regardless of your age (the younger in adulthood the better). First, you will work through a series of positive life-affirming self-assessments (aka, a series of steps) in Part One: Look into the Mirror. Second, in Part Two: Beauty Surrounds You, you will continue to learn how to apply and integrate much of what you have discovered or rediscovered about yourself when you are out in the rest of the world. You will also learn how to slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are you waiting for? This is your life. Live and love it your way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
