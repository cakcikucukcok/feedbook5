  <title>Fast Train to Nowhere - Tricia Duffy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Time does seem to be moving faster these days, leaving many people feeling overwhelmed and stressed. By learning how to make better decisions about how you control your time, you can gain a sense of clarity and hope for the future. Taking back control of your days can be a calming, inspirational, and transformational experience.
The bad news is that, for a million reasons, we choose to create illusions every day that distract us, slow us down, and stress us out. But the good news is that we can also choose to create better concepts and belief systems to replace the old. Do you have the courage to step out of your comfort zone? Could you step off the edge of the known world? By learning how to conquer time, you can also learn how to conquer fearand therein lies the path to happiness. Fear is the greatest obstacle to achieving our dreams and desires
To capture this power, you need to enlarge and redefine your concept of time. Our language and outlook have made us the prisoner of time, but our minds can set us free. We have the power to step forward and control time. We can expand time during the day, in order to accomplish more tasks without the accompanying feelings of stress and pressure
The choice is ours. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to move forward into a new and expanded vibration of time" />
