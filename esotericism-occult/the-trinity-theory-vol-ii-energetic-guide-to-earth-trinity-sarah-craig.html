You know the spiral, you live the spiral, and you are the spiral.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Society with its linear systems is not based upon the spiral. &amp;nbsp;In fact, it runs counter to the spiral because it is based upon the lifeless concept of duality. &amp;nbsp;Duality is straight, polarized, and flat. &amp;nbsp;This has created much discomfort and unrest for you because it dictates a lifestyle that is far removed from your natural way of being. &amp;nbsp;The pantheon of love/hate, wrong/right and bad/good have held you under their spell for millennia now. &amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Trinity Theory&lt;/em&gt; is here to banish that illusion and replace it with old-fashioned truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
