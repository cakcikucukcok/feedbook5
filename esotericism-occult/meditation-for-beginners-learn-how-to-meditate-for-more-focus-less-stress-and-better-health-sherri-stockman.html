  <title>Meditation for Beginners: Learn How to Meditate for More Focus, Less Stress and Better Health - Sherri Stockman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This beginner&#39;s meditation handbook may be small, but it&#39;s mighty. Easy to read, and simple to put into action. In it, you&#39;ll learn how to use meditation to say goodbye to chronic stress, because it is NOT your friend. Maybe you already knew that meditation is great for stress reduction, but there are so many options when it comes to meditating, it can be difficult to know where to start. This book narrows it down and offers just enough suggestions so that you can easily decide what works best for YOU. What meditation is, where and how to do it, ways to enhance your experience... it&#39;s all in here. There&#39;s even a free meditation audio you can use for your daily practice. The mental and emotional balance you can get from learning how to meditate is our natural state, how we&#39;re meant to be as humans. Finding this balance leads to increased focus and concentration skills, improved productivity, and an upgrade in your overall physical, mental, and emotional health." />
