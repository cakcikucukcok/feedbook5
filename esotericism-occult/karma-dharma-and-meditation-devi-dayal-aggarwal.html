  <title>Karma Dharma and Meditation - Devi Dayal Aggarwal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A person comes in the universe to do three jobskarma, dharma, and meditation. These three contain the entire philosophy of living. Karma is to take action for earning money, producing children, and bringing them up while living in the universe; dharma is to do this action as per tenets of ones dharma; and meditation is to surrender all of ones doing to God. However, he gets absorbed in earning money and producing and bringing up children. He remembers little or nothing of dharma and completely ignores meditation. 
This book, which is based on vast knowledge of Vedas and Shastras and over seventy years of experience of meditation, is the answer to the fulfillment of ones jobs (mentioned above). The author has made these very easy to follow and intelligible, and it is hoped the book would be of help to readers in achieving the goal of karma, dharma, and meditation, which gives mental relief." />
