  <title>God&#39;s Early Morning Intervention - Leslie P. Norris Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book focuses on God, on who he is and on his presence and work in human life. God reveals and God conceals. Whether God manifests himself or hides himself is not mans prerogative. It is Almighty Gods prerogative.
God is creator and sustainer of all that was, is, and is to be. There are times when the Creator-Sustainer, God, decides to intervene in human life.
My book came to life in six years, as God awoke me many early mornings and wrote on the radar screen of my mind, Be still and know that I am God (Ps. 46:10, KJV). God further wrote, Get out of bed immediately. Go to the den, get the journal, and write. Gods initial intervention, and many subsequent early morning interventions in 20052011, resulted in God energizing my mind to think my best thoughts, which I wrote in the journal.
God is the omnipotent, preeminent, and ultimate leader of the world. Notwithstanding, God is not coercive. God periodically intervenes in our lives and circumstances, and he does so without forcing us to obey him or follow his lead. When we follow Gods lead, we are following the lead of the One who knows the way and is the way. When we follow Gods lead, we are following the lead of the ultimate universal leader who knows all and who knows best." />
