  <title>Networking Divas - Monica Sparks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Being that the book cover is pink, one may assume that this book is for women only and since the author is a woman this must be a great resource to help women develop in business and personal matters, correct? My friends your assumptions are only partially correct; from the start  I can promise you two things. 
1) This book is filled empowering information.  It is a resource and tool for any gender and any age!
2) Real men do wear pink!
Before you read any further, please allow me to share a brief educational moment with you. I would like to clear the air and show you the relationship between men and their direct connection to the diva status. Divas (female) and Divos (male) do exist! Originating from a rich heritage and musical culture directly related to the Opera. Divas and Divos were the grandest stars with the most beautiful voices. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diva
A few years ago, I was asked to give the graduation address at a high school. My good friend, I affectionately call Aunt Star went with me for moral support. On the way she was listening to my speech to make sure that I did not bore the young adults I had to speak to.  Just before I was introduced, she turned to me and said, Are you ready Ms. Diva? For a brief moment, I thought, humis THAT what you really think of me? 
What a cheap shot just before I go on stage. She then smiled and said, Life has taught you many lessons, you know who you are and can now share your experiences to help others, go get them girlfriend! 
At that moment, I was released and felt proud to share my success AND mistakes to the audience. Soon after that event, I was invited to another organization to speak about empowerment for young girls. It just so happens that the organization was a church. Upon my arrival, the church had a gracious representative that attended to my every need. With-in my tradition and long standing reputation of keeping it real I will admit that the attention felt, well, sort of, kind of good. I keep praying that they ask me to come back one day. Anyway, just before I addressed the audience, the humble representative turned to me and said, Are you ready Ms. Diva? 
 I almost lost my religion, because, I know, just like YOU know, that the adjectives used to describe a diva are simply put, words we care NOT to use in anyones church! Matter-of-fact, the typical actions of a diva will get you sat down or drop kicked by the ushers in any faith. 
The very moment I almost lost my religion, I also found it at the same time.  I felt my calling, the need to help change the stigma for true Divas everywhere. 
The word diva has historically been used to categorize someone who is demanding, demeaning and downright witchy. My thoughts about the encouraging words from my Aunt Star and the humble personal care the representative was giving me at the church as her honored guest, gave me the true Diva wake-up call. 
Though their comments, they were simply letting me know, that they knew who I was, supporting me, reminding me to never forget my strength to be a conduit to connect and help others. The real beauty that comes from being a Diva comes only when you share strength with others to empower them. 
I was not asked to speak to the young ladies because my name is Monica Sparks, but the organization thought my message of empowerment would encourage, help to heal and guide the young ladies in the audience. The supportive words and  care I was provided, was a way to thank me for my concern and service. I was appreciated for sharing and giving the gift of my experiences. The light came on for me, so every time I speak and have the opportunity to offer encouragement, I do!
I learned that Divas are not necessarily rude and obnoxious people. They are people who know who they are and gladly give back to help others. It is that spark of loving yourself and others that drive Divas to have creative, positive energy that allows them to network with" />
