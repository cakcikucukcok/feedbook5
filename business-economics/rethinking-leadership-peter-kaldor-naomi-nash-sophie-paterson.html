  <title>Rethinking Leadership - Peter Kaldor, Naomi Nash, Sophie Paterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rethinking Leadership has been written for people who live and work in the midst of complexity and are seeking to make a positive difference. It is written for teams that are unsatisfied with simple solutions and leaving it up to superhero leaders. For organisations committed to growing a working culture that is agile and collaborative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition away from classical notions of leadership isn&amp;rsquo;t an easy one to make, especially within structures that were designed for maintaining the status quo. Offering leadership that is authentic, sustainable and has a lasting impact requires tackling many challenges. This book is intended to be a companion on the journey, providing a robust theoretical foundation for how we got here, and why we need to change. As well as practical insights that can be implemented by individuals and teams as they make the shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter who you are, an individual or a team, beginning the work of Rethinking Leadership, is an essential task which will unlock latent capacity, focus your energy and increase the resources we all have to face the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where you sit in your organisation: frontline delivery, middle management or executive responsibility, your creativity and perspective is essential in this process. The task is two-fold, to discover a fresh vision for effective leadership and to grow the capacity of everyone to live it out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the challenges we face?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can we build effective leadership for complex times?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can we develop agility with ongoing change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can we each contribute authentically and sustainably?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
