  <title>Developing Schools as Learning Organisations in Wales - Collectif</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wales (United Kingdom) considers the development of schools as learning organisations as vital for supporting schools to put its new, 21st century curriculum into practice. A growing body of research evidence shows that schools that operate as learning organisations can react more quickly to changing external environments and embrace changes and innovations.&lt;br/&gt;
This report aims to support Wales in this effort, gauging the extent to which schools have put into practice the characteristics of learning organisations and identifying areas for further development. It also examines the system-level conditions that can enable or hinder schools in Wales in developing as learning organisations. It offers a number of concrete recommendations for consideration by the Welsh Government and other stakeholders at various levels of the system.&lt;br/&gt;
The report will be valuable not only for Wales, but also to the many countries that are looking to establish collaborative learning cultures across their school systems.&lt;/p&gt;" />
