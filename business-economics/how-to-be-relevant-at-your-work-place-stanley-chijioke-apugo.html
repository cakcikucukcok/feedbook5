  <title>How to Be Relevant At Your Work Place - Stanley Chijioke Apugo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The workplace means different things to different people based on each person&amp;#39;s perspective about life. Everyone goes to work for different purposes but the bottom line is this: your relevance at your workplace is a function of the kind of impact made. &amp;nbsp;A lack of passion and zeal by employees at the workplace is a major challenge confronting most organizations today. People are not passionate about making a difference rather they are concerned about earning a living. This negative trend gave birth to my purpose in writing this book.&lt;br /&gt;
In this book, &amp;quot;How to be Relevant at Your workplace&amp;quot;: Discover the attitudes, attributes and approaches you can embrace as an employee in order to excel and be exceptional at your workplace, you will discover the fundamental requirements you need to be unique, exceptional and outstanding at your workplace. You will also discover how to develop the right values and skills that are essential for your excellence at the workplace.&lt;br /&gt;
There is no doubt that when you continue to make the right impact and command the required influence at your workplace, the effect will begin to show and extend beyond your workplace to the larger society. I believe this book will make the desired impact that is needed to take you to that next level which you desire as you read it." />
