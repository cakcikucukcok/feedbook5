      <meta name="description" content="If starting and growing your own business was easy, everyone would be doing it. And guess what? Not everyone is.  Start-ups have notoriously high mortality rates.  Most don&#39;t make it within the first couple of years. If your business is still around after two years, and you are too, then you have the equally difficult challenge of growing it.
In light of this reality, how do you make sure you are making the right career move by becoming an entrepreneur? How do you significantly increase your chances of surviving the start-up phase? How do you then stay relevant and succeed in growing your business in a highly competitive environment? SIMPLE, READ THIS BOOK." />
