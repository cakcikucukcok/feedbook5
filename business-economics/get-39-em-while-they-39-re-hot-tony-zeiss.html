  <title>Get &#39;em While They&#39;re Hot - Tony Zeiss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WILL YOUR WORKFORCE EMPOWER YOUR ORGANIZATION TO EXIST FIVE YEARS FROM NOW?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or even one? Don’t answer too quickly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that by 2011, our economy will need 10 million more workers than will be available. That means your organization must learn to compete—aggressively—for a rapidly dwindling resource: skilled workers. It’s a new reality that must be dealt with by every organization, including yours. Are you ready?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tony Zeiss, CEO of the Year for the Association of Community College Trustees, shows you how in &lt;i&gt;Get ’em While They’re Hot&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Endorsements:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“When you are in the highly competitive soft-drink business, every advantage helps. &lt;i&gt;Get ’em While They’re Hot &lt;/i&gt;will provide you with just such an advantage. The ability to attract and retain top-performing employees in a tightening labor market is becoming critical for success.” —DALE HALTON, President and CEO, Pepsi Cola Bottling, Charlotte, NC&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Get ’em While They’re Hot&lt;/i&gt; illuminates a serious challenge faced by all organizations. Astute leaders will welcome this visionary book!” —KEN THOMPSON, CEO, Wachovia Bank&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Tony Zeiss rightly warns of a looming challenge to all organizations, including the cities of this great nation. My colleagues across the country should read &lt;i&gt;Get ’em While They’re Hot&lt;/i&gt;!” —HONORABLE PAT MCCRORY, Mayor, Charlotte, NC&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Belk organization is strategically positioning itself for the coming war for talent. Zeiss’s book is a timely resource for any organization that hopes to succeed in this competitive climate.” —TIM BELK, CEO, Belk Stores Services&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m pleased that a respected educator like Tony Zeiss has written a practical guide for America’s businesses to reference during the anticipated labor and skills shortage. As he points out, creating and keeping a skilled labor force requires strategic effort from business, education, and government!” —REPRESENTATIVE SUE MYRICK, U. S.
