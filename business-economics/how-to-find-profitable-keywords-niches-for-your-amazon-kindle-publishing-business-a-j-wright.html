  <title>How to Find Profitable Keywords Niches for Your Amazon Kindle Publishing Business - A.J. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an updated book that teaches you how to find profitable and low-competition keywords and niches for your Amazon Kindle publishing business using mostly free tools. You can of course also use it for Amazon physical products.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most people, especially new publisers, looking for something to write on, would start by searching the top 100 list of books on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;
Ditch that technique! If you don&amp;#39;t have a single clue about Amazon niche/keyword research my book will help you. I have simplified the process completely without additional cost on you. I even offer after sales support to help you further in your researches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some people think niche and keyword researches are too complicated so they just go straight to Amazon and choose anything on the top 100.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a wrong way of doing it! If 99% of the people who do product researches merely choose any niche on the top 100 then it&amp;#39;ll be flooded with the same products in no time soon!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand SEO and Keyword research experts combine various research tools with the Amazon Keyword tool for finding profitable keywords.My book follows this approach with several examples and methods.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the first half of the book, I teach you step by step, with pictures, how to find 10 profitable keywords in the internet marketing niche for you to pick and use right away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the second half, I teach you 4 easy ways to do niche researches from scratch if you have no business ideas at all or you don&amp;#39;t know what topic to write about or what product to sell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you are serious about the success of your Amazon publishing business, order this book right away and use it to move ahead of your competitiors!&lt;br /&gt;
