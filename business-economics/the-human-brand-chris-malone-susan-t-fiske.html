  <title>The Human Brand - Chris Malone, Susan T. Fiske</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Why we choose companies and brands in the same way that we unconsciously perceive, judge, and behave toward one another&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;People everywhere describe their relationships with brands in a deeply personal way—we hate our banks, love our smartphones, and think the cable company is out to get us. What&#39;s actually going on in our brains when we make these judgments? Through original research, customer loyalty expert Chris Malone and top social psychologist Susan Fiske discovered that our perceptions arise from spontaneous judgments on warmth and competence, the same two factors that also determine our impressions of people. We see companies and brands the same way we automatically perceive, judge, and behave toward one another. As a result, to achieve sustained success, companies must forge genuine relationships with customers. And as customers, we have a right to expect relational accountability from the companies and brands we support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Applies the social psychology concepts of &quot;warmth&quot; (what intentions others have toward us) and &quot;competence&quot; (how capable they are of carrying out those intentions) to the way we perceive and relate to companies and brands&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Features in-depth analyses of companies such as Hershey&#39;s, Domino&#39;s, Lululemon, Zappos, Amazon, Chobani, Sprint, and more&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Draws from original research, evaluating over 45 companies over the course of 10 separate studies&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Human Brand&lt;/i&gt; is essential reading for understanding how and why we make the choices we do, as well as what it takes for companies and brands to earn and keep our loyalty in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;" />
