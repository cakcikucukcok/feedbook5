  <title>Secrets of Six-Figure Women - Barbara Stanny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;According to the Department of Labor, the average woman in 1998 was bringing home less than $25,000 a year. For every dollar that a man makes, a woman makes between 50 and 75 cents, and that is hardly news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what you may not know is that, quietly and steadily, the number of women making six figures or more is rapidly increasing. Currently, over fifteen million women make $100,000 or more, and the number continues to rise at a rate faster then for men. And these women come from every industry - psychologists, dot com founders, consultants, freelance writers, and even part-timers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes these particular women able to do so well in the workplace? Fueled by curiosity, Barbara Stanny, author of &lt;em&gt;Price Charming Isn&#39;t Coming: How Women Get Smart About Money&lt;/em&gt; (Viking Penguin), set out to research this phenomenon. What she discovered was that, though the high-earning women she interviewed came from different backgrounds and had had greatly different work experiences, they all had certain characteristics in common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secrets of Six Figure Woman: Surprising Strategies of the Successful High Earners&lt;/em&gt; will be a ground breaking book for high earners who want to ensure their wealth, enhance their success, and learn from others who are in the same boat. It will also offer inspiration, guidance, and motivation to those who aspire to make more. &lt;/p&gt;" />
