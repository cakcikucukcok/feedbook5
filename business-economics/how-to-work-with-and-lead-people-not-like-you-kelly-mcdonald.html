  <title>How to Work With and Lead People Not Like You - Kelly McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;If you&#39;re in a diverse team, you know employee differences can cause miscommunication, lower trust, and hurt productivity. . . It doesn&#39;t have to be this way!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;The people you work with may be from a different generation, different culture, different race, different gender, or just a different philosophy toward work and life in general, but you need to work together toward a common goal. &lt;i&gt;How to Work With and Lead People Not Like You&lt;/i&gt; explains how to dial down the differences, smooth out the friction, and play upon each other&#39;s strengths to become more effective, more productive, and less stressed. The keys are to find the common ground and identify hidden conflicts that are hurting productivity. &lt;p&gt;Many people shudder at the prospect of working with diverse groups of people, but they can&#39;t voice their fear or anxiety. At work, it&#39;s not OK or politically correct to say, &#39;I&#39;m uncomfortable with this person.&#39; In fact, if you do say something along those lines, your job may be at risk. Your company may terminate you for not being on the &#39;diversity bandwagon.&#39; So you keep quiet and you keep your thoughts to yourself. But deep down, &lt;i&gt;you are uncomfortable&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;p&gt;If you feel like this, it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re racist, sexist, ageist, homophobic, or any other negative label. It means you&#39;re &lt;i&gt;struggling.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;p&gt;You&#39;re struggling to understand people, cultures, or values that are unfamiliar to you. You&#39;re struggling to do your job with teammates and coworkers who may have very different viewpoints or different approaches to communication than you have. You&#39;re struggling to overcome differences and pull together to achieve high performance at work. &lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;re leading a diverse team, working in a challenging cross-cultural environment, or simply working with people who are &#39;not like you,&#39; you need to be able to get along with everyone as a team, to get the work done. This book explains the skills you need to communicate, motivate, and inspire people to collaborate—even if they have very different values, lifestyles, or priorities. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn key steps that bring cohesion to diversity&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How to have a constructive conversation about working alongside people who are different&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The four magic words that make this easier and smooth over friction&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to say—and why&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn to set aside differences and get things done&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn how to handle a racist, sexist, homophobic or offensive remark in a professional way&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Retain your sanity when colleagues drive you crazy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The changing demographics of today&#39;s workforce bring conflicting viewpoints, perspectives, approaches, skills, habits, and personalities together in one place; whether that leads to synergy or catastrophe is up to you. &lt;i&gt;How to Work With and Lead People Not Like You&lt;/i&gt; helps you turn a hurdle into an advantage so you or your team can do more, achieve more, and enjoy the ride." />
