  <title>Imbibe Entrepreneurship - Kingsley Chinedu Nnanweuba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Others have searched, it is your job to &#39;research&#39;, that is why you are a &#39;Researcher&#39; . . .&quot; These are the words of my Business Ethics and Law MBA Lecturer. He will further say &quot;Research is like building a brick wall but you cannot build it all alone. Your job as a researcher is to put a piece of brick (your work) on the wall (knowledge), while others will continue to place theirs. With this in perspective, I cannot cover everything in this book, though I wish I could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not claim that the content of this book is totally something new. However, I will call it an &#39;innovation&#39; from my several years of studying already existing literatures, lessons from the lives of successful entrepreneurs, lectures during bachelors of business classes, MBA classes, personal studies, interactions with entrepreneurs and my personal experience. Entrepreneurship is the solution to the economic and political instability in Africa. I have not seen a successful nation where the government succeeded in providing everything for its people. But great economies of the world ride on the back of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs control the world and its government. Their ways are always adhered to because they are job creators; but it is very important to mention that above job creation, they are problem solvers as well as solution providers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some successful entrepreneurs were mentioned or quoted in this book - men and women who made things happen in spite of difficult situations. And if they can do it out of worst case scenarios, what is your excuse? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I planned to achieve with this book is not to make it an authority or personification of knowledge in entrepreneurship. Rather this book was written with the understanding that reading it is not equivalent to offering professional services to you. With the knowledge got from the book you might as well seek professional services in the areas of your concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is impacting your world with the investment of your personality. That is what I hope to achieve by writing this book, to impact my world with what I believe and have invested myself in, on and with for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Although there are many mentions of Africa and Nigeria in this book, the knowledge can be applied in any part of the world and it will yield the same result. &lt;/p&gt;" />
