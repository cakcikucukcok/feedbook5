  <title>Ashanti Gold - James Crosbie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Colin Grant needs to disappear fast. With the police on his trail, a visit to his uncle in Ghana suddenly seems like a great idea. No more crime, no more jail, no more hassle. Until he visits the richest gold mine in West Africa . . . It&amp;amp;#8217;s 1970s London and Glaswegian Colin Grant is finally free. After four years at Her Majesty&amp;amp;#8217;s pleasure, Colin needs to make up for lost time. But when his firm&amp;amp;#8217;s next robbery goes badly wrong, he knows it&amp;amp;#8217;s time to move on &amp;amp;#150; fast. In Africa, Colin finds a new way of life and new friends. But, as he soon discovers, it&amp;amp;#8217;s a land of unbelievable and almost irresistible riches. And all he has to do is work out how to fly a planeload of gold out of the country without anyone &amp;amp;#150; especially Major Judas Akaba &amp;amp;#150; finding out. Ashanti Gold is a compelling, fast-paced adventure with a golden prize too good to resist. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
