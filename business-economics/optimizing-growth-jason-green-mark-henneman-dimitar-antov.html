  <title>Optimizing Growth - Jason Green, Mark Henneman, Dimitar Antov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leverage big data and demand into sustainable profitable growth &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Optimizing Growth&lt;/i&gt; is a handbook for how to succeed  in the age of big data. Today’s business environment looks dramatically different than it did even a decade ago, and it continues to evolve at an increasing rate; macroeconomic shifts, consumer trends, technological advances, and changing competitive dynamics are accelerating the pace of change, and businesses are struggling to grow amidst the turbulence. This book provides insightful guidance, real-world success stories and practical tools to achieve growth in this new era, utilizing big data to achieve a deeper understanding of demand, customers, competitors, and opportunity. With disruption around every corner, growth now demands innovative new approaches and an improved capacity to meet customer needs; by gaining a stronger grasp of demand, businesses can elevate performance from “survive” to “thrive.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book provides the approaches, analytics, frameworks, and organizational capabilities required to gain competitive advantage, and describes the new mindset required to leverage these tools into sustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop a deeper understanding of your business’s growth factors&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Re-sync your thinking to gain greater leverage against disruption&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Delve deeper into demand, and boost fulfillment capabilities&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Capture more growth opportunities using precision analytics frameworks&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The one thing that will never change about business is the goal of growth—but the paths to growth change continuously. New opportunities forge new routes to the top, while others become obsolete—does your company know the difference? The ability to differentiate between fads and genuine evolution is more critical than ever before. &lt;i&gt;Optimizing Growth &lt;/i&gt;provides deep knowledge of what’s out there, and a clear framework for forging ahead.   &lt;/p&gt;" />
