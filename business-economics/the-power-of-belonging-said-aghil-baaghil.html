  <title>The Power of Belonging - Said Aghil Baaghil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is rich with useful information both for marketing professionals
and for people who are simply interested in how marketing works. In that
regard, Baaghil provides a useful overview of everything you need to know
about marketing, which for Baaghil means finding a way to invite your audience to
belong to the brand, and vice versa.
Budding entrepreneurs in the early stages of founding a business would be
particularly well-served to read Baaghils advice concerning brands, since he makes a
passionate argument that branding starts at the business conception stage. Business
owners who dont think about their brands from the beginning, says Baaghil, are
still building a brand perceptiontheyre just building an unplanned, wild brand
perception. By the time the new entrepreneur is ready to release a product, if he or
she is thinking of branding merely as colors and a logo, it may be too late.
One of the most interesting and useful parts of the book is Baaghils ongoing
engagement with the problems of business and marketing specifically with regard to
the Middle East and the developing world. He speaks warmly yet firmly to Middle
Eastern CEOs, providing them with needful advice that comes from his clear vision
of how far there is to go, but more importantly, how great the possibilities are for
business and culture in the region.
For the past twenty years of my life I have striven to excel in a field I passionately
lovemarketing. From my days at the University of Maine pursuing my marketing
degree until today my life has been marketing. My early experience in the profession
dates back to 1990, when I joined a reputable company, Edison Brothers, based
out of St Louis, Missouri. Now I have risen from an employee to a self-employed
entrepreneur who has created numerous companies for himself and others. My
experience speaks for itselfthrough my marketing work, the books Ive authored,
and my consultancies." />
