  <title>The Retail Revolution - Nelson Lichtenstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The definitive account of how a small Ozarks company upended the world of business and what that change means&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart, the world&#39;s largest company, roared out of the rural South to change the way business is done. Deploying computer-age technology, Reagan-era politics, and Protestant evangelism, Sam Walton&#39;s firm became a byword for cheap goods and low-paid workers, famed for the ruthless efficiency of its global network of stores and factories. But the revolution has gone further: Sam&#39;s protégés have created a new economic order which puts thousands of manufacturers, indeed whole regions, in thrall to a retail royalty. Like the Pennsylvania Railroad and General Motors in their heyday, Wal-Mart sets the commercial model for a huge swath of the global economy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this lively, probing investigation, historian Nelson Lichtenstein deepens and expands our knowledge of the merchandising giant. He shows that Wal-Mart&#39;s rise was closely linked to the cultural and religious values of Bible Belt America as well as to the imperial politics, deregulatory economics, and laissez-faire globalization of Ronald Reagan and his heirs. He explains how the company&#39;s success has transformed American politics, and he anticipates a day of reckoning, when challenges to the Wal-Mart way, at home and abroad, are likely to change the far-flung empire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insightful, original, and steeped in the culture of retail life, &lt;i&gt;The Retail Revolution&lt;/i&gt; draws on first hand reporting from coastal China to rural Arkansas to give a fresh and necessary understanding of the phenomenon that has transformed international commerce.&lt;/p&gt;" />
