  <title>UnBranding - Scott Stratten, Alison Stratten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;UnBranding&lt;/i&gt; breaks through the noise of disruption.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;We live in a transformative time. The digital age has given us unlimited access to information and affected all our traditional business relationships – from how we hire and manage, to how we communicate with our current and would-be customers. Innovation continues to create opportunities for emerging products and services we never thought possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With all the excitement of our time, comes confusion and fear for many businesses. Change can be daunting, and never have we lived in a time where change came so quickly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the age of disruption – it&#39;s fast-paced, far-reaching and is forever changing how we operate, create, connect, and market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s easy to see why brand heads are spinning. Businesses are suffering from &#39;the next big thing&#39; and we&#39;re here to help you find the cure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;UnBranding&lt;/i&gt; is about focus – it&#39;s about seeing that within these new strategies, technologies and frameworks fighting for our attention, lay the tried and true tenants of good business – because innovation is nothing but a bright and shiny new toy, unless it actually works. &lt;i&gt;UnBranding&lt;/i&gt; is here to remind you that you can&#39;t fix rude staff, mediocre products and a poor brand reputation with a fancy new app.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are going to learn from 100 branding stories that will challenge your assumptions about business today and teach valuable, actionable lessons. It&#39;s not about going backwards, it&#39;s about moving forward with purpose, getting back to the core of good branding while continuing to innovate and improve without leaving your values behind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some topics will include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Growing and maintaining your brand voice through the noise&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How to focus on the right tools for your business, for the right reasons&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Maintaining trust, consistency and connection through customer service and community&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The most important question to ask yourself before innovation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The importance of personal branding in the digital age&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How to successful navigate feedback and reviews&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s time for a reality check. It&#39;s time to solve problems, create connections, and provide value rather than rush strategy just to make headlines. &lt;i&gt;UnBranding&lt;/i&gt; gives you the guidance you need to navigate the age of disruption and succeed in business today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
