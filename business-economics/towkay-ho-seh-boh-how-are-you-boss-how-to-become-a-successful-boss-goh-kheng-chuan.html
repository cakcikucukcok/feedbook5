Entrepreneurship is encouraged at all levels from primary school to university. Now, everyone wants to become a towkay. But do they know the hard work and heartbreak of becoming a towkay? Do they know what are the realities of being a towkay? Newspapers and TV only show towkays driving Mercedes, wearing Rolexes, and living in big houses along Bukit Timah.

There is no shortcut to success. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Straight-talking Book Written In English With A Good Dose of Singlish, Hokkien and Chinese" />
