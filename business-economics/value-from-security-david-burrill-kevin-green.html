  <title>Value from Security - David Burrill, Kevin Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Today, in a globally insecure world, corporate security should be a key driver of shareholder value. All too often security is not consistently linked to core strategic areas like risk management and strategic planning. A lack of measures and metrics to quantify its contribution has slowed down its chances to earn a rightful place at the top table.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;B&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Where world-class companies have embraced an approach to security as a value adding function, significant business and organisation benefits have emerged. These include productivity gains, new revenue opportunities, and improved corporate reputation and resilience. &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;It is time for more people to have the opportunity to discover how security can perform a transformational role, not simply a passive one.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book demonstrates what security&#39;s real capabilities are, and what needs to be done to realise them. The experiences presented have occurred in real organisations, globally, that are reaping the rewards of being at the vanguard of this new approach to security management. &lt;/P&gt;" />
