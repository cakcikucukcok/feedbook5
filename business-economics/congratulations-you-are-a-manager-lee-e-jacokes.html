      <meta name="description" content="Congratulations, you are a Manager!  For many aspiring and newly minted managers this good news is frequently followed with the question, Now what do I do?  And no wonder, since 80% or more of new managers and supervisors have neither formal preparation nor the time to pursue such training.  Congratulations!  You are a Manager! provides answers by addressing the many challenges confronting managers whether they come from business, profit or non-profit, manufacturing, or service organizations.   
More than a how-to-do book Management is presented as a professional calling distinct from the specialty one manages, the types of knowledge and skills needed, and the managerial tasks and processes to be mastered.  Managerial challenges such as supervising former peers, transitioning from specialist to manager, planning, motivating, leading, conducting meetings, evaluating, and budgeting are explained.  
These tasks and processes are integrated within the context of organizational forces such as culture, communication networks, rational/non-rational forces, and organizational structure.
Reading this short, concise presentation about essential managerial knowledge and skills and ways organizational forces can help or hinder performance will greatly improve a managers/supervisors chances for success." />
