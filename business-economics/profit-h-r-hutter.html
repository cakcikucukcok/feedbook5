  <title>Profit - H.R. Hutter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you want to take your business to the next level, then this book could lead you there. You most likely have a love for whatever area you have chosen as a focus for your business. This is a great start. However, many small business owners do not have the business and management background to make that business as profitable as it could be. In consulting with many of these small businesses, I found that a few simple business practices could be very beneficial to their growth. In this book, I will try to share some of these practices with you. This book is designed to help an entrepreneur increase his profit by introducing how he can use a simplified profit-and-loss statement of four to ten items as a tool to analyze his business from a financial perspective. He will be shown how he can use these items in a formula to help him plan and make decisions for future growth and profit. We will discuss skills and practices that have been used to improve sales, management, leadership, and planning skills. This book is designed to help you improve your profitability." />
