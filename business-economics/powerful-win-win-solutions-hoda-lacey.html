  <title>Powerful Win Win Solutions - Hoda Lacey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for both managers and those they manage.  It is for both individuals and teams.  It is a practical book which, I hope, will speak to both your hearts and your minds.
Since this book was first published in 2000, I have received many encouraging comments from readers telling me what a difference it has made to their lives.  The book has been purchased by libraries, prisons, social services, universities and students.  It has been recommended as essential reading material by various training organizations and educational establishments.  It has also been translated into three languages.
But the book was a hardback edition retailing at a high price.  This meant that it was out of the reach of many of the people for whom I originally wrote the book. I hope that by having it republished in paperback at a more affordable price range, more people will be able to purchase it and put the skills into practice.
I know this book works.  It is based on material from the excellent 12 Skills Programme from the Conflict Resolution Network of Australia (CRN).  (www.crnhq.org).
While grappling with my own conflict issues, fate brought me into contact with the teachings of the CRN, a network of people with a common commitment to conflict resolution, co-operative communication strategies and related skills." />
