  <title>The General Theory of the Translation Company - Renato Beninatto, Tucker Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You are reading this summary of the book, so we&amp;rsquo;re assuming you&amp;rsquo;re looking for answers. Too bad. Instead, we want to ask you some questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are you new to language services, an experienced industry veteran, or an industry outsider who would like to learn more?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have you been waiting your whole life for somebody (anybody) to please publish a book about the language services industry that doesn&amp;rsquo;t bore you to tears?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are you a translator or owner of an LSP that is looking for insight into how to grow your business and make more money doing what you love?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Has your manager just told you that you are now in charge of something called &amp;ldquo;localization&amp;rdquo; and you need to figure out what the hell they are talking about?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are you a manager that has just told your employee they are in charge of something called &amp;ldquo;localization&amp;rdquo; and would like to give them a book so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to pretend you know what the hell you are talking about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered yes, no, or maybe to zero or more of the above questions, then this, my friend, is the book for you! &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The General Theory of the Translation Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; condenses decades of combined experience in an easily digestible and entertaining format. Just like this back-of-the-book-summary, it does not provide all the answers. It teaches us how to ask better questions and to have more meaningful conversations about language services.&lt;/p&gt;" />
