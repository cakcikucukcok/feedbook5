  <title>This Is How We Rise - Claudia Chan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;From an inspiring voice in the movement for gender equality, a practical guide to achieving success through a new kind of leadership--rooted in purpose and activism for social change&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We live in a time of unprecedented opportunity for women. Yet despite centuries of progress, true equality remains out of reach. What will it take to bring us to a tipping point?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To leadership expert and social entrepreneur Claudia Chan, the key is shifting to a &quot;me for we&quot; mindset, where individuals root their effort in a mission far bigger than personal success, and getting everyone--women and men--to work together for social change. By lifting others, we not only make the world better, but we can also discover our greatest meaning and achieve lasting fulfillment. In &lt;i&gt;This Is How We Rise&lt;/i&gt;, Claudia encourages readers to join a new breed of leaders and become change makers for gender equality. Distilling wisdom and insights from her own personal and professional journey, she shares key lessons learned and offers a toolbox of thirteen foundational habits. Claudia shows how to define and develop your own purpose, vision, and pathway to becoming a thriving agent for good. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whether you own your own business or are part of the corporate world, whether you&#39;re at the top of your field or are just starting out in your career, you have the power to lead change and achieve extraordinary success in all areas of your life. &lt;i&gt;This Is How We Rise &lt;/i&gt;will show you how to unleash it. &lt;/div&gt;" />
