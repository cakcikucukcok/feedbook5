&lt;br /&gt;
Part 2: The Relevance of Time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the first book of this series on Forex Trading, the time and price strategy was introduced. The second book will be a follow up and its main aim is to breakdown the concept of time in the easiest and most understandable way possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book will include examples of each facet of time as discussed in the first book. This will give the reader a better understanding of the Time and Price strategy. Not every time is suitable for trading just because the market is open; the market has an opening time and a closing time. Especially in the foreign exchange market where the market runs for 24 hour a day 5 1/2 days a week it is important to know when to be in and when to be out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you understand the concept of time in trading it will be a huge improvement to your daily trading. You will understand why the big players enter at a specific moment in the market and when they stay out.&lt;br /&gt;
