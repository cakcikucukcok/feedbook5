Most underperforming dealerships are doing so not because of the car line they sell, the location theyre in, their employees, or even the advertising but for only one reasonfear.
	The word fear may sound nonsensical to a dealer who has been in business for thirty years or more, but ask yourself a few questions. If your store is not performing, do you know why? If so, why havent you made important changes? 
	A dealer from a premium franchise recently admitted that he avoids changes in order to keep his staff of over twenty years intact. This is what I call broken thoughts. Youll find out how to overcome these broken thoughts with the three-car sales system described in this book and how to turn your dealership into a well-oiled machine." />
