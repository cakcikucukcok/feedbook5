  <title>Our Separate Ways - Ella L. J. Bell Smith, Stella M. Nkomo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Our Separate Ways&lt;/i&gt;, authors Ella Bell and Stella Nkomo take an unflinching look at the surprising differences between black and white women&#39;s trials and triumphs on their way up the corporate ladder. Based on groundbreaking research that spanned eight years, &lt;i&gt;Our Separate Ways&lt;/i&gt; compares and contrasts the experiences of 120 black and white female managers in the American business arena. In-depth histories bring to life the women&#39;s powerful and often difficult journeys from childhood to professional success, highlighting the roles that gender, race, and class played in their development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although successful professional women come from widely diverse family backgrounds, educational experiences, and community values, they share a common assumption upon entering the workforce: &quot;I have a &lt;i&gt;chance&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; Along the way, however, they discover that people question their authority, challenge their intelligence, and discount their ideas. And while gender is a common denominator among these women, race and class are often wedges between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Our Separate Ways&lt;/i&gt;, you will find candid discussions about stereotypes, learn how black women&#39;s early experiences affect their attitudes in the business world, become aware of how white women have--perhaps unwittingly--aligned themselves more often with white men than with black women, and see ways that our country continues to come to terms with diversity in &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of its dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a human resources director wondering why you&#39;re having trouble retaining black women, a white female manager considering the role of race in your office, or a black female manager searching for perspectives, you will find fresh insights about how black and white women&#39;s struggles differ and encounter provocative ideas for creating a better workplace environment for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
