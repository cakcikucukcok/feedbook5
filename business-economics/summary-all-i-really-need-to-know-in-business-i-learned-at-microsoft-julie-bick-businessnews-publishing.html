  <title>Summary: All I Really Need to Know in Business I learned at Microsoft - Julie Bick - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;ALL I REALLY NEED TO KNOW IN BUSINESS I LEARNED AT MICROSOFT: Insider Strategies to Help You Succeed&quot; by Julie Bick.&lt;br&gt;Microsoft is one of the successful companies in the world, and is often considered to be a shining example of a business that is able to change quickly and effectively to accommodate shifts in the market.  The intense, dynamic working environment is filled with highly motivated and hard-working individuals, making it a superb place to learn strong management skills. &lt;br&gt;With her experience as a senior product manager for Microsoft, Julie Bick brings Microsoft’s management strategies under the microscope to identify what works and what doesn’t. She outlines all she has learnt on running a business, being a good manager, being a strong communicator and managing a career – all lessons learnt at Microsoft. Each section is broken down into simple and actionable lessons, from how to give constructive feedback to always keeping an up-to-date resume. Whilst an experienced manager might find this summary a little obvious, it is certainly a good starting point for an aspiring or less experienced manager, or someone in the early stages of their career." />
