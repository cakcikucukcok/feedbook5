  <title>Lessons from the Links - Elly Valas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Players on the golf course must battle the course and conditions in order to succeed. While a caddy might lend a hand carrying the load, individuals must rely on their own strengths to accomplish goals.
Business is also a singular endeavor, and owners and managers must battle market conditions, competitors, and unexpected challenges. To succeed, a business must hire the right people, invest in the right training, and deliver world-class customer service.
Golfer and business owner Elizabeth knows these lessons well; hoping to help her friend Matt, she teaches him the lessons shes learned over a friendly game of golf. What ensues is a detailed tutorial on how to successfully operate a business.
As Matt plays each hole, he learns why vision is so important in reaching goals, how to clearly articulate an end game, ways to avoid hazards and how to escape them, and many other lessons from the golf course.
If business owners managed their businesses the way professional golfers play the game, they will find themselves more successful and more profitableand theyll have more fun in the bargain! Find out how to succeed in business with &lt;i&gt;Lessons from the Links.&lt;/i&gt;" />
