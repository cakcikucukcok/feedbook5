  <title>Start Your Own Home Business After 50: How to Survive, Thrive, and Earn the Income You Deserve - Robert W. Bly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Written for people who are old enough to know who they are, what they want, and what skills they are best at, this guide shows exactly how to build a successful and profitable business. Older people are among the world&amp;#8217;s most successful entrepreneurs with a wealth of in-depth experience, education, and mature judgment that younger people can&amp;#8217;t match; they also care more about creating financial security and doing what they want. Business consultant and serial entrepreneur Robert Bly teaches how to find the right home business opportunity; determine the target market for that business; sell the right product to the market at a profit; manage the business without wasting time; effectively market the business; comply with all laws, regulations, and taxes for the business; and generate enough income for retirement. Covering every aspect of building a successful business, not just the broad outlines, this book also provides senior-oriented information on computer equipment, the internet, and social media marketing." />
