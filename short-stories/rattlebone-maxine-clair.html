  <title>Rattlebone - Maxine Clair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Rattlebone&lt;/I&gt;, a &quot;fictional&quot; black community north of Kansas City, the smell of manure and bacon from Armour&#39;s Packing House is everywhere; Shady Maurice&#39;s roadhouse plays the latest jazz; the best eggs are sold by the Red Quanders; and gospel rules at the Strangers Rest Baptist Church.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is the black Midwest of the 1950s, when towns could count their white folks on one hand&amp;mdash;the years before the Civil Rights movement came along and changed everything. In perfectly cadenced vernacular, Maxine Clair speaks to us through the voices of Rattlebone&#39;s citizens: October Brown, the new schoolteacher with a camel&#39;s walk and shoulder-padded, to-the-nines dresses; Irene Wilson, naive and wise, who must grapple with her parent&#39;s failing marriage as she steps eagerly into adulthood; and Thomas Pemberton, owner of the local rooming house, an old man with a young heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sparkling with lyricism, Clair&#39;s interconnected stories celebrate the natural beauty of the Midwest and the dignity and vitality of these most ordinary lives. &lt;I&gt;Rattlebone&lt;/I&gt;, winner of the Heartland Prize for fiction, is a tremendous work by a supremely talented writer, now available for the first time in digital form.&lt;/div&gt;" />
