  <title>A Little Touch of Greed - William B. Franklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A short story of manipulation and subterfuge with greed being the driving force. 
Charles, a philanthropist in a way, wins a great deal on the lotto. After looking after his charities and other special interests, he decides to do some travelling to places he always wanted to see. However, on his travels, there is one important ingredient missing, and that is to have someone to share it with. 
Enter Jade, a strikingly beautiful young woman who shares Charless interest in travel, and within a short time, they get married. He buys her all she wants, and still she wants more. His life becomes very unhappy with Jade, compounded by a pain in his side, which, after a visit to his doctor, is diagnosed as cancer. 
Devastated, he finds the nearest park to sit in and pour out his grief. As he is about to put his head into his hands, his attention is diverted to a young woman, not beautiful in the sense as Jade but beautiful in her own right, propelling herself in a wheelchair with a lovely smile on her face greeting all and sundry. He forgets his troubles and is determined to find out who she is. On finally meeting her, he finds out she is a violinist whose ambition in life is to form her own group. He now knows he has a purpose in life, and so the tail unfolds. 
And Jade? Well, there is a twist in the tale for her." />
