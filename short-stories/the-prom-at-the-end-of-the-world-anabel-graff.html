  <title>The Prom at the End of the World - Anabel Graff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The prom is a matter of life or death for every high school girl.
Especially if it corresponds to the last day of life &amp;ndash; on Earth.
In Jenny&#39;s small town the Apocalypse hasn&#39;t sparked panic: mothers and daughters have focused on finding dresses of the right colors for the prom. And Jenny has decided to accommodate this general frenzy, even if she couldn&#39;t care less about the prom, and she would prefer to spend her remaining time reading and squeezing her eyes shut, until she sees the stars.
But she doesn&#39;t, because at the end of the day you should give the impression to your parents that they are doing something that makes you happy, even if they get the opposite effect. because even adults are human beings, especially those who seem inhuman. And even if you feel like crap in your peach pink dress, the prom could be fun. Or something like that.
