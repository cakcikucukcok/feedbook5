  <title>The Buried Life - Wayne Luckmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The stories and sketches offered by author Wayne Luckmann in &lt;i&gt;The Buried Life&lt;/i&gt; offer a unique and intimate perspective of how people respond to the challenges they encounter in the conditions of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of the tales are set against the background of events during the 1940s and 1950s, other pieces in this collection develop from initial incidents in a culture that has changed over several decades resulting in crises for the people involved and are often resolved in unexpected ways. The vignettes revolve around a variety of storylines and introduce a wide range of characterstwo men who escape a gathering mountain storm in a surprising way; a narrator who meets a being totally oblivious to the busy excitement of Paris; a man who faces the dilemma of choosing between positions at a national level or remaining in one locally that will offer him more money and more responsibility; and another man working to accept the pain of betrayal and a dissolving marriage as he restores an antique auto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering a moving collection of stories, &lt;i&gt;The Buried Life&lt;/i&gt; explores the themes of suffering, dealing with memories, and the stinging regrets of the past.&lt;/p&gt;" />
