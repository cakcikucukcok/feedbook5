  <title>Tales of Protection - Erik Fosnes Hansen, Nadia Christensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Four enthralling tales about chance, by the author of &lt;i&gt;Psalm at Journey&#39;s End&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tales of Protection&lt;/i&gt; is a novel about people in different places in different epochs -- contemporary Norway, nineteenth-century Sweden, and Renaissance Italy -- whose stories are bound together by the author&#39;s original and searching inquiry into why things happen the way they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the book opens, a dead man lies in his coffin reflecting on the past. Bolt was an eccentric scientist who devoted his old age to a vast research undertaking -- collecting random incidents from the history of the species and finding the underlying pattern that connects them. This kind of hindsight, after all, must be a kind of heaven -- or a kind of hell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His reveries lead him to tell two other tales -- the tale of a doomed lighthouse keeper on a Swedish island and the tale of rivalry among Renaissance artists -- and finally to tell a startling tale from his own early manhood. All of the tales, in his exquisitely suspenseful narration, demonstrate his theory of &quot;seriality,&quot; which is the opposite of causality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erik Fosnes Hansen&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Psalm at Journey&#39;s End &lt;/i&gt;was acclaimed as one of the most original works yet about the sinking of the Titanic. In Norway, &lt;i&gt;Tales of Protection&lt;/i&gt; has been called a &quot;Blixenesque&quot; masterpiece; it is a major new work of world literature, and a great leap forward for this gifted young writer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
