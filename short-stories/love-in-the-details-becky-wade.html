  <title>Love in the Details - Becky Wade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holly ended things to give him a better life, but she was the future he&amp;rsquo;d always dreamed of.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight years have passed since Holly last saw her high school sweetheart, Josh. Now the wedding of Josh&amp;rsquo;s best friend has brought him back to Martinsburg, Texas.&amp;nbsp; His duties as best man and Holly&#39;s as the church&#39;s volunteer wedding coordinator link them together.&amp;nbsp; As they work behind the scenes to plan a beautiful November wedding for their friends, they&#39;re forced to confront painful reminders of what might have been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holly broke up with Josh all those years ago in an attempt to ensure his future success. However, she never told him the true reason behind her actions and now must decide whether to keep her secret hidden. &amp;nbsp;She&#39;s terrified of letting herself fall for him because she barely managed to piece her life back together after losing him the last time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a day&#39;s gone by since Josh parted from Holly that he hasn&#39;t thought about her.&amp;nbsp; The pain of the past eight years has been too much to bear and he doesn&#39;t want to make himself vulnerable to her again. But the more time he spends with her, the harder it is to deny the love he still has for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Josh and Holly risk their hearts on the hope that God&#39;s timing really can be best? &lt;/p&gt;" />
