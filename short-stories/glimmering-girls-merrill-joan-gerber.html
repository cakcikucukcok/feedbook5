  <title>Glimmering Girls - Merrill Joan Gerber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Glimmering Girls tells the story of three extraordinary American women during a time of sexual and cultural repression.  Francie and her friends Liz and Amanda are college students, coming of age intellectually, emotionally, and physically in a setting where men were forbidden entry to women&amp;#8217;s dorm rooms, and women were locked into those rooms after curfew. College life for women was governed by one simple, cardinal rule: Marry Before Graduation or Be Lost Forever. Any thirst for adventure was supposed to be satisfied by the occasional panty raid.  Francie and friends, however, find all this hard to swallow, and they resist their appointed futures as elementary school teachers and holders of the precious &amp;#147;MRS&amp;#8221; degree. Francie yearns to be a writer and is encouraged by her Russian literature professor. Then she meets Joshua, a talented and dedicated piano student, who presents the ultimate challenge: does she maintain her &amp;#147;virtue,&amp;#8221; or give in to her sexual desires, finally breaking fully free of repressive &amp;#147;respectability&amp;#8221;?  Glimmering Girls follows Francie, Liz, and Amanda through this and other discoveries and adventures. Ultimately, each finds a way to live fully at a time when their entire culture seemed arrayed against them.&lt;/div&gt;" />
