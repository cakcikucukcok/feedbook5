  <title>The Spot - David Means</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Spot is an old blacksmith shed in which three men tweeze apart the intricacies of a botched bank robbery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spot is a park on the Hudson River, where two lovers sense their affair is about to come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spot is at the bottom of Niagara Falls, where the body of a young girl floats as if caught in the currents of her own tragic story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spot is in the ear of a Manhattan madman plagued by a noisy upstairs neighbor . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spot is a suburban hospital room in which a young father confronts his son&#39;s potentially devastating diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spot is a dusty encampment in Nebraska where a gang of inept radicals plot a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spot draws thirteen new stories together into a masterful collection that shows David Means at his finest: at once comically detached and wrenchingly affecting, expansive and concise, wildly inventive and firmly rooted in tradition. Means&#39;s work has earned him comparisons to Flannery O&#39;Connor (&lt;i&gt;London Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;), Alice Munro, Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac (&lt;i&gt;Newsday&lt;/i&gt;), Hemingway, Sherwood Anderson (&lt;i&gt;Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Tribune&lt;/i&gt;/NPR), Denis Johnson (&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;), Poe, Chekhov, and Carver (&lt;i&gt;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&lt;/i&gt;), but the spot he has staked out in the American literary landscape is fully and originally his own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
