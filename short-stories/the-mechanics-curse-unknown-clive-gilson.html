  <title>The Mechanics Curse - Unknown, Clive Gilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Mechanic&amp;#39;s Curse brings together Clive Gilson&amp;#39;s collected short stories in a single volume. These stories have been previously published in anthologies and online magazines. Clive&amp;#39;s love of magical realism from writers such as Angela Carter, and the glories of traditional folk and faery tales shines through. These stories in particular mix the macabre and the fey and tradition with a loving touch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are intimate tales, focusing on broad but subtle themes and personal recollections. Clive Gilson&amp;#39;s stories continue to link recurring themes of fantasy with urban and future decay &amp;ndash; splintered glass, dust motes and cracked plaster; the loss of loved ones, of the ability to remember; black and white movies of the mind; shafts of golden light shattered by war; haunted memories and the night darks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a poetic lilt to the narrative, that delights in the minutiae of observation, bringing the mundane into the spotlight, giving it a meaning and beauty that is mostly lost on us busy ones; there is the terror of the ordinary, the shadow in the midday sun; and then there is the humour: sharp, cynical, painfully astute.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clive Gilson&amp;#39;s stories reverberate in the mind, long after they&amp;#39;ve been read. They connect us in their telling, because we relate to these deep, dark moments of human emotion that make us who we are. These are, indeed, black and white movies for the mind..." />
