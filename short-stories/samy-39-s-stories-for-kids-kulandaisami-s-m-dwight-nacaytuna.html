  <title>Samy&#39;s Stories for Kids - Kulandaisami S.M., Dwight Nacaytuna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If animals in children&#39;s stories could talk and walk, why can&#39;t they post letters, too? THE JUNGLE LETTERBOX, one of the 25 titles in this Book, tells you all about it.  
 What could be a funnier misadventure than this one of a man who steps on the leg of a sleeping street dog and then bends to touch the animal&#39;s body to say sorry as it wakes up growling? This happens to KUPPANDI, the hero of A FUNNY MISADVENTURE. 
	While filling out a Karate class admission application form for a boy, his neighbour puts the kid&#39;s birthtime height and weight against the relevant query simply because the information to be furnished comes next to date of birth of the applicant!  &#39;HEIGHT AND WEIGHT&#39; is that story.
	Want to know about planned escapes, daring self-rescues, eccentric ideas of cheapness and of buying platform tickets for rail passengers arriving with train tickets, crazy notion about faulty gear stick in a bus, etc.? You may find a lot of such like funny and thrilling happenings in stories like A PLANNED ESCAPE, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN,  KUPPANDI&#39;S FIRST BUS RIDE, KUPPANDI BUYS FOUR PLATFORM TICKETS, RAJA PLANS HIS OWN RESCUE, KUPPANDI&#39;S IDEA OF CHEAPNESS, PARROT IN A SWING, MURUGAN&#39;S DARING ESCAPE, etc.!" />
