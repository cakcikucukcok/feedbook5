  <title>Exodus into Evil - Stanley J. Brzycki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Evil lurks among us. In the blackness of a moonlit forest, a wolf howls. In the dank space of a cluttered basement, something hides in shadow. In your own backyard, a hungry creature wants to kill you. This is the world of &lt;i&gt;Exodus into Evil,&lt;/i&gt; a collection of short stories that will take you wandering down a bloody path.
Have you ever felt nervous during a job interview? Thats your body telling you to run, as in the short story, The Chair. Want to know if witches really fly around on Halloween? Discover the truth in November First. Think tumbleweed are harmless, dried plants, rolling through the desert? Keep thinking thatuntil one of them bites off a foot in Tumbleweeds.
Each story has one thing in common: something bad is coming, and evil is on its mind. The sheriff might think hes setting off to help his townsfolk, but the path is never straight in the world of evil. The artist may think a friendly bloodsucker is a creative inspiration, but his work may end up more twisted than he could imagine. Beware the creature in the shadows; sooner or later, it will come for you!" />
