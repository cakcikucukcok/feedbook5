  <title>The End of the Moment We Had - Toshiki Okada, Sam Malissa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two brilliant, multi-layered stories from the winner of the Kenzaburo Oe Prize: part of our Japanese novella series, showcasing the best contemporary Japanese writing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two stunning tales by novelist-playwright Toshiki Okada, characters stagger and thrash, bound by a generational hunger for human connection. On the eve of the Iraq War a couple find unexpected deliverance -  fleeting and anonymous - at a love hotel. And wheels spin as a woman aches for something more from her husband, even as she knows she has enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snapshots of moments high and low, these stories introduce us to an unsettlingly honest voice in contemporary Japanese fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toshiki Okada&lt;/strong&gt; is a hugely admired playwright, director and novelist. Born in Yokohama in 1973, he formed the theatre company &quot;chelfitsch&quot; in 1997. Since then he has written and directed all of the company&#39;s productions, practising a distinctive methodology for creating plays, and has come to be known for his use of hyper-colloquial Japanese and unique choreography. His play &lt;i&gt;Five Days in March&lt;/i&gt;, on which the first story in &lt;i&gt;The End of the Moment We Had&lt;/i&gt; is based, won the prestigious Kishida Drama Award. His works have been translated into many languages around the world. &lt;/p&gt;" />
