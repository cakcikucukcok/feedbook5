  <title>Outside the Window - Julie Roys, Ivan Agustin, JoelRay Pellerin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nelly is a simple, ordinary girlthat is, until late one strange night, when she just happens to be lying awake in bed. On this night, while looking out her window, Nelly sees a shadow. She decides to go to her window to see whats casting the shadow and meets Ockleberry. He is a Wigglemot, a small troll who lives under a scraggly bush on the far edge of Nellys garden. Though surprised to meet such a creature, Nelly accepts Ockleberry as her new friend, and they soon set off on their first adventure. 
On their adventure, Nelly and Ockleberry meet another garden creature. Pigglewit is a Nongbat who lives in the big tree just outside Nellys yard. The three become friends and agree to meet again soon. 
But Nelly, Ockleberry, and Pigglewit are meeting in secret. When Pigglewit and Ockleberry realize that they cant keep sneaking off without their parents permission, they decide to organize a meeting over tea. Garden creatures generally try to hide from big people. Will the new friends be allowed to continue playing with her, or will Ockleberrys and Pigglewits parents think its just not safe?" />
