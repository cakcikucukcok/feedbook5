  <title>Maximum Selling - Jeff Gardner, Shawn Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The book titled &lt;em&gt;Maximum Selling: Bob and Robs 
  Journey to Sales Success&lt;/em&gt; is an outstanding book for developing and strengthening 
  your selling skills immediately. There are two key advantages why this book 
  is an absolutely necessity for anyone that wants more sales and for those who 
  manage people who want more sales. First, the book addresses each aspect of 
  the sales process in the exact progression that will maximize your opportunity 
  to win and keep new business. Secondly, the book is written in a story format 
  about two salespeople who want to sell more, a great deal more, but do not know 
  how. Bob and Rob take the sales journey that will ensure their success for a 
  lifetime. The book is funny, easy to read, and the tools you will learn can 
  be used the moment you put the book down, which of course you will not want 
  to until you finish the last page (with its own unique ending). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maximum Selling&lt;/em&gt; will literally put in your hands the 
  tools and specific techniques needed to accelerate you to your own maximum level 
  of sales performance that you truly are capable of achieving. Find out how Bob 
  and Rob take the journey of examining their own confidence levels and learn 
  how to self manage the behaviors that will lead to their own success. Discover 
  a goal setting method that will blow the doors off of anything you have seen 
  before. Realize how to effectively prospect, uncover hidden needs of the buyer, 
  and present superior selling solutions. Negotiate through objections and gain 
  commitment with greater ease than you thought you could obtain. These are just 
  some of the insights you will gain by reading this one of a kind book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Here is what Brian Tracy, one of the worlds most renowned 
  sales development and motivational specialists and author of &lt;em&gt;Focal 
  Point, Advanced Selling Strategies, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Maximum Achievement,&lt;/em&gt; had 
  to say about &lt;em&gt;Maximum Selling: Bob and Robs Journey to Sales Success:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;This book gives you a step-by-step process you can apply 
  immediately to make more sales, faster, and easier than you ever imagined possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Make the investment in yourself, buy and read &lt;em&gt;Maximum Selling: 
  Bob and Robs Journey to Sales Success.&lt;/em&gt; Your pocket book will thank 
  you.&lt;/p&gt;
