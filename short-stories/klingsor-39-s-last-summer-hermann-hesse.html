  <title>Klingsor&#39;s Last Summer - Hermann Hesse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the first English-language edition of &lt;i&gt;Klingsor&#39;s Last Summer&lt;/i&gt;, which was originally published in 1920, a year after &lt;i&gt;Demian&lt;/i&gt; and two years before &lt;i&gt;Siddhartha&lt;/i&gt;. The book has three parts: a story called &lt;i&gt;A Child&#39;s Heart&lt;/i&gt;, followed by &lt;i&gt;Klein and Wagner&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Klingsor&#39;s Last Summer&lt;/i&gt;, Hesse&#39;s two longest and finest novellas. These novellas, along with &lt;i&gt;Siddhartha&lt;/i&gt; (the three works were republished in 1931 under the title &lt;i&gt;The Inward Way&lt;/i&gt;), are the first fruits of the period that began in the spring of 1919, when Hesse settled in the Ticino mountain village of Montagnola to start a new life without his wife and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Child&#39;s Heart&lt;/i&gt;, written in January 1919, in Basel, concerns the transmutation of a boy&#39;s innocence into knowledge of good and evil, and the painful guilt that accompanies this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;i&gt;Klein and Wagner&lt;/i&gt; (written in May-June 1919, immediately after the arrival in Montagnola) and &lt;i&gt;Klingsor&#39;s Last Summer&lt;/i&gt; (written shortly after) are set in a southern landscape that reflects Hesse&#39;s life that summer; both novellas have heroes who are more or less Hesse&#39;s age at the time; and in both the hero&#39;s death is preceded by a grand vision of unity in which the polarities of life are resoluved. Hesse exposes himself mercilessly in &lt;i&gt;Klein and Wagner&lt;/i&gt;, a story of escape, wrenching loose, letting go. But the expressionist painter Klingsor is a more direct self-portrait of the Hesse of 1919.&lt;/p&gt;" />
