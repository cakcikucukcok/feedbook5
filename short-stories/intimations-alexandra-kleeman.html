  <title>Intimations - Alexandra Kleeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the celebrated author of &lt;em&gt;You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine&lt;/em&gt;,a thought-provoking, often unsettling story collection that consists, broadly, of narrative diagrams of the three main stages in a human life: birth, life, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexandra Kleeman&amp;#8217;s debut novel &lt;em&gt;You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine&lt;/em&gt; earned her comparisons to Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo, Ben Marcus, and Tom Perrotta. It was praised by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; as &quot;a powerful allegory of our civilization&amp;#8217;s many maladies, artfully and elegantly articulated, by one of the young wise women of our generation.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her second book, a collection of twelve stories irresistibly seductive in their strangeness, she explores human life from beginning to end: the distress of birth into a world already formed; the brief and confusing period of &quot;living&quot; where we understand what is expected of us and struggle to do it; and the death-y period toward the end where we sense it is ending and will end only partially understood, at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title is taken from one of the stories (&quot;Intimation&quot;), but is also a play on Wordsworth&#39;s &quot;Intimations of Immortality&quot;&amp;#8212;only in this case it&amp;#8217;s not clear exactly what is being intimated, but it&amp;#8217;s nothing so gleaming and good as Immortality. The middle, &quot;Living&quot; section of the book, is fleshed out with a set of stories that borrow more from traditional realist fiction to illustrate the inner lives of the characters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At once familiar and mysterious, these stories have an eerie resonance as its characters find themselves in new and surprising situations. An unnamed woman enters a room with no exit and a ready-made life; the disappearance of people, objects, and memory creates an apocalypse; the art of dance is used to try to tame a feral child; the key to surviving a house-party lies in knowing the difference between fake and real blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elegant, surprising, wondrous, and haunting, &lt;em&gt;Intimations&lt;/em&gt; is an utterly transporting collection from one of our most ingenious and brilliant young writers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
