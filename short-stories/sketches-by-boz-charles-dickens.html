  <title>Sketches by Boz - Charles Dickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charles Dickens (1812-1870) was an English short story writer, dramatist, essayist, and the most popular novelist to come from the Victorian era. He created some of the most iconic characters and stories in English literature, including Mr. Pickwick from &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, Ebenezer Scrooge from &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, David Copperfield, and Pip from &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, to name a few. Dickens&#39; began by writing serials for magazines, and from 1833-1836 he used the pseudonym Boz, taken from a childhood nickname for his younger brother. &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot; contains 56 stories and, like most of Dickens&#39; work, vividly portrayed the lives of Londoners around him in an effort to illustrate social injustices and promote reform. Unlike less successful writers of the time who divided whole works into serialized episodes, Dickens often gauged public reaction to each installment, allowing himself to tailor the plot accordingly. This collection is divided into four sections: &quot;The Parish,&quot; &quot;Scenes,&quot; &quot;Characters,&quot; and &quot;Tales.&quot;" />
