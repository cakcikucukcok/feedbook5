  <title>Awake When All the World Is Asleep - Shree Ghatage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is the mid-seventies, and Shaila has returned to Bombay for her father&#39;s sixtieth birthday party. In the linked stories that follow, Shree Gatage renders an India that can only be revealed by first leaving, and then returning again -- in the end, for Shaila, for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this highly accomplished first collection, Ghatage reveals a true gift for bringing sparkling characters to life: A young woman who was orphaned in adolescence finally comes to recognize and accept what it is to be loved; a mother in search of an acceptable husband for her daughter rejects one boy because his sister leads her life by the number five; fate keeps a man from continuing his family line when each of the women he marries dies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whole rich world opens up as Ghatage lovingly articulates the minutiae of daily life in India&#39;s urban south in this lively, humorous, poignant collection.&lt;/p&gt;" />
