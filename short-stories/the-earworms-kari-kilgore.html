  <title>The Earworms - Kari Kilgore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Estonoa, Virginia. A lovely little town tucked deep in the Blue Ridge Mountains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hiking and ATV trails. Kayaking along the scenic Clinch River.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A thriving community focused on the future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Erin Evans loves her hometown, except for one thing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Earworms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Will Erin find the answer before the music drives her and everyone else crazy?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;An excerpt from&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Earworms&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;What if your&amp;nbsp;whole town had to face the music?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Erin hunched her shoulders. No one else was out on the street, no vehicles moving. Just a few short weeks ago, even this early in the day people would be walking, chatting, doing a bit of shopping before the afternoon heat settled in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The middle of the street could be the worst depending on how the songs played out that day. Sometimes all of Estonoa sounded one annoying tune, from nowhere and everywhere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes each block was different.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More and more often, each building, sidewalk, and parking lot was infected with its own variety of musical torture. Even the hiking trail by the river and the town park had joined in the constant onslaught.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Erin gritted her teeth as chirpy Nineties pop battled campy Sixties TV. She hopped over brand new white lines on 4th Avenue, amazed at what she was willingly headed toward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The theme from&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Gilligan&amp;rsquo;s Island&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;finally won out." />
