  <title>Prerequisites for Sleep - Jennifer L. Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Prerequisites for Sleep&lt;/i&gt;, her first published short story collection, Jennifer L. Stone has created a fictional world rich with dilemmas. From the young unwed mother paying the price for both her own mistakes as well as her family&#39;s, to the woman whose unexpected late-in-life pregnancy wreaks havoc on her relationship with her teenaged daughter, to the man who finds a mysterious woman taking over his kitchen and his life, to the elderly woman trying to balance dignity with aggression management in her relationship with her Alzheimer-stricken husband, all the characters in the thirteen stories of this collection must make decisions and compromises that invite insomnia. Although most of these characters are firmly rooted in Stone&#39;s Maritime landscape, their challenges are universal. They are people we recognize. They step off the page alive as family, friends, and neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;" />
