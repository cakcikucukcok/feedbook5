  <title>The Faded Tapestry - Christy Burkley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From a mysterious, fading, historical tapestry to a fish that speaks to a confused, grief-stricken boy, author Christy Burkley offers wickedly comical tales of eccentrics who collide with the limits of reality in &lt;i&gt;The Faded Tapestry: A Collection of Short Stories&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Escape, an old woman must find a way out of her miserable existence. At first she thought that living with her forty-seven-year-old daughter Virginia in St. Louis, Missouri, would be better than a nursing home, but the brick apartment building where she now resides is no better than a prison cell. Her only wish is that she be buried in Tennessee, a wish that her daughter deems too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexican Invasion tells the story of May Sanderson, a loyal cleaning lady for the well-to-do, charitable Mrs. Taylor. May begins to have doubts when Mrs. Taylor brings a Mexican family on board to help revive the farm. When something bad happens to one of the children, May isnt sure how to react.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A compilation of eight fictional tales, &lt;i&gt;The Faded Tapestry: A Collection of Short Stories&lt;/i&gt; presents casts of characters who come alive through their words and actions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
