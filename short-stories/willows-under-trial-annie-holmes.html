  <title>Willows Under Trial - Annie Holmes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Several plays have been composed into novels of short stories. This began the saga of Beneath the Willow. The first book in the series focused on several of the residents of the established settlements.  After many years of hard work, the town began to flourish.
When they initially settled, all residents were in one central location. They spread out as the town began to grow.  Development of farms and pastureland advanced rapidly.
The town of Willow Bend is filled with imaginary characters but implies a very realistic concept.  It is the writers vision that the town was established in the 1870s.  
Horace Lee Crowley and seven hundred migrants braved the elements, traveling until they found what they later established as the Willows.  It was divided into several settlements: Willow Bend, Willow Estates, Willow Grove, and Willow Creek.
The people tilled the soil and made their own clothing.  For a short length of time, everyone cooked on a huge open pit.  They prayed, inspired, encouraged, and made unified efforts together to lighten the load of chores of one another.  They suffered the hardship of floods, crop infestation, poor farming equipment, and loss of profits.  Through it all, unity blended them together as a community. After many years of hard work, the town flourished. Disagreements were natural in personality differences but were short lived.
They migrated from a sharecrop farm thirty miles away. They tread large bodies of water that sometimes rose above waistlines.  Small children were placed upon mens shoulders or on one of the old mules. Women carried the bundles of food and what little clothing they owned.  It was a rough going, but majority of the people endured it. They had small clippings of flowers, twigs from fruit trees, and roots from vegetables. The substance of their existence was on their backs, mules, and wooden trestles that the men fashioned.  Scraps of wood and small trees made up the trestles.  This was the beginning of the Willows.
Once settled, many differences occurred, natural in personalities, but they were able to accomplish agreement with the help of the county judge.  The drama was getting to that point.
Thanks for reading. See what you would do in these cases." />
