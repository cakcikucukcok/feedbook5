  <title>Remnant Stew - Tristan MacAvery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;This first collection of Tristan &lt;span
class=SpellE&gt;MacAvery&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; short works spans over two decades of humor,
experience, passion, and wonder. Here are tales of a lady who still speaks to
unicorns; of a writer who finds a muse that&#39;s a bit more than he bargained for;
of a pair of space pilots, drinking one last toast to each other before their
respective planets go to war; of a town whose people live only to build and
rebuild the wall which surrounds their ever-shrinking land; of an office temp
who discovers that his boss just might be the very devil to work for; and of
aliens who try to mate with Volkswagens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;There is food for thought here
also, ranging from the comedy of breaking a toilet while being attacked by a
religious icon, to the drama of trying to rescue a drug-crazed young man from
his suicidal cravings. Essays discuss everything from the relative worth of
Henry David Thoreau&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Walden &lt;/i&gt;to the modern world, to an entire political
platform that has something to offend just about anyone who has lost hold of
his common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Remnant Stew: A tasty dish to set
before anyone with an appetite for excellent writing.&lt;/p&gt;
