  <title>Love on a Deadline - Kathryn Springer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They&amp;rsquo;ve helped orchestrate the perfect day for countless couples. Now twelve new couples will find themselves in the wedding spotlight in the second Year of Weddings novella collection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MacKenzie thought writing wedding stories was beneath her journalistic abilities. Until one love story rekindled an old flame and opened her heart to love once more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacKenzie &amp;ldquo;Mac&amp;rdquo; Davis left her hometown of Red Leaf, Wisconsin, ten years ago, and she never looked back. But when her father, beloved Coach Davis, suffers a mild heart attack, she returns home for an extended visit. It means taking a job at the local newspaper, where the biggest news story is the return of Hollis Channing to marry her celebrity fianc&amp;eacute;, but Mac would do anything to make sure her dad takes care of himself. She just didn&amp;rsquo;t know that would include spending extended time with her high school crush, Ethan Channing, brother of the bride and the boy who broke her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ethan Channing offered to help his sister plan her fast wedding, he had no idea what a big production it would be. Nor what a dilapidated state their old family home would be in. But when he catches Mac trying to take pictures of the house for an article she&amp;rsquo;s writing, he ropes her in to helping him. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe the tomboy coach&amp;rsquo;s daughter he remembers from high school has turned into this beautiful fire ball of a woman. And he has to admit he doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind needing her help in planning the wedding of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been ten years since they&amp;rsquo;ve seen each other. And ten years is a long time. But is it long enough to repair broken hearts and turn old high school crushes into love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
