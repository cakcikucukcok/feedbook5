  <title>My Ramblings - Buddy Oxendine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book started as silly writings on Facebook that blossomed from there to what you see here.  All my stories are made up and fictional but have some real characteristics, like people do drive, people do shop, etc.  As you will see, they are written in the first person and I make myself the idiot, hero or whatever else one might call me.  I referenced Starbucks simply because they are the most widely known coffee shop in the world.  That story is also fictitious. My stories are not meant to be prejudicial toward any ethnic group.  I have no desire to offend anyone. I wrote a silly story and people responded very positively and said they wanted more.  After writing several stories I received responses about the possibility of compiling all my stories into a book.  Of course, I laughed and thought that was silly, but the response was so overwhelming that I began to seriously consider it.  A few close friends and family members suggested that I had nothing to lose, so I gave it serious thought.  Finally, I was convinced, although grudgingly, to contact a publisher and see what happened.  It is still silly to me, but if my friends on Facebook want it, I will make it available.  The expense of making this book possible is small compared to the joy I hope it brings to my loyal readers.  Enjoy the read and by all means, let me know what you think." />
