  <title>A Place in Time: Twenty Stories of the Port William Membership - Wendell Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;For more than fifty years, Wendell Berry has been telling us stories about Port William, a mythical town on the banks of the Kentucky River, populated over the years by a cast of unforgettable characters living in a single place over a long time. In this new collection, the author&amp;#8217;s first piece of new fiction since the publication of Andy Catlett in 2006, the stories date&amp;#8217;s range from 1864, when Rebecca Dawe finds herself in her own reflection at the end of the Civil War, to one from 1991 when Grover Gibbs&amp;#8217; widow, Beulah, attends the auction as her home place is offered for sale. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It feels as if the entire membership, all the Catletts, Burley Coulter, Elton Penn, the Rowanberrys, Laura Milby, the preacher&amp;#8217;s wife, Kate Helen Branch, Andy&amp;#8217;s dog, Mike, nearly everyone returns with a story or two, to fill in the gaps in this long tale. Those just now joining the Membership will be charmed. Those who&amp;#8217;ve attended before will be enriched.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The story of the community of Port William is one of the great works in American literature. Published in the author&amp;#8217;s 78th year, this collection, the tenth volume in the series, is the perfect occasion to celebrate his huge achievement.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;And so it&amp;#8217;s all gone. A new time has come. Various ones of the old time keep faith and stop by to see me, Coulter and Wilma and a few others. But the one I wait to see is Althie.  Seems like my whole life now is lived under the feeling of her hand touching me that day of the sale, and every day still.&lt;BR&gt;  I lie awake in the night, and I can see it all in my mind, th old place, the house, all the things I took care of so long. I thought I might miss it, but I don&amp;#8217;t.  The time has gone when I oculd do more than worry about it, and I declare it&amp;#8217;s a load off my mind. But the thoughts, still, are a kind of company.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;              -- Beulah Gibbs&lt;/div&gt;" />
