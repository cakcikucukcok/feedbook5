Later, the Coroner would be unable to fix that time more precisely than between six and ten o&#39;clock. Newspapers, reporting that he had sailed off without crew, used terms which pictured Charles as a hardy loner. Anyone who knew him smiled at this.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So begins Widows, with the loss of the wealthy husband whom Dorothy Laird had caught, by playing her cards faultlessly, for marriage to the beautiful Elizabeth, her one child.
