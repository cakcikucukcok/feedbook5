  <title>The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories - Leo Tolstoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most known for &quot;War and Peace&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina,&quot; considered two of the greatest novels in world literature, Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) also penned numerous novellas and short stories which remain valuable classics in their own regards. &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories&quot; collects six of Tolstoy&#39;s finest short stories into one edition. In &quot;How Much Land Does a Man Need?,&quot; Tolstoy explores this very question through the story of a peasant with an increasing appetite for land—an appetite which becomes his ruin. &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilyich,&quot; one of Tolstoy&#39;s short masterpieces, tells of the early death of a high-court judge in 19th century Russian. &quot;Family Happiness&quot; explores the female identity within changing romantic relationships. Narrated in first person by the female protagonist Masha, the tale is a skilled and engrossing story of woman&#39;s difficult position in a shifting society. &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot; is an intense tale of love, marriage, sex, and jealousy. Initially banned by the Russian censors, the novella has inspired many films, theater productions, and paintings. In &quot;The Devil,&quot; two brothers struggle with a new inheritance riddled with debts when sudden romance and lust threaten to turn his world upside down. Lastly, &quot;Father Sergius&quot; tells of a young aristocrat who, upon discovery of his fiancé&#39;s infidelity, retreats into the life of a monastic Orthodox Christian, though this radically new life proves to be difficult." />
