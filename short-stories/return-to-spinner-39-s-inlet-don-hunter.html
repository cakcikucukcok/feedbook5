  <title>Return to Spinner&#39;s Inlet - Don Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A collection of connected short stories set in a fictional town in BC&#39;s Gulf Islands where attitude is everything, and everybody has one.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years &quot;Spinner&#39;s Inlet&quot; was a beloved serialized newspaper column created by Don Hunter that ran in the &lt;i&gt;Province&lt;/i&gt;, Vancouver&#39;s newspaper. Eventually, Hunter compiled the columns and turned them into &lt;i&gt;Spinner&#39;s Inlet&lt;/i&gt;, the bestselling book published in 1989. Now, thirty years later, Hunter is revisiting the quirky inhabitants of this fictional coastal community, who are ready to entertain a brand-new generation of readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the cast of characters has evolved, Samson and Rachel Spinner are still around, suitably older and possibly a little wiser, as are some of the more familiar faces from this fictional village in BC&#39;s Gulf Islands, where attitude is everything and everybody has one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A humorous read that&#39;s perfect for fans of Jack Hodgins, Bill Gaston, and Pat Carney, &lt;i&gt;Return to Spinner&#39;s Inlet&lt;/i&gt; will have you chuckling with recognition.&lt;/p&gt;" />
