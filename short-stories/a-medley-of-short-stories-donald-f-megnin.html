  <title>A Medley of Short Stories - Donald F. Megnin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Between the first and last series of stories the reader will find an amalgam of thoughts, experiences, maturation, and influences which have affected the life of the author. While some of the stories are humorous, tragic, rancorous or filled with questions the reader might ask himself/ herself, it is hoped that a new set of insights have been provided to give meaning to their lives. What drives persons to question their beliefs, growth, human examples and what has produced the type of person he/she has become?
Everyone has grown up with persons who have influenced them more than they knew at the time of their encounter. It may only be years later that they may recognize who, what, and why they have experienced the vagaries of life unique to themselves. Even as a person&#39;s finger prints are unique and so uniquely differentiated that there are no two sets of finger prints alike among human beings, each one of us has his/her own unique lifetimes which no one else may have had. There are segments of a person&#39;s life which may resonate in terms of experiences, persons, events and places truly unique to themselves, but unduplicated in the same forms as those of their neighbors.
A Medley of Short Stories attempts to illustrate how unique the totality of a person&#39;s life can be from beginning to end: from birth to death, from childhood to adulthood, from tragedy to success depending upon what a person makes of the lifetime experiences which everyone has but not everyone can turn to his or her advantage.
It is the hope of the author to provide an insight and stimulus to the reader&#39;s reevaluation of his/her life which will assist in evaluating the heights and depths to which their own lives have evolved or are evolving in the course of their lifetimes.&quot;" />
