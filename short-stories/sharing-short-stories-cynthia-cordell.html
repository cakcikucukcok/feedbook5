  <title>Sharing Short Stories - Cynthia Cordell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Paint a picture of a familiar character, and chances are youll encounter that person in this collection of short stories. This anthology abounds with the funny, positive things that come up in life. The wonder of short stories can motivate you to investigate all that life has to offer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sparkling short stories by Cynthia Cordell are a great way to spend your time curled up on the sofa or bed with a steaming cup of chamomile at your side. The majority are slices-of-life vignettes; peeks into the lives of ordinary people going about their business, and then, surprise!  the occasional sci-fi story thrown in to add a bit of contrast and allow Ms. Cordell to show the ease with which she can change genres. The stories are a brilliant mix of the intricacies of computer programming and website design juxtaposed with makeup and hair issues and quite a lot of the love of food. The masculine and the feminine combined  and a mix Ive never encountered as a reader before. Get your copy and get your tea ready! Highly recommended!&lt;/p&gt;
