  <title>Transgressions - Lawrence Block, John Farris, Stephen King, Walter Mosley...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Forge Books is proud to present an amazing collection of novellas, compiled by New York Times bestselling author Ed McBain. Transgressions is a quintessential classic of never-before-published tales from today&#39;s very best novelists. Featuring: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Walking Around Money&quot; by Donald E. Westlake: The master of the comic mystery is back with an all-new novella featuring hapless crook John Dortmunder, who gets involved in a crime that supposedly no one will ever know happened. Naturally, when something it too good to be true, it usually is, and Dortmunder is going to get to the bottom of this caper before he&#39;s left holding the bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hostages&quot; by Anne Perry: The bestselling historical mystery author has written a tale of beautiful yet still savage Ireland today. In their eternal struggle for freedom, there is about to be a changing of the guard in the Irish Republican Army. Yet for some, old habits-and honor-still die hard, even at gunpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Corn Maiden&quot; by Joyce Carol Oates: When a fourteen-year-old girl is abducted in a small New York town, the crime starts a spiral of destruction and despair as only this master of psychological suspense could write it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Archibald Lawless, Anarchist at Large: Walking the Line&quot; by Walter Mosley: Felix Orlean is a New York City journalism student who needs a job to cover his rent. An ad in the paper leads him to Archibald Lawless, and a descent into a shadow world where no one and nothing is as it first seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Resurrection Man&quot; by Sharyn McCrumb: During America&#39;s first century, doctors used any means necessary to advance their craft-including dissecting corpses. Sharyn McCrumb brings the South of the 1850s to life in this story of a man who is assigned to dig up bodies to help those that are still alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Merely Hate&quot; by Ed McBain: When a string of Muslim cabdrivers are killed, and the evidence points to another ethnic group, the detectives of the 87th Precinct must hunt down a killer before the city explodes in violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Things They Left Behind&quot; by Stephen King: In the wake of the worst disaster on American soil, one man is coming to terms with the aftermath of the Twin Towers--when he begins finding the things they left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Ransome Women&quot; by John Farris: A young and beautiful starving artist is looking to catch a break when her idol, the reclusive portraitist John Ransome offers her a lucrative year-long modeling contract. But how long will her excitement last when she discovers the fate shared by all Ransome&#39;s past subjects? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Forever&quot; by Jeffery Deaver: Talbot Simms is an unusual cop-he&#39;s a statistician with the Westbrook County Sheriff Department. When two wealthy couples in the county commit suicide one right after the other, he thinks that it isn&#39;t suicide-it&#39;s murder, and he&#39;s going to find how who was behind it, and how the did it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Keller&#39;s Adjustment&quot; by Lawrence Block: Everyone&#39;s favorite hit man is back in MWA Grand Master Lawrence Block&#39;s novella, where the philosophical Keller deals out philosophy and murder on a meandering road trip from one end of the America to the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
