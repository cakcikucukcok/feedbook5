  <title>Satire of the Sadly and Seriously Suggested Strychnine Spiked Stylisation - Evan Scarlett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Well, some may call it satire, but like with most things in life, poor Mr. Scarlett seems to make it almost a poisonous and bitter observation of the human condition. Sick people may think that he is funny, but unfortunately, there are many out there who, if were given a single brain cell, would be terribly lonely and will not be laughing at all.
Most people do not take enough care and attention to the things that happen around themthe wool that gets pulled over their lives with the propaganda and brain washing machine that they live inso they get tumbled around in the machine of life&#39;s events and are too lazy to look for the end-of-cycle button.
So please forgive this poor prick, but he feels the people of the world need a kick up the arse and he mistakenly thought that with his disgusting words he may achieve this." />
