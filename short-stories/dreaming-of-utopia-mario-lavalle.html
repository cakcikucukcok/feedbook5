  <title>Dreaming of Utopia - Mario Lavalle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cyrus is the youngest castaway in Utopias history. Although his situation could have been avoided, Cyrus now feels helpless and trapped in an unknown world where there may be only one way back home. Now alone on a boat in the middle of a vast sea, Cyrus must learn to rely on himself and the contents of a single backpack in order to survive his nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After zombies overrun a city in a matter of days, the closest thing to patient zero is in the heart of the city. As a group of soldiers pulls out all the stops in a brave attempt to stop the kamikaze zombies, all they can do is hope they survive the Day of Zed. Unfortunately their mission may be harder than they think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a prisoner is strapped to a gurney, all he can do is hope that he is provided a better attorney in the after-life. While Carl, who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and within the right circumstances, faces the inevitable, he discovers that sometimes it is just too late for justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreaming of Utopia shares three gripping short tales that reveal the challenges of diverse characters as they bravely face what lies in front of them and learn to surrender to fate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
