  <title>Pangs of an Entomologist - Dr. Debashis Biswas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In India, mosquito control activities have traditionally bee running under the administrative control of doctors who have no or very little knowledge about the subject. For reasons best known to them, doctors are deadly against deployment of entomologists in their department. 
A highly qualified entomologist of Beldanga Municipal Corporation,Dr  Animesh Munda, wanted to work independently to prevent malaria and dengue. But the doctors of the corporation bulldozed his aspiration for their own benefit. The professional career of Munda was cribbed by the medical fraternity. He was insulted. He was abused. He was ridiculed. Upcoming entomologists, proactive political leaders, social activists, health ministers and the mass may find this book worth reading. Pangs of an Entomologist is all about the unexpressed pain, unshed tears and unreached voice of Munda. Munda joined BMC about 24 years ago as an entomologist. He still works there as an entomologist. And he will retire from BMC as an entomologist. Adorned with the Universitiy&#39;s esteemed degree of PhD, Munda works in BMC as a draftsman following the instructions of doctors." />
