  <title>The Faith of Jude (Ghost Hunters Mystery-Detective) - S. H. Marpel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;There were seven of them now, and they controlled enough online systems to decide the fate of humankind - forever.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jude was minding her own business, enjoying the weather at 7,000 feet, a breeze in her hair.&lt;br /&gt;
For an immortal spirit-guide, she could simply phase from here to there instantly, but she liked to fly. Just her, no plane. A little energy shield against the wind and weather (otherwise her clothing soils and her hair gets &amp;quot;ratty&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
Someone or something showed up next to her and matched her speed. A sort of glow. Tracked with her for miles. Danced with her in the sky.&lt;br /&gt;
She paused. And &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; took the opportunity to talk to her.&lt;br /&gt;
Its question was simple. Her help was needed. Humankind needed a lawyer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It was on trial - for its existence...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I was minding my own business when they found me, flying among the clouds without an airplane.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the perks of being an immortal spirit-guide. I could always simply &amp;quot;phase&amp;quot; from here to there instantly, but I liked to fly. Easier than any bird. I only put a little energy shield against the wind and weather (otherwise my clothing soils and my hair gets &amp;quot;ratty&amp;quot;). But it let the fresh air through (although I heated it a little if it got too cool.)&lt;br /&gt;
The day was fantastic. Bright sunshine streamed through the cloud gaps, and the arbitrary divisions in the land ownership below made a varied patchwork of the land. Different crops, tillage, and wilder areas were always interesting to look over from a &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;how come&amp;quot; viewpoint. Much like John wrote his stories.&lt;br /&gt;
And that was where I was headed, to his little writer&amp;#39;s cabin in the Midwest. I had some time off, and enough so I could luxuriate in this slow method of travel.&lt;br /&gt;
For all the history I&amp;#39;d lived through, it still pointed out that the more things changed, the more they stayed the same. Humans hadn&amp;#39;t changed much in 10,000 years, if at all. And even those of us who&amp;#39;d managed to &amp;quot;evolve&amp;quot; into spirit-beings, we were still very much the humans that we&amp;#39;d started out as. Older, more experienced - but &amp;quot;wiser&amp;quot; was whether we really wanted to learn from all that experience.&lt;br /&gt;
And I&amp;#39;d get twinges of sadness reflecting like that. Because not all of the spirit-guides I&amp;#39;d known had made it. Like gods and goddesses - just because you&amp;#39;re immortal doesn&amp;#39;t mean you can&amp;#39;t be killed.&lt;br /&gt;
About the time I was musing about this, someone or something showed up next to me, some dozen feet away, and matched my speed. It appeared to me like some sort of glow. I blinked to make sure nothing had gotten in my eyes, or it was a refractive glint or something.&lt;br /&gt;
It just stayed with me. I increased speed, then decreased speed. It was still there. I did barrel roles, loops, dives, stopped in mid-air. And it kept up and duplicated everything.&lt;br /&gt;
Except when I moved closer. Then it just waited for me.&lt;br /&gt;
So I stopped, about six feet away, and asked, &amp;quot;Somebody in there?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
The pendant on my chest, hanging from a woven thong around my neck, started pulsing. And then became the speaker for this light.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well, hello. No, not exactly &amp;#39;in there&amp;#39;, but you&amp;#39;re right - there&amp;#39;s somebody here.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Does this &amp;#39;somebody&amp;#39; have a name?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Call me Al. Others are listening in, but I&amp;#39;ll be the voice you can talk to.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Who are you folks?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
