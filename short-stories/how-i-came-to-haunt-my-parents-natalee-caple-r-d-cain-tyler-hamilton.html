  <title>How I Came to Haunt My Parents - Natalee Caple, R.D. Cain, Tyler Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How I Came to Haunt My Parents is storytelling for parents on the verge of a nervous breakdown. In this beautifully written suite of short fiction Natalee Caple explores fables from the dark side of adulthood and imagines what moral Aesop may have offered to a mother who gave birth to a murderous dictator. Caple&#39;s animals and humans are imbued with modern complexity as they confront sex, death, and history, but her stories are as witty as they are profoundly lucid.
How I Came to Haunt My Parents is proof of Caple&#39;s status as one of the great prose stylists currently writing. 
Praise for Natalee Caple
&quot;Moving?unsettling.&quot; -The New York Times on The Heart Has Its Own Reason
&quot;A brilliant story-teller.&quot; -D.M. Thomas, author of The White Hotel
&quot;Natalee Caple writes with sensual and captivating detail of people whose dreams drive them to unanticipated extremities.&quot; -Catherine Bush, author of The Rules of Engagement" />
