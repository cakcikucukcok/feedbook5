  <title>Under My Window - Navid Sorkhou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sammi is a car salesman, a family man, and an addict. Bored with his personal life, Sammi spends ridiculous amounts of money on women, booze, and drugs. Unfortunately now Sammi cannot endure long without a hit of something from his dealer, Luci. But little does he know that the high he desperately seeks will eventually lead him to seal his fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constable Johnson is a police officer who has just pulled over a car thief. Fully Loaded, as he is called on the street, is not just another pretty face. He is a law school graduate who gets a rush from stealing cars. Johnson hates to draw his gun. But when he does, what happens next will surprise everyone. As their granddaughter, Homa, looks on, Ahmadi and Bandar have an animated discussion under a window. Homa is fascinated by her grandfathers, especially when they talk about their home country, Iran. As the men continue, they have no idea another is listening, learning, and contemplating his own life from the window above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Under My Window&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of stories that reflect sacrifices made for love as diverse characters attempt to find purpose and discover that perfection is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
