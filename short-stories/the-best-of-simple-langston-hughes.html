  <title>The Best of Simple - Langston Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Langston Hughes&#39;s stories about Jesse B. Semple--first composed for a weekly column in the Chicago &lt;i&gt;Defender&lt;/i&gt; and then collected in &lt;i&gt;Simple Speaks His Mind&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Simple Takes a Wife&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Simple Stakes a Claim&lt;/i&gt;--have been read and loved by hundreds of thousands of readers. In &lt;i&gt;The Best of Simple&lt;/i&gt;, the author picked his favorites from these earlier volumes, stories that not only have proved popular but are now part of a great and growing literary tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple might be considered an Everyman for black Americans. Hughes himself wrote: &quot;...these tales are about a great many people--although they are stories about no specific persons as such. But it is impossible to live in Harlem and not know at least a hundred Simples, fifty Joyces, twenty-five Zaritas, and several Cousin Minnies--or reasonable facsimiles thereof.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Arnold Rampersad has written, Simple is &quot;one of the most memorable and winning characters in the annals of American literature, justly regarded as one of Hughes&#39;s most inspired creations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
