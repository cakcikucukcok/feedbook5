  <title>The Dinner Party - Joshua Ferris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; Notable Book of the Year: The first collection of short stories from the critically acclaimed, prize-winning author of &lt;i&gt;To Rise Again at a Decent Hour&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; These eleven stories by Joshua Ferris, many of which were first published in The New Yorker, are at once thrilling, strange, and comic. The modern tribulations of marriage, ambition, and the fear of missing out as the temptations flow like wine and the minutes of life tick down are explored with the characteristic wit and insight that have made Ferris one of our most critically acclaimed novelists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Each of these stories burrows deep into the often awkward and hilarious misunderstandings that pass between strangers and lovers alike, and that turn ordinary lives upside down. Ferris shows to what lengths we mortals go to coax human meaning from our very modest time on earth, an effort that skews ever-more desperately in the direction of redemption. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There&#39;s Arty Groys, the Florida retiree whose birthday celebration involves pizza, a prostitute, and a life-saving heart attack. There&#39;s Sarah, the Brooklynite whose shape-shifting existential dilemma is set in motion by a simple spring breeze. And there&#39;s Jack, a man so warped by past experience that he&#39;s incapable of having a normal social interaction with the man he hires to help him move out of storage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The stories in &lt;i&gt;The Dinner Party&lt;/i&gt; are about lives changed forever when the reckless gives way to possibility and the ordinary cedes ground to mystery. And each one confirms Ferris&#39;s reputation as one of the most dazzlingly talented, deeply humane writers at work today." />
