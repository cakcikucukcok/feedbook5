  <title>The Crowded World of Solitude Volume 1 - Albert RUSSO</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WORLD LITERATURE TODAY: 
Albert Russos collected stories included in this hefty volume constitute an excellent testimony on the writers ability to create fiction which is both entertaining and thought-provoking in a surprising variety of contexts.  All of Mr Russos readers know that he can write as easily about his native Africa as about present-day New York or Italy; and the collection, with stories set in different places and milieus, highlights his special talent at transporting his readers from one scene to another, in a kind of sentimental journey through human experience.  Science fiction and fantasy are other paths trodden by Albert Russo in his quest for a pre-Babel reconciliation of man with himself in all his constitutive dimensions, linguistic and social, but also generic and transcendental.
