  <title>Wildflower - Debasree Ghosh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Like the Wild Flower that grows in the wild, in the valley and in the meadow and  atop a hill  or floats on the river,  poetry as well as the stories grew from within me naturally  they are not implants from without . The urge to write was natural, arising out of my experiences in life and how they  got entwined with my emotions   my  trepidations like the first  time when I as a child hesitantly neared the water front and dipped my foot into the cold icy water, how these  struck a chord within me and urged me to express my feelings. Slowly like the way a flower matures, the onslaught of varied experience moulded my thoughts and inspired  my poetry. It  continued to articulate my joy of unfurling the curtains of perception and sharing the joy of  living and sometimes the pain that came with it. 
Life has so much to offer and often so much to take away from us all . Our convictions, our doubts, our joy and our sorrow  all of them blend together in our quest for that ever eluding meaning such feelings hold for us -and what could be more beautiful and more lyrical  than to express our innermost thoughts  through  poetry. Like they say, poetry is magical!" />
