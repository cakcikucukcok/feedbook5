  <title>This Is Not Your City - Caitlin Horrocks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How can a first book arrive with such advanced understanding of all the beautiful and sometimes shaded echelons of hope in which we live our lives? Caitlin Horrocks is a stunning writer and these stories mark a brilliant debut. She knows language and she knows people and I am grateful for this book.&quot;&amp;#151;Ron Carlson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven women confront dramas both everyday and outlandish in Caitlin Horrocks&#39; &lt;I&gt;This Is Not Your City&lt;/I&gt;. In stories as darkly comic as they are unflinching, people isolated by geography, emotion, or circumstance cut imperfect paths to peace&amp;#151;they have no other choice. A Russian mail-order bride in Finland is rendered silent by her dislocation and loss of language, the mother of a severely disabled boy writes him postcards he&#39;ll never read on a cruise ship held hostage by pirates, and an Iowa actuary wanders among the reincarnations of those she&#39;s known in her 127 lives. Horrocks&#39; women find no simple escapes, and their acts of faith and acts of imagination in making do are as shrewd as they are surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Caitlin Horrocks &lt;/B&gt;lives in Michigan, by way of Ohio, Arizona, England, Finland, and the Czech Republic. Her stories have appeared in The Best American Short Stories 2011, The PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories 2009, The Pushcart Prize XXXV, The Paris Review, Tin House, and The Southern Review. Recently, she won the $10,000 Plimpton Prize from The Paris Review. She teaches at Grand Valley State University.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
