  <title>On The Road from Burns - Ted Haynes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Road from Burns&lt;/em&gt; brings to life a still remote part of the American west.&amp;nbsp; In sixteen stories dating from 1853 to 2039, Ted Haynes presents fascinating characters facing the wide open opportunites of this beautiful land.&amp;nbsp; We meet pioneers, Indians, scoundrels, lumber camp women, and even aliens who love to ride horses.&amp;nbsp;The stories in range in style from humorous to sad, from suspense to romance, and from realistic to imaginative. In &amp;quot;Bridges&amp;quot; a rancher rides two days with his young son to see the 1911 engineering marvel of a railroad bridge being built 320 feet above the Crooked River. In &amp;quot;Do No Harm&amp;quot; a frontier doctor in La Pine outsmarts a gang of outlaws. A golfer encounters a very strange tournament on an impossible golf course in &amp;quot;Local Rules&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Fatal Errors&amp;quot; tells the story of a man who witnesses an attempted murder and lives to regret that he said nothing about it. In &amp;quot;Prisoner of Conscience&amp;quot; an Italian POW escapes from a camp near Sunriver to live in the forest and climb Mt. Bachelor. The older man in &amp;quot;Living Well&amp;quot; must find, with the help of his wife, a way to relate to a grown-up daughter he never knew existed. The stories are told by a rich variety of narrators - men, women, third party, and omniscient. A great introduction to the storytelling potential of the vast and rapidly growing territory of Central Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
