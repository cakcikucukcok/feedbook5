  <title>Toby Tuttles and the Lost Temple - David Chantala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the first episode, The Enchanted Vanishing Sword, Toby was befriended by an old wizzard who showed him how to pass through a secret portal connecting his world with a world in the fourth dimension called Duppland. Toby, even though just a teenager, impressed the people of Duppland with his courage and wisdom concerning supernatural forces that the people of this land feared. Toby developed many special friends in this land and would go visit them from time to time, being careful not to let anyone see him pass through the secret portal.
 In this episode, Toby is summoned by the Governess of Duppland, Lady Zelda, to rescue his best friend Rain. She is being held captive in a secret temple and is to be sacrificed in three days to a hedious living stone monster created by the evil warlock, Dr Zodd. It is believed that once you enter the temple the only way out is through a very dark maze where the stone monster lurks. If somehow you get past the monster and find the way out of the dark maze you must get past a wicked giant who has been chosen by Dr Zodd to guard the exit and is not to let anyone leave the maze alive.
 No one in Duppland knows where the temple is or how to find it. It is believed that an old hermit living somewhere in the badlands of Axmar, knows a way to find the temple, but first you need nto find him. Armed with only a bag of dirt and a staff Toby sets out on his quest to save his friend.
 The way is long and dangerous. Toby has many bone chilling encounters with vicious mongols, man eating plants and huge flying reptiles. Once inside the temple he must find Rain, destroy the stone monster, find the way out of the dark maze and defeat the giant guard posted there. Next they must pas through a series of burning lava pits and deadly lava snakes, then make their way back to Duppland, crossing the giant wastelands of mercer where they encounter a hedious looking dragon that Toby must slay to save Rain from being eaten. Finally they get a ride back to Duppland on a unicorn where they receive a heros welcome." />
