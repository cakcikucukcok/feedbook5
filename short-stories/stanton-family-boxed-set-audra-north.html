  <title>Stanton Family Boxed Set - Audra North</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lose yourself in four steamy novellas and meet the men of the Stanton family, who will melt your heart and scorch your sheets. Let author Audra North show you the passion and swoon-worthy romantic love that only the sexy Stanton men can deliver. This special edition boxed set features all four of the beloved Stanton Family novellas for one low price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find your perfect love with just one click.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Falling for the CEO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finance genius Meredith Klaus prefers numbers to people, especially around the holidays. At least the large sum of money that&#39;s mysteriously vanished from the company accounts will distract her from the ghosts of Christmases past. Until her sexy boss asks her to be his last-minute date to a fundraiser gala, that is. A beautiful dress. A handsome man on her arm. A challenge she can&#39;t refuse. Can Meredith and Andrew find the missing money and fulfill their holiday wishes, or will Meredith be unable to overcome the demons of her past and lose her chance at happiness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One Night in Santiago&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily Stanton&#39;s vacation goes from bad to worse when a storm strands her in a foreign country, arguing with an arrogant--and very sexy--stranger over the last available hotel room. Successful CEO Bruno Komarov wasn&#39;t expecting the gorgeous woman checking in at the reception desk to challenge him over a room. Even more surprising, he actually enjoys their exchange. Lily proposes a compromise--she&#39;ll take the bed and he can sleep on the couch.  It&#39;ll be strictly business. After all, what could possibly happen in just one night?&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Lesson in Temptation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Harkness pulled himself out of poverty to become one of the world&#39;s most respected finance professors, but his personal life is non-existent. When he gets roped into a dance class, of all things, he doesn&#39;t expect it to change his life. Julie Stanton&#39;s hard work has paid off with her career, but finding the same happiness in the rest of her life is a challenge. When her former professor, the one she had a crush on in college, shows up at the same dance class, their tango becomes more than a dance; it becomes a lesson in how to love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Healing Her Heart&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Greg Stanton is looking for ways to de-stress in the aftermath of losing a patient, and getting hot and heavy with Carrie Jankowski sounds like just what he needs to forget his high-stress life for a while. He doesn&#39;t have time for anything long-term--his only focus is and has always been the well-being of the patients whose lives are in his hands. But when Carrie accepts his straightforward terms of a no-strings relationship, they realize too late that they won&#39;t be satisfied with sex alone...&lt;/p&gt;" />
