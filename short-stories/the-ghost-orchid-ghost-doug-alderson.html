  <title>The Ghost Orchid Ghost - Doug Alderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Florida’s famous swamps—from the Everglades to Mosquito Lagoon to Tate’s Hell—serve as fitting backdrops for these chilling original stories. Maybe it’s because they are often wet, shadowy places of wild beauty where few people dare to penetrate. They are havens for snakes, alligators, black bears, wildcats, and who knows what. People on the run have often hidden in swamps, while others have gotten lost in the watery expanses; the swamp can be a refuge or a nightmare. Mysterious things just happen in swamps. Maybe it’s because they are often wet, shadowy places of wild beauty where few people dare to penetrate. They are havens for snakes, alligators, black bears, wildcats, and who knows what. People on the run have often hidden in swamps, while others have gotten lost in the watery expanses; the swamp can be a refuge or a nightmare. Where else can you find a ghost baby, or an angry specter, or a lost soul? How about a ghost who is obsessed with the ghost orchid, or an alluring snake woman? Throw in a skunk ape or two and you’ve got the ingredients for many entertaining hours sharing these stories around a campfire or reading them to yourself or out loud. &lt;p&gt;From the Author’s Notes at the end of each story, you can learn a thing or two about Florida’s swamps, creatures, and history, along with storytelling tips. Florida is rich in history, natural beauty, and ecological and cultural diversity. To protect what is special about our state it is important to educate the people who live here and our visitors. In this unique book you&#39;ll find tales of mystery and intrigue interwoven with important facts and lessons of natural history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who but a naturalist can really scare you about what lurks in the swamp? Doug Alderson has been there and knows. In writing tales for this book, Doug Alderson drew upon many years of entertaining young people as a summer camp counselor and storyteller, and also from decades as a swamp explorer. He is a former associate editor of Florida Wildlife magazine. To learn more about his writing and photography, check out his website at www.dougalderson.net.&lt;/p&gt;" />
