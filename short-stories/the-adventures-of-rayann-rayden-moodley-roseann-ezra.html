  <title>The Adventures of Rayann &amp; Rayden Moodley - Roseann Ezra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rayann (Annie) and Rayden Moodley are two incorrigible little children that are always getting themselves into some sort of adventure.
Be it from the head-spinning, dizzy heights of Disneyland Paris to the heart-wrenching tears of being ripped away from home, school, and friends, with the uncertainty of what their tiny futures hold, right down to the stepping into a brand-new future for both of them and their parents.
Each day of their adventures have fun-filled, hair-pulling moments that leave one laughing hysterically whilst waiting with bated breath for their next exploit.
Thrown dead centre in the middle of their craziness is their very calm, very patient mum, who has the task of making sense of their days whilst wiping tears and acting as referee.
Welcome to the adventures of Rayann and Rayden Moodley. It will leave you wanting more." />
