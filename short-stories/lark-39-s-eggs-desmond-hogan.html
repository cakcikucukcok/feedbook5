  <title>Lark&#39;s Eggs - Desmond Hogan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Des Hogan is, and has always been, the real thing - a writer of great originality, dramatic flair, linguistic invention - who remakes the world every time he puts pen to paper.&#39; Neil Jordan. Desmond Hogan is one of most remarkable literary talents to have come out of Ireland in the past half-century. Larks&#39; Eggs affirms that stature. Here, with twenty-two classic stories taken from earlier collections and twelve fresh narratives, Hogan displays anew his lyricism, compassion and sheer prismatic brilliance. His subject is exile and self-image, explored through isolates and eccentrics, brittle lives trapped by poverty, personal histories and restless identities, giving a voice to those on the margins -Travellers, the misplaced, the dispossessed. Describing &#39;The Airedale&#39; in William Trevor&#39;s The Oxford Book of Short Stories, Cressida Connolly wrote: &#39;it is profound, moving and exquisitely executed. Hogan is one of the finest writers alive today and deserves to be much better known.&#39; In the Times Literary Supplement, Joyce Carol Oates called &#39;Winter Swimmers&#39; an &#39;elegiac, daringly sustained prose poem; a collage of meticulously rendered Irish scenes that weaves in and out of tales of tinkers and youths&#39;. The San Francisco Chronicle remarked: &#39;Desmond Hogan&#39;s mastery of language and characterization rivals that of Flannery O&#39;Connor and Anton Chekhov; never has the psychological landscape of the exile been rendered with such incisive, haunting prose.&#39; Larks&#39; Eggs&#39; compelling tales of diaspora are both global and local, telling of subsumed identity and allurement, of past merging with present through landscape and mindscape. Desmond Hogan&#39;s fragmented personas are repositories for childhood memory and a collective unconscious that is distinctly Irish and history-burdened, while exhilaratingly and wholly universal and modern. &#39;Here&#39;s to the storytellers. They made sense of these lonely and driven lives of ours.&#39; The Lilliput Press is proud to reintroduce one of Ireland&#39;s most evocative prose writers. Desmond Hogan takes his place alongside Joyce, Plunkett, Trevor, O&#39;Faolain, Kiely and McGahern.&lt;/div&gt;" />
