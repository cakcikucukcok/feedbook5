  <title>Handyman - Sexy erotica - Marianne Sophia Wise, Martin Reib Petersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I quickly turned my head and saw her standing behind the middle window in the living room, staring out at me. She came out soon after, still in her kimono with the flamingos. She handed me a glass of ice water. I put the glass to my mouth and envisioned her naked body.&quot;
Henry is employed on a drilling rig in the North Sea. He works 12 consecutive hours a day, every day, for 14 days. After the two weeks he goes back to the mainland for a break, to spend time with his friends and bachelor-colleagues. He spends his nights with women, pleasuring them and letting his emotions run free. In the morning, he says goodbye. His rule is simple: a new woman every night. Only once does he make an exception. Her name is Clara.
This short story is published in collaboration with the Swedish filmproducer Erika Lust. Her intention is to depict human nature and diversity through stories of passion, intimacy, lust and love in a fusion of powerful stories and erotica." />
