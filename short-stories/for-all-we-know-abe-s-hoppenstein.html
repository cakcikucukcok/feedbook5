  <title>For All We Know - Abe S. Hoppenstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book (fiction) tells an engaging original story an epic sweeping drama with&lt;BR&gt;
character driven pictures&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspDuring the 1930s Baron Jacques Chavalmont the wealthy and respected&lt;BR&gt;
President and Chief Executive of an infl uential private merchant bank in Paris&lt;BR&gt;
became concerned by developments in Germany and meticulously crafted a plan&lt;BR&gt;
for the survival of his extended family should a war ensue.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspThe Plan required the transfer of substantial assets  bullion, currencies, 
art and&lt;BR&gt;
jewelry for safekeeping in the Barons Bank (The Bancario di Milano) in Buenos&lt;BR&gt;
Aires. The Baron arranged for his ambitious son-in-law Caetano di Rosario to&lt;BR&gt;
manage the Bancario.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspThe book narrates how its characters a disparate group of talented men and&lt;BR&gt;
women from Italy, Germany, Latvia, and Entre Rios (Argentina): Caetano Di&lt;BR&gt;
Rosario, his wife Marie-Helene, their son Alain, Max Elman and his paramour&lt;BR&gt;
Francine, Dr. Manfred Lowen, and Kathleen McCloud (from Entre Rios) converged&lt;BR&gt;
on Buenos Aires during the 1930s. It relates their dreams, hopes, frustrations,&lt;BR&gt;
passions, romances, adultery, greed and dishonesty.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspIt describes how the new Buenos Aires residents successfully adapted to 
their&lt;BR&gt;
new environment and how their lives interacted over time against the backdrop of&lt;BR&gt;
events (leading to and after the Second World War) which took place in England,&lt;BR&gt;
France, Germany, Monte Carlo, Latvia, Israel and Buenos Aires.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&lt;B&gt;The immigrants never saw their loved families again Most had perished&lt;BR&gt;
in the Holocaust&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspAfter the end of the Second World War a small group of European family&lt;BR&gt;
survivors sued Caetano di Rosario and the Bancario in Buenos Aires for the recovery&lt;BR&gt;
of their families deposited assets. The fully described litigation process culminated&lt;BR&gt;
in a most interesting denouement that directly aff ected Caetano, Marie-Helene,&lt;BR&gt;
Alain, Kathleen, Manfred and Sandra&lt;BR&gt;" />
