No one knew about the court-ordered sessions that Kyron was forced to attend. At least not until Mari, his woman who stuck by him throughout the majority of his prison bid, dropped the recordings off to Trae Macklin, Tasha&amp;rsquo;s husband.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mari never got closure over Kyron&amp;rsquo;s death. She couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand why Kaylin wasn&amp;rsquo;t more distraught than he was over his brother&amp;rsquo;s death. Her anger built over Tasha using Kyron, and now, seeing Tasha was happily reunited with her husband, it was about to explode. She had it all. But that was soon to come to an end. Her happily-ever-after would be short-lived. Mari had in her possession transcripts of taped sessions of Kyron and the psychologist, unbeknownst to Kyron, which would shed light on Tasha&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Kyron&amp;mdash;and with an anaconda smile, she places those transcripts directly in Trae&amp;rsquo;s hands for his consumption. Mari has a few dirty tricks up her sleeve. Nothing&amp;rsquo;s off-limits. What other nasty surprises is she planning?&lt;/p&gt;" />
