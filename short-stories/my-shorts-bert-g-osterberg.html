  <title>My Shorts - Bert G. Osterberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ranging from dark tales of vampires and serial killers to tongue-in-cheek science fiction to comedy and farce, My Shorts, by author Bert G. Osterberg, shares an eclectic collection of short stories centering on life, death, and laughter.
The Option was written while Osterberg contemplated his past. High School was inspired by a plot twist in Tchaikovskys opera, The Queen of Spades, and recalls his own tortured high school career. To Amerikay calls on his love of history as told in the stories of ordinary people who do extraordinary things. Three Views shares Osterbergs political statement. Netties Triumph was penned for his granddaughter to illustrate when she was in grade school. And My Aunt Ruth tells about this feisty woman who lived in Michigan all of her life.
From a suspenseful story of a dark castle in Transylvania to a fanciful encounter with a wonderfully strange fifth grade teacher, this collection of tales entertains and often challenges conventional ideas and notions." />
