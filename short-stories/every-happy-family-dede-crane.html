  <title>Every Happy Family - Dede Crane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Humorous and heartbreaking, wise and demented, &lt;i&gt;Every Happy Family&lt;/i&gt; explores the colourful – and sometimes repurposed – fabric of the Wright family. The stories mark turning points in the lives of the individual family members, as well as in their relationships with each other. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Married parents Jill and Les are the warp of the Wright family tapestry - Jill beginning to lose her mother to Alzheimer&#39;s, Les diagnosed with a cancer he initially keeps secret from their children. Each family member&#39;s thread unravels from the others, as older son Quinn finds a dangerous way to combat shyness, younger son Beau seeks success and closure at boarding school, and adopted daughter Pema explores her roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But past and present weave back together and towards the future, as everyone is called home for Les&#39;s &quot;life celebration&quot; - his &quot;living wake&quot;. Alone and together, the Wrights crash along, unable to give up on themselves or each other...hard as they might try.&lt;/p&gt;" />
