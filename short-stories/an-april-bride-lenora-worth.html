  <title>An April Bride - Lenora Worth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A year&amp;rsquo;s worth of novellas from twelve inspirational romance authors. Happily ever after guaranteed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War changed everything . . . even their love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bride-to-be Stella Carson cannot wait another day to marry her longtime sweetheart, Marshall Henderson. But her plans fall to pieces when she receives the terrible news that Marshall has suffered a near-fatal head wound while serving overseas. Diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, he asks to recover privately in a D.C. hospital, and Stella gives him space to heal. But when Marshall returns home to Louisiana, it becomes clear to them both that he is not the man he used to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marshall&#39;s memories of home have disappeared, and he suffers from violent, vivid nightmares night after night. Struggling to regain their life together, Stella reintroduces him to their town, reminding him of his history and their love story and watching glimpses of recognition dance in his eyes. But there is one dark corner in his memory, one important part he can&amp;rsquo;t remember: his life with Stella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With only weeks until the wedding, Stella and Marshall must choose between a marriage built on the past and faith in long-ago love or a very different future than the one Stella imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As a romance writer, there&#39;s nothing more exciting than writing about a wedding. I was a March bride, so writing a wedding set in the same month was perfect.&quot; &amp;mdash;Rachel Hauck, author of &lt;em&gt;A March Bride&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
