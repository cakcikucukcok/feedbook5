  <title>New Crossroads - Suhail Ali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;ONE THING IS CERTAIN IN LIFENO ONE CAN ESCAPE THE WAVES OF SURPRISE AND CHANGE. IN &lt;i&gt;NEW CROSSROADS&lt;/i&gt;, SUHAIL ALI OFFERS A DELIGHTFUL COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES THAT PROVIDE INTERESTING GLIMPSES OF THE LIVES AND EXCITING TIMES OF A NEW GENERATION IN INDIA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie is the prettiest nurse at a research hospital in New Delhi, but she desperately wants to lose weight. When she learns that patient Babu Ram lost twenty pounds in ninety days, she begins an inquiry that leads her to discover the shocking secret that instigated Babus journey to a special diet. Mohan Rao is a retired professor of history at a leading university in Hyderabad. When his son refuses to honor his wishes, Mohan must face the reality of his own past. Bhakteshwar Prabhu is a hostel warden and an important man to everyone associated with New Engineering College. Now, he must interview his successor - and finds a surprising candidate in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short tales in &lt;i&gt;New Crossroads&lt;/i&gt; capture the mood of a society in transition and reflect on an emerging consciousness shaped by rapid and fascinating social changes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
