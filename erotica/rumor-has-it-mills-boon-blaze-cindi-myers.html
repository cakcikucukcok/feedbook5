  <title>Rumor Has It (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) - Cindi Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Ten years–that&#39;s how long Taylor Reed has been starring in the X-rated rumors that sizzle nonstop through Cedar Creek&#39;s grapevine. What she hasn&#39;t done with Dylan Gates just isn&#39;t worth talking about–so the stories go.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now she&#39;s ready to leave the small town and its even smaller minds, but first she&#39;s going to give the gossips something &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt; to talk about. For once the steamy stories of sex and seduction will all be true….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A chance to make his fantasies about Taylor a reality? Dylan is more than willing. Soon their sexy escapades are hotter than he ever dreamed possible, and he wants to push their relationship beyond the bedroom door. Despite the sizzling passion, Taylor&#39;s determined to keep it an affair. Looks as if he&#39;ll have to prove that he can keep the heat between them long after the town has stopped talking!&lt;/p&gt;
