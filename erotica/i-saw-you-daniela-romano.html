  <title>I Saw You - Daniela Romano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jules, 25, has never been in love with a man until she meets a mysterious man who saves her life. It will be love at first sight, the spark will immediately strike between the two... will the sweet and naive Jules conquer in winning the playboy Dean?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jules is single, is about to graduate and lives in New York with Rachel, the friend of a life engaged with Josh. She dreams of working in the editorial field and meeting the man of her dreams, able to wipe away the insecurities of all time and to grasp her virginity. In fact, she has never been in love and has never had a `serious` story. One day, by chance, a charming boy saves her before being hit by a car. Those impenetrable eyes, able to read the soul and ignite the desire, begin to torment her thoughts. But in a metropolis like New York, how many chances have you to meet the same person twice? Yet fate gives Jules a second chance: the mystery man is called Dean, and he is Josh`s brother. Between the two immediately breaks an uncontrollable physical attraction, but the dark past of Dean does not allow him to let him go, and while he wants to keep the relationship on a purely sexual level, Jules falls in love... An incredible story, a passion able to make people dream and restore trust in the magic of love.&lt;br /&gt;
