  <title>Submitting To Everyone - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nicky&amp;#39;s eccentric and gorgeous new boss has a few demands. First, she must wear only a jacket as she boards a flight to meet him. Second, she must join the mile high club, but she isn&amp;#39;t allowed to come. Third, she must submit completely to the powerful strangers a restaurant with him watching. And he&amp;#39;s not the only one making explicit demands...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was blindfolded in the limo, presumably so I couldn&amp;#39;t make my way back to the mysterious restaurant. Well, joke&amp;#39;s on them. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to find the restaurant even if I wasn&amp;#39;t blindfolded. My sense of direction was practically nonexistent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You must be new,&amp;quot; the driver commented, his accent heavy but not one that I could place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What gave you that idea?&amp;quot; I managed, more than a little worried that I had gotten in the wrong car. It was a little uncomfortable to be sitting in the back of the limo in absolute darkness. My fingers itched to take off the blindfold. It would be so easy. I just needed to pull it off. But I stayed strong and kept the blindfold on the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he asked me to put it on earlier, I thought he was joking. Then, he handed me the black strip of cloth and stared at me to make sure I did it. Trembling a little, I wrapped the cloth over my eyes and tied the knot behind my head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve never seen you before,&amp;quot; he said simply. &amp;quot;And you&amp;#39;re still wearing that jacket.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His words chilled me and I wrapped it around myself even tighter. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s wrong with my jacket?&amp;quot; I asked, more than a little defensive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not going to need it in about ten minutes,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The car came to an abrupt stop after a little while and the door beside me opened ominously.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Can I take my blindfold off now?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He must have nodded because he didn&amp;#39;t make a sound. A moment later, he chuckled and said, &amp;quot;Yes. Take it off please.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cold air made goosebumps raise on my arms. Tentatively, I pulled off the blindfold covering my sight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The restaurant in front of me wasn&amp;#39;t really a restaurant at all. It looked like a palace, , a stark contrast against the shining silver airport we had left behind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I looked around me, expecting to see gravel road and tall trees, but the road was tar and modern and the only thing that separated the passing of time as the restaurant was a lake I didn&amp;#39;t realize we had driven past. Beyond the lake stood high-rise buildings that reflected the mid-afternoon light. I looked away and turned back to the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was so different from everything around it. I couldn&amp;#39;t help but stare at the impressive marvel of architecture in awe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Beautiful, isn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot; the driver asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Breathtaking,&amp;quot; I agreed, climbing out of the car.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll have to take your jacket,&amp;quot; he said, arm extending to do exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; I whirled to him, shock clear in my gaze.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His teeth shone when he grinned. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s the rule,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s cold,&amp;quot; I whispered. Didn&amp;#39;t he know I wasn&amp;#39;t wearing anything underneath?" />
