  <title>Spanked in the Woods - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Claire has made a terrible mistake. Leaving the beaten track, she has wandered into the woods, without realizing that she is trespassing. Caught by three strapping aristocrats, she must pay the price for her transgression.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To begin with, they will spank her, but the three of them want oh so much more than that...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hey - you&amp;#39;re trespassing!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This is our territory!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The shouts were loud enough for me to hear exactly what they were saying, and when I saw that they were brandishing their rifles as they charged towards me, I did what any sensible person would do. Dropping my gloves and the basket, I sprinted away from the men as fast as my legs would carry me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I dashed through the wildflowers and weaved between the trees, sure that my agility would make up for my lack of speed. Perhaps it was that particular thought that doomed me - as soon as I thought that I&amp;#39;d lost them, my foot got stuck in a particularly large tree root, and I came tumbling down to the forest floor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I could hear the loud crunching of the footsteps behind me, and I scrambled to get up. My fall had knocked the wind out of me, but I was certain that I could work myself back to a standing position. My arms struggled to heave my upper body off of the ground, and as soon as I had managed it, I felt something cold and metallic touch the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I gulped." />
