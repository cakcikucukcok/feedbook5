  <title>Lollo Aurelie - Bull Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Kingsfordland, Tennessee, 1937 &amp;mdash; Lollo Aurelie is a city slicker mobster running from trouble up north when he stumbles upon a mountain hick town ripe for a takeover. When moonshiners revolt to his dastardly deeds, they dress him &amp;ldquo;purdy&amp;rdquo; in drag and each of his captors have their way with him on a platform deep in the backwoods. They affectionately call him Priscilla Pumpernickel, a late whore who died drowning on a load.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Look at ol&amp;rsquo; Priscilla Pumpernickel dressed so fuckin&amp;rsquo; purdy in her pink lace,&amp;rdquo; woofed Ralph Waldo Donavon, a jolly redhead redneck with girth, pulling proudly on the straps of his dirty overalls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a crude sight to behold. Both utterly disgusting as it was cock-throbbing arousing, standing back there in those dark mountainous woods by the fleeting moonlight. There was a small measure of me that wanted to turn away from this horrific scene, sensing something much worse was on the bend. The part I was driven by, keeping my feet firmly planted on the Tennessee soil with this scandalous curiosity gnawing away at me, wanted to look on the finale of our plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Whee-wee Priscilla Pumpernickel sho&amp;rsquo; is a purr-dy doll, yes sir,&amp;rdquo; lulled David Oliver, a gargantuan black man with a gruff reddish-brown beard using his crumpled southern drawl to make reference to the local tramp that was strangled to death by a hefty wad of his half-brother Albert&amp;rsquo;s sweet mulatto jizz.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The four other guys standing about continued to laugh heartedly surrounded this odd being slowly coming to with a pair of hairy arms tied behind their back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;F-U-fuckin&amp;rsquo; purdy I tell you!&amp;rdquo; David declared once more, stomping his large heavy boot on the captive&amp;rsquo;s platinum blond wig creating another round of hard mirth among the bearish men. &amp;ldquo;Yes sir, f-u-fuckin&amp;rsquo; purdy!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
