  <title>Daddy Likes It Rough...And So Do I! - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever since she read a book about fathers giving their naughty daughters what they deserve, Melanie has wanted the same.
No longer interested in sex with guys her age, Melanie longs to be punished like the bad girl she&#39;s dying to be. But is resigned to the fact it will never happen.
Then her father walks in on her reading the book and masturbating. Her mother shows up and he covers for her, but tells Melanie she&#39;s staying home from school tomorrow and they&#39;re going to have a long talk.
Melanie thinks she&#39;s in trouble and she&#39;s right, because her daddy has every intention of treating her like one of those bad girls in her book. For Melanie, being bad will never feel so good!
