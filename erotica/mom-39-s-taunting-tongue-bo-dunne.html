  <title>Mom&#39;s Taunting Tongue - Bo Dunne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eighteen-year-old Connor&amp;#39;s date, Gena, takes one look at his manhood and bursts out laughing. She takes pictures with her phone and hurries away. Dejected, Connor goes home but walks in on his mother, who&amp;#39;s with a very well-endowed stranger. Later that night, his mom Mattie learns that Connor saw her. Connor&amp;#39;s devastated and Mattie knows she has to keep his spirits up somehow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mattie, Connor&amp;rsquo;s mother, leaned down to put more beers on the table for a trio of twenty-something guys, and she pretended not to notice how their eyes dropped to her cleavage, revealed in the loose, blue, deep-V pullover. Her 36C boobs were easy to see in a blue lace bra. She was almost old enough to be their mother, but they were semi-regulars who had tipped her well in the past. She hoped her ongoing boob show, plus their beer buzz, would keep their generosity flowing just like the beer. &amp;ldquo;There you go, guys. Will there be anything else?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nah, we&amp;rsquo;re fine,&amp;rdquo; said one guy, without looking up from the deep V revealing her boobs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mattie laughed. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t very tall, and her lack of height emphasized her bust. Her constant walking as a barmaid here at the Grillin&amp;rsquo; Gator Bar kept her short legs toned and shapely. While her butt was bigger than she liked, she knew it still attracted male attention as she walked around the bar and bent over to serve customers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Right now, she knew that a guy named Hank was sitting behind her, almost certainly looking as far up her snug little black skirt as he could. Hank drove through this area a couple of times a year on business and had become a casual friend. Now she straightened up and turned around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hank was still looking down at her bare legs, before he raised his gaze and grinned. &amp;ldquo;Nice to see you again, Mattie. I always think of you when my route&amp;rsquo;s going to bring me this way.&amp;rdquo; His attention dropped back down to her boobs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m flattered. The truth is, I think of you, too.&amp;rdquo; Mattie ran a hand through her short, brown curls, which came from her Irish heritage. She was forty-one years old and had never married. Connor&amp;rsquo;s biological father had just been a one-time hookup." />
