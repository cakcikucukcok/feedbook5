      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Young Carter is very close with his big, family family consisting of his serious, lawyer mother, Angela, his laid-back aunt, Victoria who is also his high school history teacher, his easygoing sister, Lexi who refuses to grow up, his reclusive and hermit sister, Erin, and finally his tough, UFC fighter sister who wants to go pro. He loves them all and does everything he can to make sure they&amp;#39;re happy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Carter decided his mom, Angela would be the first to get his help. His plan was simple, but he thought it would be effective in relieving her stress. It was Saturday, so his mother was off of work, though he knew she would be working on her laptop anyway. Letting the rest of the family know to stay away for the two days, he had ordered a masseuse and scheduled a manicure and pedicure at the local nail shop. Also, he had bought her favorite television show&amp;#39;s blue-ray, along with her favorite snacks to binge watch on Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Making his way to her room, he knocked on the door. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s me. Can I come in?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes. Come in.&amp;rdquo; She answered in a distracted voice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As he thought, she was sitting up on her bed, typing away on her silver laptop. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s up?&amp;rdquo; She asked without looking at him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carter walked over and grabbed the computer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What do you think you&amp;rsquo;re doing?&amp;rdquo; Angela raised her voice, glaring up at him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No working today.&amp;rdquo; He grinned. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re officially a bum for the weekend.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Carter, stop joking around. I have an important case to work on.&amp;rdquo; She reached for the machine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He moved out of her reach. &amp;ldquo;Mom. You look exhausted and you&amp;rsquo;re barely sleeping. At this rate, you&amp;rsquo;re gonna pass out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She went to argue, but Carter spoke again. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve ordered a masseuse to come to the house.&amp;rdquo; He glanced at the laptop&amp;#39;s screen to check the time. &amp;ldquo;She should be here soon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;A massage?&amp;rdquo; Angela gave him a doubtful look. &amp;ldquo;Who is she?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry. She&amp;rsquo;s not from some shady ad on Craigslist or something. My mom&amp;rsquo;s friend works at the massage parlor downtown.&amp;rdquo; He chuckled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hmm&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; His mom still seemed reluctant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And after that, you have an appointment for a manicure and pedicure at the nail shop. Then to finish it all off, tomorrow you&amp;rsquo;re gonna be a model couch potato and binge-watch Controlled Chaos. It finally came out on blue-ray yesterday. And it&amp;rsquo;s all been paid for, so you can&amp;rsquo;t back out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Angela was silent for a moment studying him until a small smile broke out on her face and she sighed. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d be a jerk to refuse all that, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t I?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;A little bit.&amp;rdquo; He smiled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She pointed at him. &amp;ldquo;Fine. But you&amp;rsquo;re watching with me all day tomorrow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You sure? It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be your relaxing day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She nodded. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re the only one in this family who appreciates the masterpiece of Controlled Chaos.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carter laughed. &amp;ldquo;Alright. It&amp;rsquo;s a date then.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
