~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Butterflies were beating their wings in my stomach. Peter wasn&amp;#39;t the only one excited; I was being given permission to flirt with another man, something I hadn&amp;#39;t done in years. Not only flirt, but do it in front of my husband, who would be getting more and more excited the longer I flirted. In the end, I&amp;#39;d get a beautiful dinner and a night at an exclusive hotel. I felt so excited it had to be wrong; I shouldn&amp;#39;t be excited about talking to another man, promising him sexual favors he&amp;#39;d never have. Yet, that&amp;#39;s what my husband wanted more than anything, and I knew how excited it made him, and what I&amp;#39;d get out of it, in the end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I giggled to myself, &amp;quot;in the end.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;d get it, too. I started hoping that some impossibly beautiful businessman would try to pick me up while Peter watched. Maybe my husband would get so excited we wouldn&amp;#39;t even make it to the restaurant, he&amp;#39;d just take me right up to the room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I started preparing with a long, hot bath. I already knew what I was going to wear: a dress designed to excite my husband. On a whim, I also decided to shave myself. I&amp;#39;d already done my legs and, with the help of a pair of scissors, a small mirror, and a fresh blade, I removed all my pubic hair. I thought I&amp;#39;d look like a little girl but when I gazed in the mirror I saw that I looked very much like a grown woman&amp;#39;s. Not only a grown woman, but a sexually aroused one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As I dried off, it became obvious how aroused I was. The whole of idea of flirting with some handsome businessman and then making love with my husband got to me. I was physically ready for Peter right then.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did something I hadn&amp;#39;t done since we married. Rooting around in my bottom drawer, I found my old trusty vibrator. It hadn&amp;#39;t been used in years and I was sure the batteries would be dead, but it sprang to life, and just the feel of those vibrations against my hand brought back memories of secret release I&amp;#39;d enjoyed when I had no other outlet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After wiping it clean with a wet nap and quickly patting it dry, I ran the machine against my freshly shaven mound. The lack of hair increased my sensitivity in ways I hadn&amp;#39;t foreseen, and the vibrations felt wonderful as they touched me. I was hoping for some relief; I was hoping the vibrator would &amp;quot;take the edge off,&amp;quot; so to speak. It didn&amp;#39;t. All I did was excite myself even further, causing a throbbing sensation that would not go away. In fact, it didn&amp;#39;t go away for hours. All that time, I was acutely aware of my own genitals." />
