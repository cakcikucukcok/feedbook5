  <title>A Van Life Fairytale - Mysticalchemist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A woman half his age that wants him to take her away. A stepfather that wants her gone. A mother seeking the life and the father she lost. Scott has a choice in this remote campground. Stay and be drawn into their dreams or flee and continue his life unburdened.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
The knock on the door woke him. 4:03am displayed on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s me.&amp;rdquo; A tiny voice said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Come in and close the door.&amp;rdquo; He said, still lying under the sheet. She was inside, the door shut behind her, wide eyes now scrutinising him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Can I snuggle with you? There&amp;rsquo;s enough room for me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He nodded and she had her jeans and top off, and was pulling the sheet up before he had collected his thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Cuddle me.&amp;rdquo; She said, poking her backside into his crotch, her legs drawn up and her hair, smelling of smoke, feathered around his face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He moved his free hand over her side and brushed it over her tummy, soon followed by one of her hands over his, clasping it and trying to move it. Letting her guide, he found his hand drawn to her breast. Found it manoeuvred over her far boob and then pressed closer until his hand completely encompassed a small mound of yielding warmth under the cloth of her bra.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I like that better.&amp;rdquo; She said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He kissed the back of her head through a veil of hair, and held her breast a little tighter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I feel so safe when you hold me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you feel safe other times?&amp;rdquo; he asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Not always. When I&amp;rsquo;m frightened I remember my special dream and I let that fill my mind. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve got you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Has any of your special dream come true yet?&amp;rdquo; he asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes. Yours?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I want to tell so bad, but...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We both want dreams to come true. I won&amp;rsquo;t ask.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You are telling him today, aren&amp;rsquo;t you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes. Later today, so tonight you&amp;rsquo;ll be mine if you still want.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve packed ready.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve dreamed ready too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You wanted me without trying me.&amp;rdquo; She said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t need to try you to know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The others did, and then they didn&amp;rsquo;t want me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want them either.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Others?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;His so-called friends. He&amp;rsquo;s been trying to get rid of me to anyone he thinks might take me. They all want to try, then say my boobs are too small and they don&amp;rsquo;t want me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Did you want them to try you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No! No I never did. I hated it. He made me. &amp;lsquo;Go to your room with this man&amp;rsquo; he said. &amp;lsquo;Let him try you.&amp;rsquo; I had to do it. They were horrible. Breathing wine all over me. Hurting me. One wanted to stick it in my bum as well. I hurt him back. He didn&amp;rsquo;t like it, and neither did Greg when he found out. I&amp;rsquo;d let you though if you wanted to. I know you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt me. Mum helped clean me up when they&amp;rsquo;d done their thing. She didn&amp;rsquo;t like them like she likes you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
