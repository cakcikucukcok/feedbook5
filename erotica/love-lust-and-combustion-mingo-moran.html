  <title>Love, Lust, and Combustion - Mingo Moran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Travis Richard Davis is steel by definition. He can steel his resolve to succeed or wear it as an armor of determination. Women and life melt his heart with passion and fire it with fury, like steel turning to liquid by furnace heat before it is poured and forged into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis is a semi-professional drag racer and a hard-working master heavy equipment mechanic who also has a passion for innovation and acceleration. This guy lives, sleeps, eats, and dreams innovative ways to go faster. During his pursuit to campaign a record-holding twin turbo Drag Race Altered, he unexpectedly meets the love of his life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on real and imagined events that happened in the late 80s when turbocharging in drag racing was scoffed at, Love, Lust, and Combustion explores the turbocharged trials and tribulations of Travis Richard Davis and how a small team of motivated, smart, and hardworking individuals focused on a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;" />
