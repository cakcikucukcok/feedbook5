  <title>Extraordinary Circumstances - Alice Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=justify&gt;
Samuel Caine had the most beautiful wife in the county and two 
fine sons until his psychotic wife ran away with the yardman, a 
supporter of the KKK who had a racial vendetta against Samuel. 
KKK blackmail forced Samuel into exile and caused the 
abandonment of his son Micah. After being away for over 
twenty years searching for his son, he returns to his ancestral 
home in North Carolina to identify an ancient family ring found 
on a skeleton in a deserted gold mine. Upon Samuel&#39;s return, his 
luck worsens as a twist of fate involves him in a serious accident 
which reopens the wounds of the past. Back then, under the 
guise of the seemingly innocent antics of Samuel&#39;s young wife, 
Lucy Anne, and her fun-loving friends, &lt;i&gt;The Six Pack,&lt;/i&gt; rampant 
infidelity and bitter prejudices thrived, producing deadly 
revenges. 
&lt;p align=justify&gt;
As the old secrets unwind, two ancient rings take on 
significance, and the Caine family is thrown into one dilemma 
after another involving Lucy&#39;s psychotic escapades, Micah&#39;s 
&lt;i&gt;rebirth,&lt;/i&gt; and the chilling odysseys of the rings. It&#39;s an electrifying 
story which subtly implies genetic predisposition as it brings 
together colorful and shady characters whose greed and revenge 
escalate from infidelity to perverted sex, from blackmail to 
murder. Suspenseful and intriguing! Yet its diverse episodes and 
characters evoke more than one mood with surprising moments 
of laughter and tenderness amidst gruesome and frightening 
circumstances." />
