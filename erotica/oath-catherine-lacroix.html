      <meta name="description" content="In Lord Markov&amp;#39;s absence, Josselyn leaves the estate behind in desperation of a brighter future.

&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyprus, Isabelle and I lay across my bed side-by-side on our backs. I was positioned between them and took comfort in their warmth. I&amp;rsquo;d managed to reign in my emotions and steady my breathing. While I traced the designs of the ceiling with my eyes, a fond memory returned to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I remember&amp;hellip;one day Jeremi came home from work with six bottles of wine and a deck of playing cards. He set up a table with a huge plate of food and the drinks in this room, made sure Victoria and I were comfortable, and then ordered the servants to leave us be for the night.&amp;rdquo; I smiled, recalling how excited he&amp;rsquo;d been.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What did you do?&amp;rdquo; Isabelle asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m guessing Victoria taught him how to play Finan.&amp;rdquo; Cyprus replied.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re right, she did.&amp;rdquo; I nodded. &amp;ldquo;And Jeremi wanted to bring me in on the game--with two new rules.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How do you play normally?&amp;rdquo; Isabelle asked, toying with a loose strand of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Each card is assigned a value, and your end goal is to have the lowest score of everyone.&amp;rdquo; Cyprus summarized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Seems simple enough. What were the new rules?&amp;rdquo; She looked at me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;If you win, you drink half of your glass.&amp;rdquo; I giggled. &amp;ldquo;And if you empty your glass, you lose an article of clothing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of wine to get through,&amp;rdquo; Isabelle laughed, &amp;ldquo;and not very many pieces of clothing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And playing a game that&amp;rsquo;s extremely in Victoria&amp;rsquo;s favor.&amp;rdquo; Cyprus joined her. &amp;ldquo;We played it all the time in Lorelyn.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Learning was easy, mastering it was harder, and I&amp;rsquo;m certain they let me win more than a few times. We spent the entire night in here, laughing and draining more wine than I think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever consumed in my life.&amp;rdquo; I remembered we&amp;rsquo;d all awoken on the floor the next morning, haphazardly covered in the blankets from my bed. Not one of us remembered how we had finished the night. But&amp;hellip;that part never mattered. I just wanted to be near them always.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Josselyn, tell me,&amp;rdquo; Isabelle whispered, &amp;ldquo;what is it like&amp;hellip;to be a Ring?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Isabelle&amp;hellip;? Are you sure?&amp;rdquo; I turned toward her, only to have her lips meet mine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes. Show me,&amp;rdquo; she murmured against my mouth, &amp;ldquo;both of you.&amp;rdquo;" />
