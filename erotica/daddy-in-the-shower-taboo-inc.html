  <title>Daddy In The Shower - Taboo,  Inc.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tanya&#39;s back from college and has undertaken a new fitness regime, but when her morning jog coincides with Daddy&#39;s and there&#39;s only one shower in the house, they have to find a solution that benefits both.  What follows is a steamy no-holds-barred bout of hot, forbidden sex as he takes her hard, deep and without protection.
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
&quot;Hey you mind if I jump in the shower first?&quot; he asked, all nonchalant, and I guess you can see where this is going!
&quot;But Daddy,&quot; I said, &quot;I have breakfast with my friends in thirty minutes.&quot;
&quot;Well I have work, Tanya, and I think that&#39;s more important.&quot;
&quot;I can&#39;t be late,&quot; I pleaded.  &quot;I need to be there on time or they&#39;ll be pissed.&quot;
&quot;More pissed than my boss?&quot;
&quot;Come on, Daddy, can you just be real quick or something?&quot;
&quot;Tanya, you&#39;ve only been home a day and you&#39;re already making demands,&quot; he said, mock offended.  He often played around like that.
I giggled, unable to resist his charms.  I was like putty in his hands.
&quot;Well, how do we resolve this thing?&quot; I asked, circling a finger around the rim of my glass and looking up at him from under my brow.
I think Daddy got the message and I noticed his whole demeanor change in an instant.
&quot;Well... &quot; he began, &quot;I think I have an idea.&quot;
&quot;Oooh, Daddy, what is it.  I like ideas.&quot;
&quot;We could both hop in together?&quot;  He said the words quickly as though any further dalliance would cut through his steeled nerves.
&quot;Daddy!&quot; I gushed, pretending it was one big scandal.  &quot;What will the neighbors say?&quot;
&quot;The neighbors will never know,&quot; he said now, coming dangerously close to me." />
