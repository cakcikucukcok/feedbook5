  <title>Something Just Clicked - Adrian Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Something Just Clicked&lt;/i&gt; is the second anthology of Adrian Hunters short stories. This volume includes Hunters first bondage tale published in 1993, The Rubbermaid Chronicles, the amazing adventures of a young girl who becomes intimately acquainted with the myriad definitions of service.  It also features edgier works like Knotical, in which an unexpected telegram leads a woman on a dizzying ride from her office through the city to the local marina and far beyond.&lt;p&gt;
Every December, Hunter usually writes a new story to celebrate the Christmas season, and two of the most popular ones, Claustrophobia and Silent Knight, are included in this collection, as well as the Halloween-flavored His Favorite Holiday.&lt;p&gt;
Temporarily, and its sequel, Distemporarily, are among Hunters most enduring creations.  Documenting the travails of Samantha, an aspiring executive who is forced to submit to the machinations of her demented assistant Marla, its a rare detour for Hunter into the realm of femdom and nonconsensual proceedings.  But few readers can resist the loquacious charms of Trixie, Marlas terror of a niece best described as a cross between Anne Rice and Eloise.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Something Just Clicked&lt;/i&gt; also includes The Game, an entertaining alternative to Trivial Pursuit when spending an evening with friends, written by Chelsea Shepard, who has co-authored a full-length novel with Hunter, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.xlibris.com/bookstore/bookdisplay.asp?bookid=12495&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Once Bitten&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Finally, &lt;i&gt;Something Just Clicked&lt;/i&gt; marks the official debut of Odalisque, a novella previously available only to members of Hunters mailing list.  Set in Turkey in the late 1800s, its the story of Nairda, the aga of the janissary, who must train a kidnapped American woman to service the sultan. Unfortunately, his elite force decides to stage a coup at the same time, leaving him vulnerable to complications worthy of the gods themselves.&lt;p&gt;
