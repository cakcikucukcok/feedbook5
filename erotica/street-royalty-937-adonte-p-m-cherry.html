 This book in no way, shape, form or fashion was written to glorify a savage lifestyle. Nor to disrespect the teachings of the 5% Nation of Gods and Earth. This story is fictional and shows and proves that a person can have knowledge (know) of the lessons and be able to speak wisdom and the lessons, yet still have no understanding (true image) of the lessons. Therefore they cannot deal in equality because they are still savage in their pursuit of happiness. The 5% are righteous people who arent Pro Black nor Anti White, we are about teaching the babies. Many of us come from the street life and even after receiving the knowledge of Self still dwell in the street life out of a sense of loyalty to which we came from. If this book does anything I hope its to motivate all the true G stuck on these modern day plantations known as prisons to get knowledge of self so you can teach your seeds a much better way out. Thats the only way to slow down the prison population thats become the new Black community.
Much love and respect to those who did time and became better men. Malcolm X 7 years, Father Allah 22 months, Abu Shahid 7 plus years, Marcus Garvey 5 years, George Jackson life and even hustlers like Don King! You all changed lives and altered history in a positive way after becoming prisoners.  P.E.A.C.E" />
