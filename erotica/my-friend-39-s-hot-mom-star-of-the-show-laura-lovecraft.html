  <title>My Friend&#39;s Hot Mom: Star of the Show - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Greg loves photography and since he&#39;s gotten his new camera has been taking pictures for his friend Jack&#39;s mother, Molly to use for her calendar business. 
Little does Molly know, she&#39;s Greg&#39;s favorite subject and he has a collection of pictures of her by the pool in her sexy bikini. But she finds out when Greg mistakenly dropped off the wrong disc and Molly confronts him, showing him the pictures of her.
Embarrassed, Greg starts to apologize, but that&#39;s when things get interesting, because Molly loved the pictures so much she not only wants him to take more…this time she wants him to set his camera to record because Molly has decided she wants to make a hot movie where she&#39;s the star of the show!
