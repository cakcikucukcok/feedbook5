  <title>The Sex Board - Alexandra Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Sex Board is an entirely fictional account of the new public or should it be pubic body set up by the Irish government to provide relaxing services for all the elites in Ireland, whether they are elite people in the top ranks of the public service, top people in business and other organisations, such as charities and the Catholic church in Ireland.
With the arrival of the Sex Board, a troupe of beautiful looking young men and women, all fantastically well endowed, set out to keep all these elites happy, with unbridled scenes of sexual gratification and satisfaction. For the people they serve, no kink is too way out, no pleasure beyond bounds. For all these top elites, the arrival of the Sex Board means that they can enjoy unlimited sexual relations and pleasure. 
The book satirises each and every section of society in which these elite personnel operate. The ordinary man and woman in the street, Joe and Josephine Soap, have to pay for the heavy outgoings of the Sex Board through their punitive taxes, but since they are the little people, they are not allowed to take part in any of these romps behind closed doors. Soon, the Sex Board is working like a piston under full pressure and such is the wide scale of copulation and sexual frolics, little or no work gets done. 
Yet as this satire explains, Ireland still continues to function perfectly well, without any hindrance to services provided by the public and private sectors. Private parts are always to the fore, yet in this satire, the newly found obsession with sex at the top levels of Irish society means that everything continues, business as usual and all the really serious problems in Irish society are ignored. Perhaps there s a moral tucked away in that unprecedented devotion to amorality." />
