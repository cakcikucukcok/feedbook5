  <title>The Prison Deal (Husband Emasculation/Interracial Erotica) - Trevon Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="George is the warden of a struggling prison. He needs more funding, not just for himself but for the prison to function the way he wants it. Luck comes his way as a high profile white collar criminal heads towards his particular prison, and the mayor gives George a deal. If he can keep the newcomer safe and sound, the prison will easily be able to get all the funding it needs, and he gets the raise he&#39;s been asking for. When his wife comes to visit, George let&#39;s her know and unfortunately, it&#39;s overheard by a disgruntled prison guard.
As he&#39;s meeting with a prisoner, the disgruntled guard angrily let&#39;s the warden know of what he overheard and leaves in a huff. The prisoner, Daryl, uses this as leverage. He offers the warden a deal; he and his crew will protect the white collar criminal in exchange for a favorable parole hearing and... a conjugal visit. But it&#39;s not just anyone, he wants a visit from George&#39;s Christian, conservative wife. With his back against the wall, and after speaking with his wife, he takes Daryl&#39;s deal. As Daryl meets with George&#39;s wife, he takes her on quite the journey in George&#39;s own office. Does George end up regretting his decision to take on this Prison Deal?" />
