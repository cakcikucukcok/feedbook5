  <title>Hide and Seek - Katya Nikolaev</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Damian gazed into her face and bent to kiss her gently on the mouth. &amp;quot;No you will not, will you Elaina? In a few weeks...your going to be mine...and I am going to make everyday your breath terrifying and painful for you...Do you know why that is, little one?&amp;quot; He moved his face to kiss her ear softly. &amp;quot;B... because you can...Master.&amp;quot; Running. It&amp;#39;s what Elaina has spent the last year of her life doing...in Vain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Elaina felt him behind her as she slowly set down the logs for the kitchen fire on the barn floor. She turned slowly to face him and dropped to her knees. He stood against the frame of the barn door, and with a face holding no emotion except an angry sort of sternness, he moved into the barn and slammed closed both of the large doors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She didn&amp;#39;t dare look up as his footsteps began to make their way around her. &amp;quot;Please...Master Damian...I&amp;#39;ve done nothing wrong...&amp;quot; Elaina begged, nearly sobbing when his steel toe boots came into focus in front of her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Elaina, do not begin this punishment with lying to me.&amp;quot; He said in a soft, almost caring tone as he began to move around her again. But it was not a caring tone, not by a long shot. &amp;quot;What were you supposed to do this morning, Elaina?&amp;quot; Damian asked, and Elaina felt herself grow cold when she felt him undoing the back of her dress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She racked her brain for what could have possibly upset him, and she could not think of anything until... &amp;quot;The wood for your fire...&amp;quot; She choked after a moment. She could not hold back the sobs anymore when his fingers grazed across the pale, creamy, untouched flesh of her back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ah yes, the wood for my fire...it was not there this morning Elaina, so guess who had to go and get it?&amp;quot; He asked, kneeling down and stroking a hand through her hair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Y... you did...Master Damian...&amp;quot; She whimpered, yelping when his strong hand grabbed her jaw and jerked her face to look up into his angry, merciless eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Very good Elaina...I did...so here is what is going to happen. I am going to punish you rather severely now...and possibly a bit unfairly. What are you going to do, Elaina?&amp;quot; His fingers dug painfully into her jaw while he spoke, and at the feeling of a belt she hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed trailing down her spine, she burst into tears.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I will stay quiet Master...and when you are done beating me, I will kiss your boots and thank you. I will not tell anyone.&amp;quot; She recited for what must have been the hundredth time that week.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Damian gazed into her face and bent to kiss her gently on the mouth. &amp;quot;No you will not, will you Elaina? In a few weeks...your going to be mine...and I am going to make everyday your breath terrifying and painful for you...Do you know why that is, little one?&amp;quot; He moved his face to kiss her ear softly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;B... because you can...Master.&amp;quot; She whimpered, making a small attempt to pull away from him. It did not go unnoticed. The gentleness of the moment before passed quickly as the back of his hand flew through the air and struck her hard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She tasted blood instantly and her jaw was back in his grip. &amp;quot;Oh, poor little slave, you must have fallen and cut your lip well you were working.&amp;quot; He cooed, stroking her back with his belt again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes...Yes Master...&amp;quot; Her whole body shook violently while he straightened, wrapping the end of the belt around his fist. &amp;quot;Remember. Not a sound.&amp;quot; He growled, and lifted his arm.&lt;br /&gt;
