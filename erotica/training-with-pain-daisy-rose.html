  <title>Training With Pain - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Stephanie gets trapped in a broken elevator with a sexy, dominating alpha male who also happens to be her boss, she panics. And she should be, because he is capable of breaching her every defense and taking her with the brutal strength of his passion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her life is turned upside down when she falls into a world of domination and submission with more men than she can handle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He inhaled again, greedily, as if taking in my scent. Frozen by his actions, I waited for his next words without breathing. &amp;quot;Perhaps I would have a taste of you here first.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then his mouth was on mine. He pressed me against the far wall of the elevator and I could feel his hot, hard body against mine, his warm hands on the small of my back, pressing hard to push me to him. I came absurdly close to relaxing in his embrace, to kissing him back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Instead, I got a hold of my brain and my hands struggled up to press him away. His chest was hard. It was like trying to move a tree. Whimpers escaped my lips, but I realized they sounded more like moans than protests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My teeth were clenched tightly together, stopping his tongue from entering my mouth, but he ran his tongue over my teeth and tasted me nevertheless. His fingers on my body tightened, leaving fingerprints on my skin. My body was betraying me, loving the rough way he handled me. It was easy to surrender when he gave me no other choice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t help but notice you aren&amp;#39;t telling me to let go,&amp;quot; he groaned. I felt something hard press against my thigh and gulped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not,&amp;quot; I whispered harshly. I knew I should. There were a million and one things I should be doing. Most of all, I should be fighting back and screaming rape, but the truth was, I didn&amp;#39;t want him to stop. It was insane. Everything about this was insane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Victor was right about you being a natural submissive,&amp;quot; he growled. I felt his hands on my arms, gently pulling me forward. &amp;quot;But it is hard for you to just surrender, isn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My breaths were coming out in ragged heaves, lifting and lowering my chest with effort. I kept still as his hands roamed over my body, coming so close to touching bare skin as he moved down my waist. He cupped my buttocks and I let out a short hiss. It felt good to be touched again, to be wanted. And this man wanted me with a desperate groan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Surrendering goes against everything you&amp;#39;d been taught. You want it to be earned. You want me to be rough,&amp;quot;" />
