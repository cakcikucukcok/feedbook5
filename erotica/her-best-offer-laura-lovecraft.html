  <title>Her Best Offer - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“Hmmm, there are some nicks here.” She rubbed her finger along the edge.
“Really?” Pretending to be surprised, I walked over and bending over stared at where her finger was.
“Yup, here and here.” She moved her finger a few inches to the left.
“Huh.” I grunted, and then lifted my eyes to stare down her shirt.
This close I could see more of the black lace cup of her bra and could just make out a little of the pink flesh around her nipple peeking out.
“Well it is used.” I shrugged, as I straightened up.
“True, but the ad said perfect condition.”
She came around to my side and looked at one of the chairs. She squatted down to tug on the rungs and the move caused her dress to ride up and flash me the bottoms of her well rounded ass cheeks.
“This one’s loose.” She wiggled it and acting like I cared enough to look at it, I came around the other side of the chair, giving up my view of her ass cheeks to get another good look down her dress. “And there are a few nicks on the top of it too.”
“Well you can just take a wood filler stick to them and sand it a bit.” I told her, “It’s not a lot of work.”
“I guess not.” She stood up and shrugged, making her tits jiggle. “So, how much?”
“It’s right in the ad, four fifty.” I forced my gaze up to her face now that she was paying attention.
“But it has all those nicks.” She pointed out, “Can you do a little better for me?”
“Well,” I stroked my chin, pretending to mull it over. “You did come all the way over here and I can tell you really like it….how about four hundred?” I winked, “Just for you.”
“You mean the price you really wanted.” She returned the wink, “Come on, Kenny give me a real deal.”
“That’s the best I can do.” I told her.
“Aw, but honey.” She pushed her lips into a pout, “I really want this table!” She lowered her head and with her blue eyes peering out from beneath her long lashes added, “Please? Please give me a better deal?”
“I…well…”
She gave me a big smile as I stammered and I thought this so wasn’t fair. “Tell you what; I’ll give you two fifty.”
“Two fifty? That’s not even close.”
“But it’s all I have.” She pouted again, “And it would look so good in my house.” She sighed, “It would make me really happy.”
“I can’t.”
“Sure you can.” She said, “Come on, Kenny, do a girl a favor.” She moved closer to me and was now so close her breasts were almost touching my chest. “Pretty please?”
“Sorry, but my dad said not to take less than four hundred.” Soon as I spoke I wanted to slap myself in the head, God, I’d just made myself sound pathetic.
She turned away from me and walked up to the table, “Honey, we have to work something out because I so want this!”
“Jasmine I can’t go…”
My words faded away when she bent all the way over the table to run her hands over the opposite end. Her dress rose all the way up, showing off her well rounded ass that was bare except for the thin black string of her thong, between her smooth, white ass cheeks.
“God I want this.” She said in a soft, sexy purr, “Haven’t you ever wanted anything so bad you could taste it, Kenny?”
“I do know that feeling.” I said in a barely audible whisper.
“Hmm, I’m sure you do.” She continued running her hand across the table, her ass swaying back and forth as she did.
“Your deal was two fifty.” I reminded her, “I can’t do that.”
“Two fifty in cash.” She gave me a sly smile, “Who says that’s all I have to offer?”
“What do you…?”
“Tell you what, baby,” she put her hands on my arms, “How about this. How about I give you two fifty and the best blow job you’ve ever had?”" />
