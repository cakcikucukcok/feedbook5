  <title>The Spanish Billionaire&#39;s Hired Bride - Rachel Lyndhurst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The last thing billionaire Ricardo Almanza wants is to be married. Unfortunately, the notorious playboy needs wife before he&#39;s thirty, and time is running out, His stepmother&#39;s sexy, debt-ridden personal assistant seems like the perfect solution, so he makes her a business deal she can&#39;t refuse--one million euros for three months as his wife. He might even enjoy being married to Helen...providing he can convince her not to kick him somewhere painful again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helen Marshall can&#39;t believe Ricardo&#39;s outrageous proposal, or that she&#39;s considering it, but she must help clear her parents&#39; debts or her family faces financial ruin. The small print on the marriage contract states they&#39;ll be husband and wife for three months in every way--including in the bedroom. But there&#39;s nothing in the contract about falling in love, or what they do when the three months is up and they want to negotiate a clause binding them forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
