  <title>The Contract - JG Leathers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Illustrations ONLY available in Paperback version. To live the full experience, please purchase the paperback. The Contract, by JG-Leathers was previously published as two separate books by Gord Books. The author has not only combined these powerful stories into one stunning novel, but added 40,000 words and ten of his own sketches. The complete complement of all the original illustrations by Simon Benson are also included, made available with the gracious permission of Gord.&quot;&quot; Susan Henderson is a bored young woman looking for some spice in her life. Upon reading an advertisement in an up-scale womens magazine that stated excellent pay was being offered for a five year, foreign service position, provided the applicant passed rigorous intelligence, appearance, and aptitude tests. She is soon enticed into a world of ever-increasing, inescapable bondage, then soon held deep in the fastness of a Middle Eastern Palace. Here she learns her true place in life, discovering a world within her own mind that also cannot be escaped or evaded. Susan Henderson&#39;s voyage continues when she is inducted into different deviant training programs. Much to her distress, she soon discovers what it is like to be a domestic animal and spends a substantial length of time in this role. She is eventually freed to be taken on a shopping expedition in the real world, controlled thoroughly at all times. Soon after, she becomes a human equine, undergoing intense training as a Horse Woman, then as a four legged, ridden Pony Girl, and finally, as one of the Sheik&#39;s famous Lipizzaner Mares. JG Leathers proves he is the professor of prose with his finely tuned descriptions. &quot;" />
