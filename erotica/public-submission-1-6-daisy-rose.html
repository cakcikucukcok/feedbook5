~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
Excerpt from Public Submission 6: Lawyer
It took but a moment before he spoke again, but it felt like an age had past. &quot;Take off your panties, little angel,&quot; he said. &quot;Or I&#39;ll stop the car right now.&quot;
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t!&quot; I gasped, still fighting for air.
Secretly, I was turned on by the suggestion. He knew about my exhibitionist and voyeuristic tendencies, but had never made me do it before. &quot;It&#39;s too risky!&quot; I argued. &quot;What if we get caught?&quot;
I was going around in circles and he knew it. He did not appreciate it. He glared at me and I felt the car slow down as he turned to me.
The cars behind us honked and swore at us colorfully as they drove past.
&quot;What&#39;re you doing? Rex! Please!&quot; I begged. There was a familiar stir of primal desire coiled in my belly and a tightening between my legs that said, &#39;why not? Why not just do what my new husband wants? It&#39;s certainly easier and more fun.&#39;
&quot;Take off your panties,&quot; he repeated, taking the car to an almost snail-like pace. He was slowly moving to the side of the road and I knew he wasn&#39;t bluffing.
I reached down my dress and shimmied out of my panties before he could stop the car completely.
&quot;There,&quot; I said triumphantly and he grinned.
&quot;Very good, pet,&quot; he said, using my pet name on me.
I knew it was going to get worse if he started using my pet name. He only ever called me that when he wanted a session with me. There&#39;s no way he wanted a session right now? In the middle of a highway?
The light shined brightly at us.
&quot;Now, take off your dress.&quot;" />
