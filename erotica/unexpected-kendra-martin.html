  <title>Unexpected - Kendra Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Felicia Benson has finally begun to recover from her heartbreaking divorce from her unfaithful husband. She has remarried and is now pregnant with twins. Although she and Harold receive a devastating note on their honeymoon that sends them into a tailspin, they both discover that theyve kept secrets from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the birth of her twins, Felicia finds herself in an unexpected situation. It was so unexpected, that her marital struggles cause her moral compass to blur and eventually disappear. She tries to escape it, but the irresistible nature of the culprit pulls Felicia into another web of deception. Even a trip to Jamaica with her girlfriends doesnt pull her back from the brink; in fact, the extracurricular activities of her friends help to validate her decisions. In response to Harolds controlling nature, Felicia becomes more vocal about her dissatisfaction with her husband, which gives her yet more justification for her choices. But what will she do when she learns that the man of her dreams loves her far more than she couldve imagined?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in Rochester, NY, Unexpected is the engaging and erotic sequel to Exes and Excess in which Felicias continued missteps and unbridled passion once again cause betrayal and infidelity to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;" />
