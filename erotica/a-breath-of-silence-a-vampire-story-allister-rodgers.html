  <title>A Breath of Silence, a Vampire Story - Allister Rodgers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I took a wicked breath of a storms raging darkness to survive my people hiding just underneath the cloak. As you read through these dark leafs of a strange existence gathering just underneath the witching hour of darkness you will find, in this passage, there is a dark frightening savoring taste of insatiable erotic pleasures starting to infest restless desires inside you. 
You, the inquiring reader, the innocent courageous seeker, will find as well, an undeniable high measure of fresh sensual seductive sins overflowing with private sensational waves of sizzling virgins. I watched my girls dress and became a seeker as I saw the overwhelming urges boiled nightly inside their lonely dark rooms. I watched them lying innocent and naked fighting the season of the fires and the sinister will of imagining a slave mongers touch roaming the kept forbidden zones while mentally tugging the soft pulp of fine oiled black brilliance of long coiling stalks over laying a fresh nest of newly found silken growth on their smooth flesh 
Read, as the seductive under-cooked sensational lures capture your attention and rattle your imagination with haunting sounds of their inner erotic chains. As you read, you too will find, you will also be unleashing, unto your soft deep throbbing tissue a devouring ancient madness, searching out insatiable pleasures found in a sensuous darkness that roam in the rich curious minds of innocent virgins. Very soon, you will become aware of the true close knitting presence and the soft caressing spirits whispering selfishly around you, cursing the gathering winds. As you sleep and toil, be aware of the sounds in the wailing storms that will howl and enter your bedrooms rushing hunger, brushing sensitive hairs and steal your most private hidden desires. 
Relax, and abandon your fears and carefully read as, a deformed beautiful presence starts to materialized in the wild bush, secretly watching you, stimulating your comfort zone and making you restless. The presence touches you even in the privacy of your bedroom invading your dreams even in the shower! In your very next raging storm 
Believe as I did and Fear the Innocent Brush of the Caressing Wind" />
