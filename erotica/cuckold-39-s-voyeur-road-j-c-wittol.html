  <title>Cuckold&#39;s Voyeur Road - J.C. Wittol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nick and Nicole are the quintessential suburban couple: great jobs, two fantastic kids, and successful careers. In an effort to spice up their marriage, they embark on a new and exciting relationship with Collin, a wealthy, gorgeous executive. Nicole’s passion for her new black lover is unbridled, and Nick discovers that he loves his new role as a Cuckold Husband.
Collin and Nicole descend even further into a sex-laden affair. Their lust and passion for each other seems limitless. Now addicted to watching the sexy couple, Nick purchases a chastity device, a new toy designed to increase his frustration and pleasure as he sinks further into the role of Cuckold Husband. He continues to struggle with his own desires, which the chastity belt seems to make even stronger.
Collin and Nicole start openly dating, and Collin introduces his beautiful Latin lover to a world of professional athletes, movie stars and super-wealthy individuals. Nicole is soon surrounded by wealthy black men, and finds Collin’s world too seductive to resist.
Nick witnesses how money, power, and her gorgeous black lover capture his wife completely. He struggles to hold onto his wife, maintain his career, and protect his daughters.
Cuckold’s Voyeur Road is the continuing story of Nick and Nicole, and their journey down the path less traveled.
~~~~~  Excerpt  ~~~~~
Beautiful people.
All of them were standing, talking, and laughing together. The in-crowd. I watched them for a while and when some bodies shifted, I finally saw my wife. She stood next to Collin, her arm inside his, laughing with another man who was talking with them both. He looked like the same guy she’d let fondle her and then kissed.
I tore my eyes away from the party and scanned the crowd. I didn’t want to get caught staring. A smorgasbord of beautiful women filled the club. Flesh glistened under the club lights, scantily clad women competed for attention, and men stared hungrily. When I looked back at the party, Nicole was talking with a woman, smiling and whispering like old friends. They put down their drinks and left the VIP area together. Arm in arm, they strode towards the bathroom; and throughout the club heads swiveled in their direction.
The urge to follow them was overpowering. I set my drink down at the bar, and indicated to the bartender that I would be right back. The crowd was thick. I made my way through the throng of bodies towards the restroom. There was no way I was going to follow the girls into their restroom, but I wanted to be a little closer to Nicole. I wanted to see her up close and maybe eavesdrop on her conversation.
I leaned up against the wall and waited. A steady crowd of people flowed to and from the restroom and I started to think that there was no way I’d see her. I stood even less of a chance of overhearing her, as well.
Fortunately, I was wrong.
A loud shriek of laughter echoed in the hallway, and I glanced around the corner. Nicole and the other woman were holding on to each other and laughing hysterically. I pulled back and listened.
“He’s big?”
I didn’t recognize the voice.
“Huge and he knows how to use it.” I recognized Nicole’s voice and her giggle. “His body is amazing, like black granite. I’m getting wet just thinking about him.”
“Wow,” she said past a giggle. “You’re lucky. He is gorgeous. Hey, what’s going on with his attorney? Am I crazy or did I see sparks flying between you two?”
“You’re not crazy. I think his attorney is hot,” Nicole’s voice replied. “We kissed the other night.”
“Wow. You are so bad! Maybe you could have both of them.” She giggled. “Does Collin share?”
“What?” Nicole&#39;s voice was shocked, but intrigued. “No, well, I don’t know. We’ve never talked about it.” Silence echoed in the hallway before her voice shattered it. “Do you think he would?”
“I don’t know, but some guys like that sort of thing. You should talk with him about it. Wouldn’t that be a fun night?”" />
