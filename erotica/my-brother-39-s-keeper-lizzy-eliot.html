  <title>My Brother&#39;s Keeper - Lizzy Eliot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sal, my big brother, is a smoking-hot hunk, an animal. Animals need keepers who can make sure they are kept on a short lead. And when I catch him stealing money from Mom, well, he has good reason to obey my commands. I like the power you get from having a powerful animal doing your bidding, and the fact that I&#39;ll make him screw his little sister, break that nasty taboo, is even more delicious.
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
My brother’s name is Salvador. His buddies call him Sally, but everyone else sticks with Sal. He’s older than me…I’m in my second year at the local junior college and I think he’s smoking hot. He’s an intimidating guy…around six-four and over two hundred pounds. A wrestling scholarship got him through college where he majored in fucking around. That meant that he graduated with no idea what he wanted to do, so he moved back into his room.
I didn’t mind that in the least. Having him around was always entertaining. Since I was little, whenever Sally’s had his friends come over and hang out, I’d hide a listen to them talk. He’s never figured out that I could go in the closet in my room and hear every word. Besides all the shit you’d expect them to talk about, like which ones give good head, or will take it in the ass. I’d listen to every word and look up what I didn’t understand on the internet. Ya gotta love the internet.
One phrase they used a lot caught my attention: “That one’s a keeper.”
Now I know what they meant…they’d found a hot chick who would suck cock, give them a good time and be no trouble. They wanted to keep a girl around who was submissive…all pleasure and no pain. My brain put a different spin on it. I’d listen to them, fingering myself and think about how these guys were animals, smoking hot animals, and how good they’d be if they had a keeper, like zoo animals. A keeper who could keep them on a short leash. That much masculine energy, when under the control of a girl who liked trouble was about the hottest thing in the world. I fantasized about finding a way to control these assholes…to keep them for my pleasure.
See, unlike their keepers, I like trouble. All the time Sally was off at college I was thinking. There are kept women and kept men, but often as not that refers to a financial arrangement. There are other ways to keep someone, make sure they do your bidding, and I started researching it. After all, the idea turned me on.
From the beginning, as soon as I reached puberty I dated guys that reminded me of my brother, and my father for that matter…big strong guys who are macho. They think they are in charge. They aren’t.
