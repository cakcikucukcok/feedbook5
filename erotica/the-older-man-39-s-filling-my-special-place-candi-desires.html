Is she really about to give up her first time to Oliver, an older man? And will he be okay if they do it hard and without protection?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m waiting for you!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Wow,&amp;quot; Oliver says with a smile, shaking his head. &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t believe you&amp;#39;re finally an adult now.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Karina, Oliver&amp;#39;s 18-year old friend&amp;#39;s daughter, is having her birthday today. She smiles brightly at her buddy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I know,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s hard for me to believe too.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;So Oliver,&amp;quot; Karina waggles her eyebrows at him. &amp;quot;What say you pick us up some beer and let&amp;#39;s get this party started, huh?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Oliver gapes at her, and Karina can only hold in her laughter for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Ha ha, I&amp;#39;m sorry Oliver,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;I couldn&amp;#39;t help it. I know I still can&amp;#39;t legally drink yet.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Oliver can&amp;#39;t help but chuckle at his friend&amp;#39;s daughter&amp;#39;s joke.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s okay, honey,&amp;quot; he says with a smile. &amp;quot;I knew you were messing around.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Karina is getting close to getting her period, but she&amp;#39;s not there yet. This is the time of her cycle where she&amp;#39;s the most fertile. It&amp;#39;s also the time where she feels the most turned on.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Several times a day over the past week Karina&amp;#39;s had to excuse herself to go relieve a little tension, but today she doesn&amp;#39;t think her hand is going to do it. Her brain has cottoned on. She knows that she needs something else. Her body is craving a real person. And her body is craving for her to become pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You know what, Oliver?&amp;quot; Karina says, and she steps forward, wrapping her arms around Oliver, giving him a hug.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Oliver is shocked for a moment, but then he hugs his little princess back. When they separate he says, &amp;quot;What was that for?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;For taking care of all of this,&amp;quot; Karina tells him. &amp;quot;And just for&amp;hellip;for being the best friend a girl could ask for.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;She smiles up into his eyes, and he smiles right back down at her.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You know, honey,&amp;quot; Oliver says to his friend&amp;#39;s daughter. &amp;quot;I must say, I get worried about you at your college sometimes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Oh yeah?&amp;quot; Karina asks. &amp;quot;Why do you get worried?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Because, all the guys there must be falling over themselves trying to get to you,&amp;quot; he says. Karina looks up at him as he takes in her incredible body and beautiful face with one look. &amp;quot;And I must say, if I were there, I&amp;#39;d do the exact same thing.&amp;quot;" />
