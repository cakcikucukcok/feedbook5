  <title>The Bedroom Takeover - Shannay Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DAMAGED? 
Alex Linton had a rough start in life. After witnessing the murder of her mother at the hands of the man she trusted most, she took her brother and set out to create something better for them both... Life had another path planned for her. After unexpected troubles occur, in walks Bill, her savior. He helped her overcome many obstacles during her formative years and she ended up doing well. She became the owner of a multinational cooperation Reuben Inc. She trusted only a few and because of this she kept her private life...well, private-- in hopes that her past never reared its ugly head. 
BROKEN! 
Dane Cunningham was raised to be a businessman. After graduating top of his class, he was expected to take over his family&#39;s business. When his mother died, he found out that the &quot;family&quot; business wasn&#39;t his to take. Raised by a ruthless man who made it clear that he would not be part of the company any longer, he sets out to take over another company but his cowardly opponent Alex stands in his way. 
LUST, LIES &amp; DRAMA 
At a charity event hosted by Rueben Inc, Dane decides to capitalize on his competitors usual absence but gets distracted when he learns that his rival&#39;s sister was present. At the mere sight of her, he decided she was how he could get what he wanted. Soon, sparks fly and now Dane has to deal with his feelings for her. Alex&#39;s past catches up on her and she finds out that her most trusted friend had been lying to her for years. She has to deal with feelings for her arrogant rival, her past and betrayal...no wonder she cant trust anyone. Did he stage a bedroom takeover in order to land the company she was about to claim?
