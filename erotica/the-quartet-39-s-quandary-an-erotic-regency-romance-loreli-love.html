  <title>The Quartet&#39;s Quandary: An Erotic Regency Romance - Loreli Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="~~~This is a 50,000 word erotic regency romance.~~~
Miss Abigail Buxton is second daughter of recently deceased Marquis of Comerford and has spent her life in the shadow of her older sister Margaret.
Sir John Kingman has recently assumed the title of the Viscount of Worthington, with all its responsibilities including the need to procure a wife and heir. When he meets Lady Margaret Buxton, she appears to be the perfect woman for him, except that she is too forward with his younger brother Charles.
As dutiful second son, Colonel Charles Kingman joined the military ten years ago, but all the pain and death has jaded him and he wants to retire from service and settle down, despite the consequent reduction in his pension. While visiting his brother in Cornwall, he encounters the lovely and tempting Buxton sisters and decides to offer his hand to Abigail.
The quandary that ensues arises from the complications that arise when the ways of the heart do not always coincide with the ways of the head" />
