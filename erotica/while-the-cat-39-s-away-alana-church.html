  <title>While The Cat&#39;s Away - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Cat:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After catching her teenage daughter drinking, Katherine Swenson decided that her children could not be trusted to be home alone while she was at a church conference. Desperate for assistance, she turned to her niece, Cindy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Cousin:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Forced to help her aunt by her parents, who wanted some private time alone, Cindy had barely resigned herself to a week on the farm when her eye was caught by her delectable young cousins. Would she be able to contain her hunger? Or would the tides of passion prove to be too much to resist?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Mice:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dawn and Donny expected nothing but boredom while their cousin, a bible-thumping bore who was even more conservative than their mother, was in charge. Imagine their surprise when sweet cousin Cindy turns out to be a sexually open young woman with an unquenchable lust for life!&lt;br /&gt;
