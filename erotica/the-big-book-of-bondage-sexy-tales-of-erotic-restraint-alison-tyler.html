  <title>The Big Book of Bondage: Sexy Tales of Erotic Restraint - Alison Tyler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Surrender to your fantasies. Every submissive willingly does: bound and helpless, expecting the ecstasy of her master&#39;s lash. Never mind the leather&amp;#8212;clothed or naked, she is stripped down to only the most basic physical and emotional need, completely exposed. But it&amp;#8217;s this swirl of sensations and feelings that combine in a perfect storm of kink and makes the seemingly impossible not only occur, but happen in a way that creates a sexy good time for everyone involved. The sensual stories that Alison Tyler has assembled in this collection delve into the dynamics of relationships filled with such unrestrained passion, revealing a world of beautiful contradictions that will thrill and inspire you. Some of these tales show how the everyday can be instantly transformed into pulse-quickening moments laced with eroticism. Nobody likes bondage more than Alison Tyler who is endlessly fascinated with the sensation of giving up, giving in, of putting one&amp;#8217;s pleasure (and pain) into the hands of another. To her, bondage means &amp;#8220;I trust you to keep me safe,&amp;#8221; and yet BDSM can also mean, &amp;#8220;I trust you to hurt me.&amp;#8221; Because the most important part of bondage, of dominance, of all the slippery ways one can play with those concepts is trust.In the BDSM realm, trust involves crops, whips, blindfolds, handcuffs, paddles, belts, gags, and toys. How deliciously, devilishly twisted is that?" />
