  <title>A Pleasant Mistake - Allison Heather</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
Caroline is an intern in her family owned multi-billion industry. Unlike the stick and bones females of present time, she is a full bodied curvy woman, but still unattached. Her mother decides she needs help with her self confidence. Caroline is also recruited to help with her mother&#39;s perceived problem with her husband. Father and daughter are sent to a vacation away from the stress of the work to Maldives. Caroline and her father make most of a genuine misunderstanding.
EXCERPT
I came to gasping and found myself buried under the warm safe crushing weight of my father. I felt his mouth kissing me all over my face. Daddy&#39;s cock was still embedded in my pussy. I was not surprised to find it rock hard and throbbing.
“Thanks dad,” I whispered in shy manner, given the circumstances, “by the feel of a hard monster throbbing inside my pussy, it seems my dad is going to love me more.”
Daddy kissed the tip of my nose (Dad says my beautiful nose smiles as I do, I have no idea how that would be apparent, but I believe him. I do know my father is fascinated with my nose along with other things.), “Caro, this is just a start. I want to love you all night. I hope I did not disappoint you.”
“NO!” I screamed and then blushed ay my brazenness, “Dad, it was unbelievable. I want to do it again and again. I want you to show me everything you do with mom. Would you please?” I widened my eyes as I do when I plead with my dad, knowing fully well he will not refuse.
Daddy kissed my nose and said in his heavy low voice with a slight edge, “Everything, Caro?’
If there was some a subtle warning, I missed it and said, with a beaming, smile, “Everything Daddy, everything.”" />
