  <title>Made To Pleasure Them - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rose is an innocent, a young house-maid in the service of a powerful Lord. And she has no idea of the depravity he has in store for her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His friends are coming to visit. Young noblemen with a taste for fresh meat. And Rose is to be the main course...&lt;br /&gt;

~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The doorknob was turning, and so I straightened my back, forcing a smile as I awaited the arrival of the guests. Lord Evans was first to enter, holding the door open for four other men, all of whom filtered into the room with odd grins plastered on their faces. I observed them with a keen eye, trying my best to seem polite and demure in front of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lord Evans shut the door behind himself, turning to me and staring down at me. The sudden attention was a little concerning - I didn&amp;#39;t know how to act under such a sharp gaze. I shifted awkwardly, folding my arms over my chest and averting my gaze. This earned a chuckle form one of the men, and I swore I could feel the blood rushing up to my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Rose.&amp;quot; Lord Evans spoke, voice loud and in stark contrast with the silence of the room. I promptly sprung to attention, spine straight and eyes glued to his own. He grinned, taking a step back and looking towards his guests. &amp;quot;These are my guests.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t know how to respond to Lord Evans stating the obvious. I nodded, unsure of what else I was supposed to do - although in that moment it suddenly became clear that Lord Evans meant to introduce these men to me. I knew not why, seeing as women of my social standing weren&amp;#39;t necessarily meant to engage in small talk with male aristocrats - but I went with it, knowing that Lord Evans had a plan." />
