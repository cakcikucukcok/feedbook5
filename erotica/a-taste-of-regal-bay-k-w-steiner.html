  <title>A Taste of Regal Bay - K.W. Steiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A brief glimpse into life in Regal Bay, with the writer of the column &amp;quot;A Taste if Regal Bay&amp;quot; Sharon Decker enjoying a day under the sun on Hayes Beach, where she gets a taste of two men, one much younger and the other much older.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t usual for people to have public sex on Hayes Beach. However, Sharon had only participated a handful of times over the years, and even then, it had been at night. It was even rarer for a couple to engage during the morning hours. This would be one of those rare days, Sharon realized as neither of them seemed to have much to say. She brought her eyes up to meet his, and after a moment to take in his deep brown eyes and sly grin on his lips, Sharon stepped close and he pulled her mouth to his.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Miguel&amp;rsquo;s arms went around her shoulders, Sharon felt the point of his cock press into her belly, just above her pubic mound. Their tongues engaged as his hands ran down her sides. Their bodies drew tighter together as his arms wrapped around her waist, and her breasts smashed against his hairy chest. Her nipples hardened against his flesh. He rolled his hips and his cock slipped downward. She parted her thighs and it stroked across her slot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hhhmmmm,&amp;rdquo; she sighed into Miguel&amp;rsquo;s mouth. She stroked his thick head of dark hair. He grabbed hold of her ass and pulled her tighter to him. When she pulled her mouth from his to catch her breath, Miguel dropped to his knees before her, and then lower still. He pulled her to him and began to kiss the tops of her thighs, and then across the mound of her pubic bone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oooohhh, Miguel!&amp;rdquo; Sharon cried as his tongue flicked out and began to attack her clit." />
