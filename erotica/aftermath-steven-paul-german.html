  <title>Aftermath - Steven Paul-Germané</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mom is missing, Dad is literally losing it the longer the two of them are apart, and my brothers arent my brothersor so it seems. Patrick is doing things that remind me of Phil and me. He is just a lost cause because of his luck with women. And me . . .
I am torn between two brothers and dont want to choose between the two of them. They both give me something different, and they both love me. I love them too but differently as well. I know it is wrong, but I cant help myself. The passion the three of us generate together is unstoppable, and they know it as well as I do. I am so fucked up and feel that the world wont understand.
Nothing is as it seems. I keep remembering. I have been put through hell. It is all because of one manor so I assumeand that is Victor Grant. Even he isnt as he seems. He isnt who he claims to be either. Everything is one big mess. I try to stay one foot ahead of him, but he is always a mile ahead of me. He causes me to break every rule I have in place for myself to keep me grounded when it comes to love, sex, money, life, or whatever, and now the only rules I am playing by is his, not mine.
I have to do things that I am not proud of, and I have to make sacrifices that no one my age should have to make. I have to do things that I dont want to, but I am slowly becoming accustomed too and, honestly, enjoying the more I did it. 
This cat-and-mouse game with Mr. Grant is taking another turn, and I will not stop until I have made sure that my family is back together again. I have to do it for my dad this time, and regardless of what I am up against, I will succeed because I wont stop until he has Mother back in his arms. Failure is not an option. I have gotten Antonio and Dad back home, and now Ill do the same and get Mother backno matter what.
I am determined. After all, my name is Philip Eugene Stevens, Storm. And I always get what I want and eventually on my terms." />
