  <title>Martin&#39;s Mom - James Hawthorn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Matt is found out by Charlotte, but blackmail is not on her mind, the lack of sexual attention from her husband has turned her attention to her son and she needs Matt&amp;#39;s help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jacqui was in the kitchen, on her knees, with her husbands cock in her mouth. Derek has thoroughly enjoyed his wife&amp;#39;s rediscovered sex drive and was taking every opportunity to cum in her mouth as she allowed, holding her head with both hands as he was getting ready to cum, the front door closed loudly and he looked over his shoulder to see his other daughter, Karen, walk into the kitchen &amp;quot;Dad!?! What are you . . ?&amp;quot; Wide eyed and cumming in his wife&amp;#39;s mouth, all he could say was &amp;quot;Oh God Yes!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh for goodness sake, can&amp;#39;t you do that in your bedroom, jeezus, c&amp;#39;mon&amp;quot; Karen turned and walked out to the lounge. Jacqui smiled up at her husband as licked the cum off her fingers. &amp;quot;Love You.&amp;quot; Derek smiled awkwardly. Karen hadn&amp;#39;t been home in years, her parents were wondering what the issues were.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jacqui readjusted herself and headed into the lounge. &amp;quot;Hi darling, how are you?&amp;quot; She leant in to embrace her, but Karen took a step back. &amp;quot;Dad just came in your mouth mom, don&amp;#39;t you want to go freshen up or something?&amp;quot; Jacqui laughed and kissed her daughters cheek. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not like I smeared it all over my face. It&amp;#39;s lovely to see you, what&amp;#39;s up?&amp;quot; Karen sat on the sofa, heavily, sighed the end of world&amp;#39;s sigh. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m moving home. Tom&amp;#39;s kicked me out.&amp;quot; Jacqui sat down and put her arm over her daughters shoulder. &amp;quot;Oh no, what happened?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tears welled up in Karen eyes and she burst out crying &amp;quot;HE&amp;#39;S FUCKING SOMEONE ELSE!!!!!&amp;quot; Jacqui rocked her daughter back and forth as she recounted the arguments she and her boyfriend had been having and culminating in the break down of the relationship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Derek was waiting in the hallway, unsure of what to do or say, as Beth walked in. &amp;quot;Hi Dad, you okay?&amp;quot; Derek hugged his daughter, &amp;quot;Karen home. She&amp;#39;s crying. I came in your moms mouth&amp;quot; a look of uncertainty passed over Beth, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure that wasn&amp;#39;t the reason she started crying?&amp;quot; Derek smiled &amp;quot;no, Tom broke up with her, it was just bad timing. And we were in the kitchen when she caught us&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Ah okay, that makes a bit more sense. Okay, I&amp;#39;ll go in and see her.&amp;quot; She kissed her father and went into the lounge to comfort her sister, with her mother.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Matt was upstairs in his room, reviewing the footage from the cameras. Mrs Beckford looked even better on film than he remembered. She was very eager and complimentary, but the cameras really picked up her passion. Matt was expecting great results when she and Martin got together. He cut and edited the whole thing from arrival to end and mixed in some good zooms and messaged Mrs Beckford over &amp;#39;mother less&amp;#39; with her personal link. This one wouldn&amp;#39;t get uploaded to &amp;#39;clips 4 sale&amp;#39;, at least, not by him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dave and Alice were out shopping and dining and enjoying the life of a couple in love, as far as anyone else should care. Linked arm in arm, they happily strolled from one shop to the next." />
