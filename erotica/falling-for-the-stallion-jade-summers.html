  <title>Falling for the Stallion - Jade Summers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I&amp;#39;ve loved horses for as long as I can remember. Other girls think about princes or knights carrying them off into the sunset, but I always pictured myself with the horse. Now that I finally have my own horse, Lancelot, I&amp;#39;m with him every day. It was only natural that things started to develop between us. And not just love and affection, but animal things like mating. It was a dream for a long time, but now I will finally get to feel Lance&amp;#39;s massive member inside me. It&amp;#39;s so enormous, though. I only hope it will fit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I graduated from high school, my uncle let me work on his farm so I moved up there and was around Lance every day and night. It was magical, but there was a part of me that always felt that something was missing. I never told anyone about my fantasies &amp;hellip; any human, that is. In the evenings I would stand next to Lance and whisper my fantasies into his ear and would rest my head on his until I would practically fall asleep standing up. I know it&amp;rsquo;s crazy, but I really felt like he understood what I was telling him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
One night when I was brushing his mane, Lance started stomping and acting nervous. I kept talking to him in a soothing voice, but everything I did seemed to make him more agitated. Finally, I looked down and saw what the problem was. Lance was in heat and his two foot long cock was unsheathed and was sticking out underneath him. I was in shock. I&amp;rsquo;d dreamt of this moment my whole life, and now that I was in the presence of a massive horse cock, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
I decided to use this opportunity to explore, so I got down on my knees and touched the tip of his cock with my fingers. A deep sound came from Lance and his agitation stopped, so I was sure this was what he was trying to communicate. He just had no way of telling me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
I wrapped my hands around the enormous head, then moved them down the shaft and felt Lance thrusting into me gently. When both of my hands were moving slowly up and down the shaft, I touched my tongue to the head of his cock. It was soft and salty and I loved it. It was way too big for me to put my mouth around, so I ran my lips and tongue around the head while I continued to move my hands up and down the shaft. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long at all before Lance&amp;rsquo;s cock grew even larger and more rigid.&amp;nbsp;" />
