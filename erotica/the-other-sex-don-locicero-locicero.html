  <title>The Other Sex - Don LoCicero LoCicero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Helen and Harold awake one morning transfigured into each other, their world is thrown into chaos. Will the hostile mother-in-law who refuses to believe that the pregnant woman is not her daughter, but her daughter&#39;s husband, help solve their dilemma? Will their burned out pastor offer them spiritual comfort? Can the idealistic social worker who is also a fierce karate expert be a source of pragmatic advice? Is a famous transvestite lawyer able to provide them with legal aid? Will Harold opt for an abortion to avoid subjecting his offspring to the stigma of having a mother who is really its father? The reader will alternately roar with laughter and shake her/his head in disbelief as one bizarre episode follows another, blurring the lines between the sexes, as well as those between reality and appearance. With &lt;I&gt;THE CONCRETE LIONS&lt;/I&gt;, Don LoCicero joins the exalted literary ranks of Franz Kafka, Nikolai Gogol, Joseph Heller and Woody Allen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
