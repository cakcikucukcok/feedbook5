&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Jenna, please.&amp;quot; Arguing with her wasn&amp;#39;t going to get him anywhere so he decided to beg. Most of the time that&amp;#39;s what she wanted anyway was to see him squirm. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t tell mom and dad.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why shouldn&amp;#39;t I?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Because I&amp;#39;m sorry. I figured it was no big deal. It&amp;#39;s just a stocking.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But it belongs to your sister, you pervert.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not like your foot was in it.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Then why not buy a pair to use to enhance your experience?&amp;quot; She raised her eyebrows, &amp;quot;Hmmm?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I just found it on the floor one day.&amp;quot; He sighed. &amp;quot;I shouldn&amp;#39;t have done it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Did you sniff it?&amp;quot; She smirked&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hell no!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re lying.&amp;quot; The smirk turned into a big smile. &amp;quot;You sniffed it didn&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not answering that.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wonder if dad will ask you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kyle put his head down, &amp;quot;What do you want from me, sis?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The truth. You sniff it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s it matter?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re honest maybe I won&amp;#39;t tell mom and dad.&amp;quot; She waited, but when he didn&amp;#39;t say anything she asked again. &amp;quot;Little brother, did you sniff your big sister&amp;#39;s sweaty stocking?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; he whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What was that?&amp;quot; Jenna put her hand to her ear. &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t hear you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, I sniffed it!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Dirty boy.&amp;quot; She spoke in that teasing tone she&amp;#39;d used on him for as long as he could remember and annoyed the hell out of him. &amp;quot;Did it get you hard?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Get out!&amp;quot; He snapped.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Fine, Mom will be home in an hour.&amp;quot; She started to slide off the desk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Jenna, please. You know they&amp;#39;ll go nuts over this.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Then answer the question.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s an answer right there.&amp;quot; She laughed. &amp;quot;Okay, forget that for now. How about this one. Do I have sexy feet?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sis, that&amp;#39;s...hey!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jenna lifted her leg and put her foot in his face. &amp;quot;Well do I?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re okay I guess.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Just okay?&amp;quot; Jenna wiggled her toes. &amp;quot;With my pretty toe nails and sexy little tattoo?&amp;quot; She slid the side of her foot along his cheek.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stop that.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That rose would make a nice bull&amp;#39;s eye wouldn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Jenna, you&amp;#39;re my sister, knock it off.&amp;quot; He sounded properly upset, but it really wasn&amp;#39;t at her. It was at the fact his body was reacting to her foot touching his face.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You like my feet, don&amp;#39;t you little brother?&amp;quot; She puu her toes inches from his lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; He turned his head, then shivered when she pressed the sole of her foot along his cheek.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, you do.&amp;quot; She insisted &amp;quot;I can see it in your eyes. You like my feet.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Jenna, I...oh, shit!&amp;quot; he gasped when she put her other foot on his crotch. His rapidly swelling crotch." />
