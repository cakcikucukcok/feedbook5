Billionaire&amp;#39;s Experiment&lt;br /&gt;
When Belle finds herself on the doorstep of her new employer, she is utterly terrified, yet hopeful of what her new life will be.

&lt;br /&gt;
Biker&amp;#39;s Experiment&lt;br /&gt;
Cassie stands at the counter and stares at the burly biker in front of her, certain that she is making the worse decision in her life.

&lt;br /&gt;
Fighter&amp;#39;s Experiment&lt;br /&gt;
Beautiful and hardheaded Clarice knows how to handle herself in a fighting ring. She doesn&amp;#39;t surrender easily to any man. Until she crosses path with her boss.

&lt;br /&gt;
Librarian&amp;#39;s Experiment&lt;br /&gt;
Alice is absolutely fine with crushing on the Damien, the sexy French librarian from afar... until her friend threatens to make a move on him.

&lt;br /&gt;
Devil&amp;#39;s Experiment&lt;br /&gt;
Rosie wakes up on a perfect bright morning with little on her mind except getting her boyfriend to marry her so she can finally experience her first time. Except there&amp;#39;re other plans for her.

Excerpt from Billionaire&amp;#39;s Experiment&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I made a sound, something between a moan and a whimper as he leaned closer to me. He was close enough for me to taste him. I drank him in, taking time to appreciate the hard planes of his body, noting the jut of his hips and the outline of well-developed muscles on his thighs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How&amp;#39;re you feeling, Mia?&amp;quot; he asked again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A million thoughts swam through my mind, but none made any sense. &amp;quot;Master Jason,&amp;quot; I mumbled, feeling a tightness grow in my core as I looked up into his eyes. He edged just a little bit closer, filling what little distance there was between us so that our chests were almost touching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Use your words, Mia,&amp;quot; he said. His hands found my shoulders and then tangles in my hair. He combed through my hair as I tried to form words with my tongue. &amp;quot;Tell me how you feel.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hot,&amp;quot; I finally managed. &amp;quot;I feel hot.&amp;quot; It was true. I felt a heat inside me, reaching outwards like tendrils from a rose, capturing every nerve, every skin cell, every organ. It was almost hard to breathe. I felt my body being heavy with need.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Anything else?&amp;quot; he asked. &amp;quot;How does it feel when I do this?&amp;quot; His fingers slid down my inner thigh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh!&amp;quot; I gasped. I shook my head, unable to form the words to answer him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Tell me how much experience you&amp;#39;ve had,&amp;quot; he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;None,&amp;quot; I whispered, thinking that I had already told him that over the phone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not even the basics?&amp;quot; he asked, looking incredibly amused.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve kissed a guy before,&amp;quot; I said, leaning back and crossing my arms over my chest a little defensively.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He threw back his head and laughed so heartily that I felt completely humiliated. I wished I had done more, but it was the truth. I just hadn&amp;#39;t had the time or energy for a relationship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re more innocent than I thought,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Show me,&amp;quot; he said." />
