  <title>Oops! I Banged My Brother! - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every year Hannah&#39;s sorority holds a naughty event called &quot;the lottery.&quot; The girls in the house are matched up with anonymous frat brothers and given one hour to go wild in a seedy motel room. Hannah&#39;s a sweet little freshman who fantasizes about being slutty with a stranger, and her masked man has the passion (and the girth) she&#39;s always craved. There&#39;s just one little problem: He&#39;s her brother!
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
It was 10PM on a Friday night.
I was sitting on the bed in the fugliest motel room I&#39;d ever seen.
I was wearing nothing but a tight black thong and a black mesh shirt. No bra. Did the mask count as clothing? It itched against my skin. A black Mardi Gras mask with black feathers and rhinestones. I told Liz it made me look stupid, but when she saw me in the mesh and the thong she shook her head. &quot;No, honey. He&#39;s not gonna think you look stupid.&quot;
&quot;How long?&quot; I whispered, out of breath from standing still.
&quot;We&#39;re getting everyone organized, making sure they remember the rules and know their room number.&quot;
&quot;Okay.&quot;
&quot;Have fun, Little. Anything goes bad, you just give a yell. It&#39;s only Sig Delts in the motel. We have an arrangement with the manager.&quot;
&quot;Okay.&quot;
She stroked my neck. &quot;Breathe, honey.&quot;
&quot;Okay.&quot;
And then she was gone and I was alone in my fugly motel room. In nothing but a mesh shirt and a thong, and my mask.
Waiting.
Wet, and waiting.
My heart was pounding so hard it made my breasts bounce. I wondered if he&#39;d notice through the mesh. How could he not? Then again, he might just stop breathing when I answered the door. I sat on the edge of the bed with my thighs pressed tightly together, my hands clasped between them, bouncing my feet wondering if I could do this and knowing (I should say flowing) that I wanted this, wanted this with a burning passion.
This was the sluttiest thing I&#39;d ever done and I&#39;d been dreaming about it for weeks. For one night I was free of my usual worries: My grades, my duties, my sisters. For one hour my pleasure was the only item on my menu. Would he be hungry?
When I heard the knock on the door my breath stopped in my throat. I bounced to my feet with a dizzying rush to my head. I swallowed, and took a step. Stopped. I took a deep breath, reflexively smoothed down my shirt, and then laughed at myself. What was there to smooth? My nipples were poking through the mesh - and I could hardly say I was making myself decent. &quot;Remember, girl,&quot; I said, &quot;decent is the last thing you want to be right now.&quot;
Just before I opened the door I readjusted my mask and readied the smile I&#39;d practiced in the mirror all afternoon. Then I opened the door, struck a pose, and flashed my smile.
It had the right effect.
His jaw dropped. I mean literally. He had a nervous smile on his face when I opened the door but it fell right off him (just about when I wiggled) and he was left wide-eyed standing in the doorway.
He was still cute. He was much taller than me, with big broad shoulders, a good chin, and full, kissable lips. His neck wasn&#39;t the meaty kind that belonged atop a linebacker, but it was still thick with muscle. He had a very nice chest. It stretched the fabric of his tight t-shirt, swelling his trunk the way his biceps filled out his short sleeves. Finally, wonder upon wonders, he had kind, beautiful eyes. They were just a shade darker than my own green irises and made me feel like I&#39;d rediscovered a forgotten friend.
When I saw his eyes, I knew this would work.
