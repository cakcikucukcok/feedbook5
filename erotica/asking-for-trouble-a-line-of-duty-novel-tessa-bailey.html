  <title>Asking for Trouble (A Line of Duty Novel) - Tessa Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brent Mason and Hayden Winstead can&#39;t stand each other. She plans exclusive parties for her rich family&#39;s charities. He&#39;s a rough and tumble cop who rigs explosives for a living. Could two people be any less suited for conversation? They think not and prefer to keep it that way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, their two best friends are deeply, disgustingly in love. Forced together, the mutual attraction simmering beneath the surface of Brent and Hayden&#39;s non-relationship grows with every argument until it explodes into a scintillating night of mind-blowing sex. And it won&#39;t be the last, as far as Brent&#39;s concerned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hayden has a secret, though. Her father&#39;s company is relying on a merger to save them from financial ruin, and only Hayden&#39;s marriage to the CEO&#39;s wealthy son can secure the deal. If she&#39;s to protect her family, she&#39;ll have to forget Brent. And he has no intention of being forgotten. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Line of Duty series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Protecting What&#39;s His&lt;br&gt;* Officer Off Limits&lt;br&gt;* Asking for Trouble&lt;br&gt;* Staking His Claim&lt;br&gt;* Protecting What&#39;s Theirs&lt;/p&gt;" />
