  <title>Exes and Excess - Kendra Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Felicia marries Todd Wilson, she is only eighteen, and he is just twenty--both young, nave, and sexually inexperienced.

&lt;p&gt;With the help of her friends, Felicia now begins a journey toward her erotic awakening, seeking out new experiences with men and getting herself back into the world. Because of her navety and inability to recognize when she is being used, she continually finds herself in trouble and unable to distinguish among love, lust, and commitment. But because of her passion and exuberance, Felicia leaves no man unchanged after her various encounters. And one man is determined to make her his own--no matter the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this erotic novel, a newly divorced young woman explores her options with various men as she searches for both temporary pleasure and lasting happiness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
