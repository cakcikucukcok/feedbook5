  <title>If He Only Knew... (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) - Debbi Rawlins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="

          &lt;strong&gt;She seemed like the perfect lady! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As far as New York City attorney Cody Shea could see, Sara Wells was a model temp. She had brains and beauty–in fact, if he hadn&#39;t been her boss, there were a few highly improper things he would have asked the very proper Southern belle to do…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Living in Manhattan under an assumed name for a year was Sara&#39;s brief flirtation with freedom. Now back in her natural habitat, she&#39;s prepared to marry a gentleman whose pedigree and fortune match her own. She&#39;s even accepted that she&#39;ll probably spend a lifetime fantasizing about the exquisite pleasure of being a tigress in her boss&#39;s bed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Imagine if he only knew! Well, Cody is about to find out. His trip to Atlanta to seduce her causes bedlam as Sara tries to keep her faux identity and her lustful feelings intact… And fails!&lt;/p&gt;
