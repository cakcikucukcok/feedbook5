&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Snow Maid&lt;br /&gt;
Bill Carter was starving and dying of exposure when he fell asleep by the standing stone in the Russian Arctic. Sacrificing his life to save his friends, he never expected to wake up, warm, safe and healed, in the presence of the immortal Snow Maid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Polina had been alone for decades, her youth slowly draining away as belief in her faded in the world above. She had taken Bill&amp;#39;s life in trade for those of his companions. Will the heat of their passion ignite an eternal love, or are the differences between them too great?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tamarin&amp;rsquo;s Awakening&lt;br /&gt;
Professor Brody Wyman had lusted after pretty Tamarin for years, ever since the summer he&amp;rsquo;d accidentally glimpsed her skinny-dipping down in the creek beyond her family&amp;rsquo;s farm. But he never dared to cross that forbidden line between fantasy and reality&amp;hellip;until her father was killed in a tragic accident, and she turned to him for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sexy Little Runaway&lt;br /&gt;
Hawke had been living alone for so many years that he&amp;rsquo;d almost forgotten how incredible sex could be. Now he wasn&amp;rsquo;t alone anymore&amp;mdash;not since he&amp;rsquo;d found a ragged little runaway hiding in his barn, and realized that she was an outrageously sexy teenage girl!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having sex really was like riding a bike. No matter how long it had been, your body remembered. And his was coming alive again with a vengeance! How long could he manage to keep his hands off her, before hot lust tore him apart?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt from Sexy Little Runaway:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hawke waited until she was gone, then turned the water to icy cold and splashed it across his sweating face. Touching her had been a big mistake. A huge mistake. Now he was going to be hard all night, and he hadn&amp;rsquo;t suffered that particular malady in too many years to count.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;rsquo;d have to take care of the problem himself, in the privacy of his own bedroom, because for sure he couldn&amp;rsquo;t turn to her for comfort. Someone had abused that poor little kid, and he wasn&amp;rsquo;t about to compound it by forcing himself on her. No matter how desperately he ached to do just that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The pots and pans could wait. If he didn&amp;rsquo;t take care of this little...check that, big...problem right away, he was likely to do something he shouldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His legs were a little unsteady as he hurried back to his bedroom, and that was something he hadn&amp;rsquo;t experienced in a long, long time, either. Who could have guessed that, at his age, he could feel as horny as a teenage boy lusting after his first soft girl again?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Never should have turned yourself into a hermit, he thought once his door was securely closed, and he could unzip his worn jeans with a soft moan of relief. You&amp;rsquo;re too old for seduction, and too young for a second childhood. So where does that leave you?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Panting in his room like an eager virgin as he wrapped his callused fingers around the big chunk of meat that had made his Anna Maria sigh with blissful pleasure. Helluva time it had picked to rise from the dead!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beating off really was like riding a bike, though, he realized as familiar pleasure began to spiral through his veins. Once you learned, it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter how old you were. You never truly forgot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Heat rose in a shocking tidal wave. Why on earth had he ever stopped doing this? Why had he denied himself the amazing pleasure of physical release?" />
