  <title>Just 4 Play (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) - Cindi Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Jill Sheldon believes in having fun every day. That&#39;s why she works at Just 4 Play, an adult toy store.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What&#39;s more fun than helping people enjoy sex? And if there was ever someone in need of some playtime, it&#39;s her hot new boss, Mitch Landry. He&#39;s determined to close the place. So she propositions him–give her one month to demonstrate the value of the store…on him. After all, there&#39;s a lot of pleasure she can pack into thirty days!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mitch knows how to have fun–he just has too many responsibilities to indulge himself. Yet when the seductive Jill makes her tantalizing proposal, he&#39;s tempted. She won&#39;t change his mind, but he can enjoy himself for one month, can&#39;t he?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What starts out as a steamy little game soon turns into so much more, and there&#39;s no way he can stop playing. So he&#39;ll have to change the stakes to something along the lines of forever….&lt;/p&gt;
