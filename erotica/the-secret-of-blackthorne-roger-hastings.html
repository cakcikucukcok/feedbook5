  <title>The Secret of Blackthorne - Roger Hastings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thus begins the first book in the new Blackthorne House series. Come to this half-mansion, half-prison, perched on a lonely crag surrounded by the moors of Scotland. Here secrets are concealed behind stone walls and iron bars, and escape is never possible. Join in with the forbidden revelries in the ancestral home of the Cailean family. From every­where in Europe and America beautiful young girls are abducted and brought here, to be imprisoned in the cellar chambers, where they are stripped naked and taught to obey. The familys staff of powerful men and severe women train their defenseless victims with whips and cruel devices, these lovely subjects soon yield their bodies to the familys relentless carnal appetites. Seen through the eyes of the newest Laird of Blackthorne, Sir Richard tells of his amazing introductionand most erotic initiation into the world that he will rule. He soon delights in the lusty female slaves there to serve his every sexual desire. Though his enlightening education into his family heritage also reveals how once each year, the tables are turned on the Cailean family, as the spirited men and women of this remarkable clan must submit to a night of terror. Riding into the mysterious circle of stones hidden in the estate forest, they discover for themselves a secret world of feral lust and frenzy at the hands of the very slaves they have so carefully trained." />
