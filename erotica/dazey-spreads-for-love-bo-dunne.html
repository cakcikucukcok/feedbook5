  <title>Dazey Spreads For Love - Bo Dunne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beautiful Dazey blows her boyfriend but can&amp;#39;t wait around. She has an ache between her legs for her grownup younger brothers. Back home, Dazey finds one of her brothers. Mom wakes up from a nap, very lonely, as Dazey spreads her legs for Dane. Dazey brings Mom to join them, then two more brothers come home. Julia has never had an interlude with any of her sons before.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time Dazey pulled up on the little street in the GatorTail Trailer Park where she had grown up, a late afternoon Florida squall came in overhead. The billowing gray clouds unloaded a warm rain on a light breeze. Delighted, Dazey got out of her car with her shoulder bag and leaned back to feel the rain on her face. To her, this was home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She glanced around to see if any neighbors were nearby, but no one was in sight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On a whim, she yanked the long, orange tank top off over her head, letting her firm, 38D boobs bounce as they caught the light rain. Though she was aware that some of the neighbors might be watching out their windows, she loved standing in the warm rain wearing only her sandals. Smiling with lighthearted, naughty enjoyment, she walked up the home-made wooden steps to the front porch of the double-wide trailer, letting her butt sway in an exaggerated, sexy walk. If any male neighbors were watching, she was happy to let them enjoy the moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was glad her mother still lived here with her four younger brothers. The boys were working and saving money to buy Mom a real house someday. With the strap to her purse on one shoulder, she swung the drenched tank top over her other shoulder and reached for the doorknob.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The door opened and her youngest brother, Dane, stood back from the doorway. &amp;quot;Hi, Sis!&amp;quot; He laughed and took a long, leisurely gaze from her windblown, straw blonde hair to her face down to her boobs and her shapely legs. &amp;quot;I heard your car door slam.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dazey watched his eyes take in the sight of her, and enjoyed every moment. Her heart beat faster as he blatantly moved his gaze back up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Come on in, silly,&amp;quot; said Dane, moving to give her room. He wore light-weight blue nylon running shorts and a white tank top that was loose on his buff body. Dane was twenty-one years old and the black sheep of the family. A wild tangle of shoulder-length, dirty blond hair framed his long, square-jawed face and some tattoos were scattered up and down his arms. On one earlobe, he wore a silver earring in the shape of a hand giving the finger. He leaned close as he pushed the door shut.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dazey stepped inside, dropped her purse and her tank top to the floor, and went up on tiptoe to give him a quick kiss on the lips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re all wet, Daze, but you&amp;#39;re as hot as ever.&amp;quot;" />
