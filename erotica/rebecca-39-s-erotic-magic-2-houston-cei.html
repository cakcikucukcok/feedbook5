~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carly had met Angelina for the first time only two days earlier and could not stop thinking about her beauty and charming personality. Angelina was so involved in catching up with family and old friends that Carly did not have the opportunity to spend as much time with her as she had hoped. This particular day, Carly planned for it to be different. Angelina cheerfully accepted Carly&amp;#39;s invitation to get to know each other, as she had put it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carly waited patiently in her mini-skirt with a tie-in-the-front blouse. She could not help but imagine an image in her mind of how Angelina would look so attired. Angelina showed up in a tight skirt that was not as short as Carly&amp;#39;s but was still flattering to her smooth-skinned, shapely legs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After an embrace and some small talk, Angelina said, &amp;quot;I wanted to spend more time with you the other day but I couldn&amp;#39;t break away from family. I&amp;#39;m very glad you called and I have a situation and need to talk to someone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carly liked her tone that seemed like she wanted to be good friends,&amp;quot; Carly said. &amp;quot;You may talk to me about anything.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thanks, Carly. It&amp;#39;s kinda serious but I can deal with it. I&amp;#39;m pleased that you and my brother are getting married. Maybe he&amp;#39;s shared more of your relationship than he should have but anyway, I know that you are sexually liberal as he, of course is but, but that&amp;#39;s a good thing. May I go on?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Certainly,&amp;quot; Carly said, &amp;quot;especially after you&amp;#39;ve said that&amp;#39;s a good thing.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They both chuckled and Angelina continued, &amp;quot;I get a lot of compliments now and offer to go out but that was not always the case. I was homely in my early high school years and of course didn&amp;#39;t learn much about boys, but then I later developed.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Boy, did you ever!&amp;quot; Carly exclaimed in jest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Angelina smiled brightly and said, &amp;quot;Thanks, Carly. I started dating a little but didn&amp;#39;t let myself get too involved. There was one Christmas break when I came home from the dorm and had a great visit but the day before I was to return to college, my brother made a pass at me. Well, I let him know clearly that I would not do anything like that, and you know, Carly, he apologized and everything was okay. He told me that he and our mother were having occasional sex. I was almost floored when he said that Dad approved. Then, he told me about Mom and Dad doing some wife swapping and Josh has shared some girlfriends with both of them. You know, threesomes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Carly continued to listen intently, Angelina was surprised to see that her interest did not indicate an element of shock as she continued her narrative, &amp;quot;Well, by the time I was a senior in college, I had more experience in life, if you know what I mean, and now that I&amp;#39;m back home for good, I think I have not necessarily a new attitude but an adjusted one.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay, girl, I sense that it&amp;#39;s coming to a head.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, it is. The head&amp;#39; as you put it is why I&amp;#39;m bringing all this up,&amp;quot; Angelina said. &amp;quot;Yesterday, I spoke to my mother to say that I would be okay with a little experimentation within the family. My words drew a blank face at first, but then she smiled, threw her arms around me and kissed me hard on the lips with her tongue in my mouth. As I was almost motionless..." />
