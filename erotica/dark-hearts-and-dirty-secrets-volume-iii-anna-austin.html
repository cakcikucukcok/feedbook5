      <meta name="description" content="Victorian BDSM Collection&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Behind the facade of piety and respectability, the true face of Victorian England was rather more...dirty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Story 1: Tupping the Milkmaid&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Story 2: Debasing the Farm Girl&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Story 3: Exploiting the Maid&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lightning flashed across the sky and a peal of thunder shook the barn, causing the already anxious cows to shift. Daisy patted the cow in front of her to keep it calm. Outside, large raindrops fell down upon the dirt of the corral, prompting the two young men to run for shelter into the barn. They stopped as they entered, looking around at the livestock until their eye settled on Daisy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t act foolish, girl. Daisy could not believe that she was here now, alone in the barn with Simon and his servant. The two of them walked over to her and she wondered what would be the right and proper thing to say. She hated that she had never been around them. She should be calm and casual, used to his presence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I hope we&amp;#39;re not bothering your work,&amp;quot; Simon said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Daisy looked down at the bucket of milk, nearly full. It was full enough anyway and this was the last cow she had to tend to today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not at all, Master Simon.&amp;quot; Daisy stood and gave a curtsey. She picked up the bucket and carried it over to one of the large milk jugs, pouring it carefully inside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wilfred said something that Daisy could not quite discern and she wondered if she should be embarrassed, flattered, or simply uninterested. She did not like feeling awkward.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t have to be so formal,&amp;quot; Simon said. Daisy could hear a hint of playfulness in his voice. &amp;quot;Master will do fine.&amp;quot;" />
