  <title>Big Gray Men - Ella Louise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Seemingly alone at home, Cathy has an experience that is truly out of this world. After shivering and convulsing with pleasure from an unidentified bright light in the sky, she goes on a quest to find the source of this unexpected feeling. But when she stumbles on a ship with three hot gray humanoids inside that want to examine her body, Cathy knows she&amp;#39;s in for the hottest ride in the universe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the aliens walks over to what I could swear is a completely blank space of white wall and opens it like a door. From inside the opening, he retrieves a monitor to hook up to my electrode wires and a tray of medical-looking equipment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My eyes go wide at the sight of not one but two objects that I think are used as speculums.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, what have I gotten myself into&amp;hellip;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One set of gray hands holds my shoulders down, another pries my thighs apart and holds them there, and the third pair of hands picks up one of the speculums.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I grit my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The metal of the speculum is as sharply cold as that of the table as it parts the folds of my lips and slides inside me. I&amp;rsquo;m well-lubricated, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from feeling like I&amp;rsquo;m getting a pelvic exam. I inhale sharply as the speculum opens, prying my walls apart and holding me open, on display.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I can feel my juices running from my wide-open pussy with nothing to stop the drips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the second speculum is picked up, I have to close my eyes and steady myself. I know where it&amp;rsquo;s going." />
