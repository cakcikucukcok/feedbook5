  <title>Caught Fucking Daddy&#39;s Horse - Studly Stallion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ava&amp;rsquo;s father forbids her to see any men. Even though she&amp;rsquo;s 18, as long as she&amp;rsquo;s under his roof, she&amp;rsquo;s forbidden to date them, talk to them or have any kind of relationship with them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But he didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about a horse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How will Ava&amp;rsquo;s overbearing father react when he catches his stallion&amp;rsquo;s cock deep in her throat?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Daddy! How could you!&amp;quot; Ava screamed at her father as her wimpy boyfriend raced away in his car.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve told you before. Just because you&amp;#39;re 18 doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you can ignore the curfew or stand out here kissing a guy in the night.&amp;quot; Her daddy said in a cold, deep voice that brooked no disagreement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Daddy, you won&amp;#39;t let me see any guys unless I sneak out at night. At least he was decent enough to bring me home.&amp;quot; Ava said, folding her arms across her ample breasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want you seeing guys I don&amp;#39;t approve of. I&amp;#39;m not letting you see anymore young men until you&amp;#39;re at least 21 or move out of this house!&amp;quot; He growled in his deepest, most intimidating voice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why won&amp;#39;t you let me see guys, anyway? What&amp;#39;s wrong with that?&amp;quot; Ava said hating her daddy&amp;#39;s strict attitude. Wasn&amp;#39;t it natural for a woman like her to be attracted to guys?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not ready to go see guys, Ava. You need to date one guy and settle down with him. I want you to live your life, instead of having guys on your mind all the time.&amp;quot; He told her, pointing inside the house like she was some type of dog that should obey him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Daddy, do you want me to fall in love with women and make love to them instead? Would that be better for you?&amp;quot; Ava shouted even louder, before spinning around and racing off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She ripped open the stable door and stormed inside, causing Red to snort in surprise at her entrance. Wiping away her hot tears, she cuddled the stallion&amp;#39;s head in her arms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was the only one that could comfort her now from the confrontation. Confusion rolled around in her brain like a dust devil as emotions clashed within her heart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She didn&amp;#39;t know why her father was acting this way, but it had stop. Why couldn&amp;#39;t she be with a guy? She was 18 after all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Red stood there, munching on his hay as he swished his tail. In the dim light, she saw his large, long cock hanging down as he relaxed." />
