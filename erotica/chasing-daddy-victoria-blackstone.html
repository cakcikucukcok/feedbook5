  <title>Chasing Daddy - Victoria Blackstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Some girls chase boys, some chase other girls. Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned I&amp;rsquo;m not terribly picky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
As the days passed, I became more and more distracted, unable to think of anything but my father. I stared at him almost constantly; at his lips and at his hands, and as he came from the shower just now, at his chest. He&amp;rsquo;s everything the boys at school aren&amp;rsquo;t: manly and sexy and mature and loving. I caught up to him just as he entered their room, and wrapped my arms around his waist, pressing myself to his back, my cheek on his shoulder. He&amp;rsquo;d stopped, and it was obvious he was nervous.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Angela...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I just want a hug,&amp;rdquo; I whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He blew out a quiet breath and, a moment later, turned, pulling me to him, and kissed the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Warm,&amp;rdquo; I whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;A good shower tends to do that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I moved my cheek against the hair on his chest. &amp;ldquo;You smell nice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He moved to pull away. &amp;ldquo;Come on, sweetheart, I need to get dressed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Want help?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He laughed nervously. &amp;ldquo;No, sweetheart, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s a good idea.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I lowered my gaze to his stomach, to the trail of hair that disappeared beneath the towel, and slowly I reached out to run my nails over the skin there, the soft hair mesmerizing me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Angela...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shook my head, my gaze on my hand as I reached for the towel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Baby, please,&amp;rdquo; he whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again I shook my head, pulling slowly, watching, fascinated, as the towel fell, his penis springing up a bit, bouncing where it hung, heavy. I reached out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Baby, no.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I ignored him as I touched a fingertip to it, but I pulled away when it jerked up against my hand. I smiled as, again, I reached out again. Again it twitched. I lifted my gaze. I wanted to see his eyes, to watch his reaction the first time I touched it. I bit my lip as my fingers wrapped around it, as I squeezed, gently. &amp;ldquo;Warm,&amp;rdquo; I whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shook his head. &amp;ldquo;Sweetheart...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I moved then, my gaze dropping to his lips, my eyes closing as I pressed mine to them, my hand still squeezing him, my heart racing as he began to harden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt her hands on my shoulders, pulling at me, gently, and I broke the kiss, my gaze on his, his on my mother&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Come on, sweetheart,&amp;rdquo; she said, her tone soft.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I released him, though it was the last thing I wanted to do, and as she turned me, directing me out into the hall, I turned my head, my gaze on his penis, now sticking out at a low angle, swaying gently. When at last the wall came between us, I shook myself out of my daze. She brought me to my room and sat me on my bed, her hand coming up, the backs of her fingers caressing my cheek. &amp;ldquo;So beautiful,&amp;rdquo; she whispered. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re going to give him a heart attack.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
