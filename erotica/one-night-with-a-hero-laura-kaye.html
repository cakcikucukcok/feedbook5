Brady Scott vowed never to marry or have kids. Sent stateside to get his head on straight--and his anger in check--Brady&#39;s looking for a distraction. He finds it in his beautiful new neighbor&#39;s one-night-only offer for hot sex, but her ability to make him forget is addictive. Suddenly, Brady&#39;s not so sure he can stay away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;...what they need is each other. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orphaned as a child, community center director Joss Daniels swore she&#39;d never put herself in a position to be left behind again, but she can&#39;t deny herself one sizzling night with the sexy soldier who makes her laugh and kisses her senseless. When Joss discovers she&#39;s pregnant, Brady&#39;s rejection leaves her feeling abandoned. Now, they must overcome their fears before they lose the love and security they&#39;ve found in each other, but can they let go of the past to create a future together?&lt;/p&gt;" />
