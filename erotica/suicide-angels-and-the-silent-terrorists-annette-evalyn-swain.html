  <title>Suicide Angels and the Silent Terrorists - Annette Evalyn Swain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Annie grew up in a big, supportive family. She grew up happy and confident with a strong faith in God. The darker side of the world was never shown to her as a child, and as she grew into a bright young woman, the darker side continued to remain hidden from her view. When she earned a job at a nursing home, Annie felt lucky. What a blessing to have a job that allowed her to help others on a day to day basis!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But soon, things went wrong at her new job. Suicides became rampant among Annies coworkers - women who had previously seemed joyful and at peace. What could possibly cause such emotionally stable women to take their own lives? When Annie meets her boss, Benson, she begins to suspect hes behind it especially when she is sexually harassed by this man who was supposed to be a guiding force at The Lake View Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annie soon learns of the darkness in the world. She learns that bullying is not confined to playgrounds and schools; bullying happens to adults, too, especially in the guise of sexual harassment. Annie will not let Benson ruin her faith in the goodness of people. With Gods help, Annie will recover the lost souls ruined by suicide. She will show them the light and save herself in the process. &lt;/p&gt;" />
