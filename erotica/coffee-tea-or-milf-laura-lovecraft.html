  <title>Coffee, Tea, or MILF? - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cory is upset. First he has to give up his room and sleep in the crappy spare room downstairs because his mother&#39;s friend Savannah from Texas is coming to stay for a few weeks. 
But a bigger problem is Cory is having trouble with girls. Since breaking up with his high school sweetheart and the only girl he had ever slept with, Donna, he has lost his confidence. Even when the girl is more than ready to go, he shies away afraid he won&#39;t be able to. 
But things are going to change and for the better because Savannah is a recently divorced smoking hot redheaded Milf who is more than ready to show a good looking young man exactly how to please a woman!
