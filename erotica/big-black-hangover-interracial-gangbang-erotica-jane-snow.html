  <title>Big Black Hangover (Interracial Gangbang Erotica) - Jane Snow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Carrie wakes up in an unfamiliar room, completely naked and surrounded by big black men, all knocked out.  She can barely remember how she got to the hotel room and soon, memories of the previous night begin to flood her.  After quietly getting up to find her clothes, she stumbled upon a camera revealing the chain of events.
Before she even has a chance to step out, a black man walked out of the bathroom and says hello.  Carrie is embarrassed and tries to head out but one by one, the big black men start waking up and approaching her.  When she sees their massive members, she hesitates.
They remind her that she&#39;s in Las Vegas and &quot;What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas,&quot; before they toss her clothes over to her.  Carrie contemplates as her eyes flick from one big black man to another.  She decides she&#39;ll stay and go through this big black hangover by experiencing what she went through the night before.  But as the six big black men surround her, she begins to wonder how she was able to survive the previous night..." />
