  <title>Debasing The Farm Girl - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lord Augustus Ravenwood likes his women to be subservient, and he likes to share them. He and his manservant, Soames, like nothing more to despoil innocence and debase virtue.&lt;br /&gt;
And now, they have a perfect opportunity....&lt;br /&gt;
Gloria is a farmgirl, eighteen, and pure. But not for long - Lord Ravenwood and Soames intend to have their wicked way with her - hard, fast and without protection!&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And what is your name, my dear.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;G-Gloria,&amp;rdquo; she stuttered nervously.&lt;br /&gt;
I frowned and addressed her sternly. &amp;ldquo;Gloria, you will address me as &amp;#39;Milord,&amp;#39; do you understand? If you omit my title again I shall have to put you over my knee and spank you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She blushed a deep red, her eyes fixed on the ground. &amp;ldquo;Yes, Milord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
I nodded. &amp;ldquo;Good. Tell me a little of your life, Gloria.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She looked surprised at such a request, but a glance at my face showed that I was in earnest.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;T-there is very little to tell, Milord. I was born here on your estate, and I have lived my whole life here. My father is a good man, although he sometime drinks a little too much. My mother died a year ago of the smallpox. I have no brother or sisters, though I wish I did. I have a little kitten who I have named Tabby.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
In truth, her life story was rather tedious. I doubt she had many stories to tell. Perhaps it was time to expand her experience of the world." />
