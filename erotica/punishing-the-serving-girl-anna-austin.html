  <title>Punishing The Serving Girl - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ginny had one moment of madness, but that was all it took. She tried to steal the Earl&amp;#39;s money, and now he owns her, body and soul. Every night, he uses her for his pleasure, and he isn&amp;#39;t gentle.&lt;br /&gt;
To complicate matters, the Earl&amp;#39;s valet has feelings for Ginny, and she for him. Will she get her man? Or will she end up being shared by the valet and his master?&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Aha, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t my imagination that I saw you eyeing my pocket book earlier on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
At the Earl&amp;rsquo;s voice, Ginny gasped and turned swiftly. The man was standing blocking the door, his arms across his chest. Terror gripped her and she couldn&amp;rsquo;t move. Bloody hell, there was no way she would be able to get out of this without being sent to Newgate or worse, hanged! Not when he had caught her with the evidence in her hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;My lord,&amp;rdquo; she croaked.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;My lord, indeed,&amp;rdquo; he said walking toward her.&lt;br /&gt;
It was too dark to see the expression on his face but she could hear the biting fury in his voice. She backed up until the back of her knees hit into the bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh please have mercy my lord,&amp;rdquo; she begged, horrified at the thought of spending the rest of her life in the lice and vermin infested prison of Newgate. She threw herself down at his feet and clutched his boots. Maybe if she begged and explained her circumstances he would have mercy on her.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Get up!&amp;rdquo; he ordered her, and with his hands under her arms, he pulled her roughly to her feet.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;My lord, I desperately needed the money,&amp;rdquo; she babbled. &amp;ldquo;I just wanted to get away from here. Please, my lord. I will do anything. Don&amp;rsquo;t send me to Newgate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hmm,&amp;rdquo; he seemed to mull over in his mind. &amp;ldquo;There is something that may be able to work in your favor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, my lord. Anything.&amp;rdquo;" />
