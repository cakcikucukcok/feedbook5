  <title>Sexting Mom - Kaye Bee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Her snooping was only to protect her son from getting into trouble with a new thing kids were doing called &amp;ldquo;sexting.&amp;rdquo; The graphic images she finds transforms their relationship in ways this single mom couldn&amp;rsquo;t have imagined. Once her son starts texting her, inhibitions fall away and they begin sharing intimacies they never would have said face-to-face. Will these exchanges lead to more than just a few inappropriate texts between mother and son?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
The fact that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had sexual intercourse with a man in over three years was no excuse. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have found someone to fuck me, if that&amp;rsquo;s what I wanted. Sure, I was getting up there, but for a woman in her mid-forties I was holding up quite well, thank you very much. Of course, there were some fine lines showing around my eyes these days, and I had to pluck the occasional gray from my shoulder-length, mahogany-brown hair, but I had no complaints about my body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, if I was perfectly capable of getting sex, why was I standing there in the middle of the night with an almost manic need to once again see my boy&amp;rsquo;s strapping young penis? Could it simply be that this was nothing more than a convenient outlet for the sexual cravings I&amp;rsquo;d been suppressing for so many years? It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that I was sexually attracted to my son as it was merely a carnal reaction to a rather impressive appendage. My finger hovered over the power button of Eric&amp;rsquo;s phone. Was I the kind of person that would so easily toss aside her morals for a cheap thrill that bordered on being criminal?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The impassioned muscles of my pussy flexed involuntarily as if in response to my silent question. I pressed the power button. My hand shook with yearning anticipation as I waiting for the darned gizmo to power up. It seemed to take forever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I quickly navigated into the photo album and paged through the pictures in an eager frenzy. And there it was. That gorgeous cock. I felt a tingle pulse through my nipples, and my pussy clenched longingly at the sight of it. Okay, so now what? There I was, looking at a very private picture of my son&amp;rsquo;s penis &amp;ndash; a picture I&amp;rsquo;m sure he never in a million years thought his mother would ever see. But what was the ultimate point of me doing this? It&amp;rsquo;s not as if I would ever do something creepy&amp;hellip;like get myself off while looking at my own son&amp;rsquo;s cock. Even though it was such a nice cock. The more I gazed at it the more it almost began to seem like a waste not to fully enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I knew at that moment that my attempts at resistance were useless. I could feel how hard my clit was without even having to touch it. This was truly perverse, I knew, but no one would ever know. What would be the harm in taking a little innocent pleasure from his pictures? He&amp;rsquo;d never be the wiser, and I obviously just needed to get it out of my system, then I could forget all about this foolishness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I set the phone on the coffee table, lifted my nightgown, and pulled down my panties. I tucked them under the sofa cushion so they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be out in the open in case Eric woke up and came out to the living room for some reason. I squatted down and looked at the picture again, leaving the phone resting on the corner of the coffee table. I let my hands drift down my body and gave myself over to the sick lust that was polluting me." />
