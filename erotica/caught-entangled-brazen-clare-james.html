  <title>Caught (Entangled Brazen) - Clare James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sexy category romance from Entangled&#39;s Brazen imprint...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;She was hired to clean up his image. He wants nothing more than to get her dirty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Watching sex tapes at the office is just part of PR professional Vivian Blake&#39;s job, especially when she has to clean up a celebrity&#39;s image. Except that her newest client isn&#39;t quite that easy. Racecar driver Jarod Cage is beyond hot, and his onscreen &quot;performance&quot; is already compromising Viv&#39;s cool professionalism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Jarod hasn&#39;t exactly been discreet about his personal life, he never thought his reputation could cost him both his sponsor and his racing career. Now he has to put his future in the hands of a tiny, pixie-like publicist. Which is becoming a problem, because the heat between them is about to redline. But when you go this hard and fast, putting on the brakes is the most dangerous thing you can do...&lt;/p&gt;" />
