      <meta name="description" content="The Devil&amp;#39;s Daughter has taken John. His wish fulfilled, who will get the first taste of his new equipment? His sexy twin? Or his MILFy mom?

Life is fun when you&amp;rsquo;re hanging with &amp;quot;The Devil&amp;#39;s Daughter!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jasmine turned to her cousin. &amp;ldquo;You did this to him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I did.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A wild hope flared in her heart. &amp;ldquo;Could you&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Could I do it for you?&amp;rdquo; Morgan smiled at her sweetly, happiness plain in her eyes. &amp;ldquo;Of course I could! I love you, Jasmine. And I want you to be happy. Of course, there would be a price. For both of you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;For both of us?&amp;rdquo; John asked. &amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I am sure you remember, Johnny.&amp;rdquo; Morgan tugged at the hem of her shirt. Unresisting, Jasmine let her pull it off. The warm air of the room made her body tingle. &amp;ldquo;For the transformation to work, we need power. And sex is a powerful force that can be used for both the light and the powers of darkness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I used to it to transform your penis. And now I need it to help give your sister the breasts she has always desired.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh. So we&amp;rsquo;re going to screw again? No problem,&amp;rdquo; John said eagerly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, Johnny. Not me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Jasmine.&amp;rdquo;" />
