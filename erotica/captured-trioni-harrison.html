  <title>Captured - Trioni Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Anjou Royale returns from Kingston, she vows to put her past behind her. After purchasing a condo and joining her familys business, she seems to finally emerge from the shadows of her ex-fianc, Adam. Still, she cannot help but wonder if she has really recovered from the trauma of feeling inferior and unworthy after Adams parents judged her based on the color of her skin.
There is no question Anjou is disillusioned with the idea of loveuntil she meets the drop-dead gorgeous Dandr Neilson. Although he has experienced his own betrayals, he always dreamed of falling in love with the perfect woman. As their eyes lock, an electric charge is ignited that fuels his plan to convince a reluctant Anjou to go out with him. Even as desire flows through her core like hot lava, Anjou must decide if she can really release her past hurts and embrace a future with Dandr, who is grappling with his own questions as to whether he is really a capturer of love or a captive of love instead.
In this contemporary romance, a Jamaican woman on a quest to let go of her past betrayals is led straight into the arms of a gorgeous man intent on capturing her heart." />
