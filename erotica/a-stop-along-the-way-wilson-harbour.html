  <title>A Stop Along The Way - Wilson Harbour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
While on the campaign trail a respected Congressman makes a fateful stop alongside a deserted road that will forever change his life as he knows it. It had been days since he felt the sweet release of cumming, his balls swollen greatly with his potent seed. What he does to relieve his frustrations is not only shocking, it could cost him everything he&amp;#39;s worked for... a tale of forbidden lust between man and animal, with a surprising outcome...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
He was on an isolated road at the moment, one where there were few structures miles apart, mostly derelict, and with no sign of life other than the occasional wildlife that popped up on the overgrown roadside. But it was on this road where he found the solution to his maddening lust, unintentionally and at this point he was willing to go further than his morals and inhibitions would allow. It had never crossed his mind before today but after spotting his salvation up ahead the Congressmen didn&amp;#39;t think twice, or consider the dire consequences of his actions if he was to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a miracle. He double checked just to be sure before pulling off on a little dirt road that led up to a spot that was heavily surrounded by trees and overgrown bushes and brush. He couldn&amp;#39;t believe what he had found out here all by itself beside an old shed that was falling in on itself, obviously abandoned to rot to ruin. He eyed what had just caught his attention moments ago, determined to follow through with his savage intentions. Grazing beside the shed on tall grass was a very young ewe, one he found beyond tempting at the moment, and one that appeared old enough for him to catch and fuck. His cock throbbed painfully in his pants at the mere thought of slipping inside the creatures tender hole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He parked his car out of the way so to not be spotted from the road and unbuckled himself, his restrained cock agonized as he slipped out, stretching his pants so much now that it was impossible for him to hide his ailment. He couldn&amp;#39;t meet with people in this state. Maybe this little adorable blessing was meant to be. How could he not take the opportunity that was presenting itself if it meant relieving his ravenous needs so to go forth and do his work with a peaceful mind. He slowly made his approach, sure not to frighten the little creature that didn&amp;#39;t seem alarmed by his presence. Maybe it was used to people. He managed to get right up next to it before it even looked his way, continuing to graze as if a man in a black suit was part of the norm in these parts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hi there...&amp;rdquo; His voice was sweet and the Congressman was as gentle as can be as he knelt and took a hold of the small animal, easy with it as he lifted it in his arms. The sheep stirred a bit but obviously had been handled often as it didn&amp;#39;t struggle or even make a sound other than the chewing on the grass. He smiled at it, stepping back towards the open door to the shed, one that was off its hinges and half resting on the outer wall. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;#39;s it... I won&amp;#39;t hurt you...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was an animal lover after all, though he had never taken that fact as far as he was about to with this little creature. Fucking an animal was something you joked about with your friends, one usually hearing of a guy who had tried it though it was obviously a tall tale. Today he would literally become that dude that fucked a sheep, wondering what his old buddies would say about that if they only knew...&lt;br /&gt;
