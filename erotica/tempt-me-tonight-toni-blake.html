  <title>Tempt Me Tonight - Toni Blake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He was her first:  the first man she longed for, the first man she truly desired. Then he betrayed her and broke her heart. Now her revenge will be oh-so-sweet . . . and hot!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trish Henderson has returned home to Eden to take care of some family business . . . and some personal business, as well. Though she&#39;s achieved remarkable success as a high-powered Chicago attorney, Trish has never forgotten her small-town high school sweetheart, Joe Ramsey, or the devastation of heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now she&#39;s come face-to-face with the gorgeous sex god Joe has grown into, and she&#39;s determined to get him out of her system once and for all&amp;#8212;and maybe take a little revenge, too. And this time, &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; has all the power. After all, where is it written that only &lt;em&gt;men&lt;/em&gt; can explore and enjoy a physical relationship without commitment? Her plan: seduce him for just one night, then walk away . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there&#39;s just one problem. Trish is about to find out that one night with Joe may never be enough . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
