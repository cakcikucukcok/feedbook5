  <title>Come On Down - Susan Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Wolf In Human Clothing is a steamy paranormal short story, and is about what happens when things get out of control in a store dressing room and a man that a woman is about to have intimacy with, changes into something entirely non-human. Customers run off screaming as the werewolf leaps over them and runs out the door. Later, he tells her how it all came about from an encounter with a male werewolf and that he&#39;s trying his best to control the metamorphosis when it does happens. She risks seeing him again to learn just how much control he does have over the process.   Dude, Your Fangs Are Huge, is the story of a woman who meets someone new, and they hit it off - until she hears something in the kitchen that evening and sees a large animal eating their leftover steaks. After calling 911 and the animal disappears, she finds her new boyfriend has an additional bonus when he doesn&#39;t balk at going shopping in the mall, but a little while later, she finds out what he&#39;s really like." />
