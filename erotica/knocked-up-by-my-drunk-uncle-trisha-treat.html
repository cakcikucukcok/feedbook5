  <title>Knocked Up By My Drunk Uncle - Trisha Treat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="18 year old Tia&#39;s parents know she is boy crazy, so they send her to her Uncle Ronnie&#39;s while they are away so that she won&#39;t be &quot;knocked up before the weekend is over&quot; as her Dad puts it. From the moment she arrives, her drunkard Uncle can&#39;t keep his eyes off of her hot, young body. When he offers to share his tequila with her, all inhibitions quickly go out the window, and young Tia gets knocked up over the weekend anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;There will be more things that happen this weekend that are going to be a secret. I promise you that.&quot; My uncle&#39;s tone sounded a deep and husky. I told myself it must be the alcohol, but something in my gut told me he was coming on to me. At this realization, instead of being freaked out, I was more turned on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Like what?&quot; I pressed, looking him in the eye and licking my lips. I swayed a little from the alcohol, but I was feeling free and invincible. Not to mention, horny as hell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Like this.&quot; My uncle stepped closer to me, wrapping one arm around my waist and using his other hand to tilt my face up to meet his. He kissed me, his lips pressing against mine forcefully. He completely possessed my mouth, forcing his tongue inside and groping my breasts as he made out with me." />
