      <meta name="description" content="Althea has been found. The missing body of the succubus has been located in a hospital. Now Rachel and her family are in a race against both time and terrifying evil, because one of the Demon-spawn also knows where her body lies. Time is of the essence, and nothing is certain.

~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
They gathered in the spare room on the ground floor. Some standing, some sitting, some leaning uncomfortably against the walls. In the middle of the room, Althea&#39;s nude body lay on a low wooden platform, no more than waist high, cushioned by a down comforter. Her head was propped up by a pair of pillows, reminding Yasna uncomfortably of funerals she had attended. In defiance of her morbid thoughts, Althea&#39;s golden skin seemed to glow in the dim light.
To Yasna&#39;s eyes, she no longer looked like she was sleeping. Instead, it seemed that she was waiting.
Rachel cleared her throat, bringing their attention to her. “It&#39;s time. What we do here tonight may make you uncomfortable. Althea and I do not ask that you take part if you are unwilling.” She took a deep breath. “Thanks to our efforts, Althea has regained much of her power. It should be sufficient to allow her to move back to her body. But she has been away from it for some time. Longer than she ever has before.
“We must remind her body of the joy to be found in life. Make it again the willing vessel of her spirit. Also, the transfer is going to take an incredible amount of power. To help cushion the drain, Althea has asked me to...to...”
She closed her eyes, speaking as if she couldn&#39;t believe what she was saying. “We&#39;re going to have ourselves a little fun in here, and if anyone laughs at me, so help me God I will punch you right in the face!”
“Fun?” Sarah asked weakly. Beside her, Jeremy swallowed, his larynx bobbing jerkily.
“Yes. I need you, all of you, to give me pleasure. Me, and Althea.&quot;" />
