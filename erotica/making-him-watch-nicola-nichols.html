  <title>Making Him Watch - Nicola Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Freddy&amp;#39;s elegance and obvious desire to please me swept me off my feet. After we married, I realized he was too nice. I like sex rough and varied. He isn&amp;#39;t jealous; it excites him to see me flirt, turn other guys on. That&amp;#39;s how I got the idea that making him watch a hot stud or two banging me would give him some serious inspiration and be fun for me, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You should move in with me,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Really?&amp;quot; The idea of getting out of my crappy apartment and living in this lovely house was incredible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;d have to quit work. That would be a bad combo. But I want to take care of you,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I want to see you happy.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And I&amp;#39;d do what?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;d be my lovely girlfriend. You&amp;#39;d be here for me. You could take classes or something. I&amp;#39;d give you an allowance so you had spending money.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who could argue with that? Not me. I agreed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He took me shopping for clothes. &amp;quot;You always look good,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;but now that you are mine, I want you to look more than nice when we went out. I want you to be incredibly desirable. Whether it&amp;#39;s a social event or business, I want you to be the sexiest, hottest woman there,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I want people to notice you the moment we walk in the door; I want men and women to see you with me and be jealous of me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was delighted to oblige. Freddy seemed to be the opposite of a jealous man. He had the money to hire people to dress me the way he wanted, and I loved the hot girlfriend vibe. Of course, that meant that I got more than my fair share of lusty looks. But Freddy loved that. He encouraged me to dance with other men, while he watched. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be shy,&amp;quot; he told me. &amp;quot;If you like a guy, let him know.&amp;quot; That surprised me, but he seemed to mean it. Again, jealousy wasn&amp;#39;t his thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You won&amp;#39;t get angry?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not as long as you are going home with me,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;You can be nice to them; I like seeing how you excite them.&amp;quot; He put an arm around my waist. &amp;quot;But then I take you to my bed.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cautiously, I tested the waters and found out he meant what he said. In fact, when I flirted with other men, it turned him on big time. In his limo on the way home, he&amp;#39;d ask me what attracted me about a guy I&amp;#39;d danced with, what about the guy excited me. While it made me feel awkward, I learned to be honest. The reward was a great night of sex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The dark-haired guy had a way of touching me that got me going,&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;d say. Or, &amp;quot;the guy with the crewcut seemed like he&amp;#39;d do whatever he wanted to a girl once he got her alone.&amp;quot;" />
