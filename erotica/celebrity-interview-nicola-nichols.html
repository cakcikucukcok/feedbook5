  <title>Celebrity Interview - Nicola Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Erotica author Lacey is invited to interview celebrity heart throb Jeff Warner at one of his notorious parties. She is supposed to talk to him about his interest in making porn movies. But the movie he wants to make is from one of her books. All she has to do is help convince his investors, who are interested in a demonstration of whether the gangbang in the book is realistic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The limo scrunched up a long gravel driveway that was dwarfed by tall and evenly spaced juniper trees. In back, Janice fidgeted in the soft leather seat, staring out the window. She was a limo virgin, she thought with amusement. It might be her first time riding in a limo, but she hoped it wouldn&amp;#39;t be her last. The decadence of being driven in this luxury car thrilled her. Best of all the limo was taking her to a party at his mansion&amp;nbsp; Jeff Warner&amp;#39;s mansion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The invitation, the offer to interview a movie star who never gave interviews, was the stuff of fantasy&amp;nbsp; hers, at least. Of course, she reminded herself, he hadn&amp;#39;t invited Janice&amp;nbsp; he&amp;#39;d invited Lacey James, author of the erotic historical novel BARBARIANS AT THE GATE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fact that she was also Lacey James, that it was her pen name, somehow made it even more weird. But it wasn&amp;#39;t. It was just publishing. She needed to shift her mindset and remember that she was the author of a long list of smutty books. She needed to do that at least through this important weekend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That Jeff Warner, the current box office heartthrob, had even read her book was amazing all by itself. Yet, according to his rather rude assistant, he had. Based on the dismal early sales she had trouble believing anyone had read it. Sure, her agent had sent it to him, but he&amp;#39;d been on a campaign of sending it to lots of famous people, hoping one of them would make some innocuous comment they could use in promotion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Apparently, Jeff not only read the book, but liked it. He&amp;#39;d told his assistant to invite her to his party.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A certain amount of her excitement involved a palpable sense of relief she felt at this event happening. This party and the interview could and should improve her book salesit would get the damn thing noticed. Her new publisher had gambled a lot on the book, spending money on a great cover shoot with sexy models and doing advertising. But the timing had sucked, with the book coming out right when too many other major events competed for the attention of a fickle public. Panicked, her agent had started his own campaign, sending out books that were paid for out of her advance. When she looked at the list, she saw Warner&amp;#39;s name.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You are sending my book to a movie star?&amp;quot; The idea of Jeff Warner reading the sex scenes she wrote was almost unbearably hot, but she couldn&amp;#39;t see him giving it an endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I heard a rumor that he&amp;#39;s interested in getting involved with erotic films,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;If there&amp;#39;s any truth in that, this could be a great connection. And I&amp;#39;m playing an angle here. I&amp;#39;ve suggested you interview him.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;He never gives interviews.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No, he doesn&amp;#39;t, but he and his people are savvy about marketing. He&amp;#39;d appreciate the idea of having an erotic writer interview him about his interest in producing porn films. Even if it isn&amp;#39;t true, he&amp;#39;d get a lot of mileage talking to you just so he can deny it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And what do I do with this interview if I get it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I talked to Connie at Connie&amp;#39;s Hot Films blog and she said she&amp;#39;ll plug the crap out of your book if you can get an interview with him. Even a shitty interview with Warner will boost sales.&amp;quot;" />
