      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sexy category romance from Entangled&#39;s Brazen imprint...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Her mind rejects his world. But her body knows its master.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Journalist Caroline Preston arrives at Serve, New York City&#39;s hottest BDSM club, with one goal--to hate it. If her brother wasn&#39;t trying to turn the family&#39;s respectable financial magazine into a publication that features &quot;lifestyle&quot; pieces for the wealthy and adventurous, she wouldn&#39;t even be there, trying to write an article about a world she doesn&#39;t understand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then she sees &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonah Briggs doesn&#39;t leave his post for just anyone. As the owner of the club, his sole purpose is to ensure that his clientele get everything they need, but when he sees Caroline, his only thought is what &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; wants--to dominate the sexy little reporter and give the most exquisite pleasure she&#39;s ever experienced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caroline has no intention of entering that particular lion&#39;s den--not with her family&#39;s reputation at stake--no matter how dark, sexy, and &lt;i&gt;complex&lt;/i&gt; the lion in question may be. But with every encounter, she craves more, and with every slide of his lips, she realizes Jonah might just be the man to break down all her defenses...if she&#39;ll let him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
