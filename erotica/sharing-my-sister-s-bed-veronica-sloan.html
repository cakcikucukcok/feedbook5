  <title>Sharing My Sister’s Bed - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
Years ago, Jeremy and Alice committed the ultimate taboo. After being forced to share a bed during a family reunion, brother and sister crossed the line from siblings to lovers. Swept up in a sexual fever hotter than either had ever felt before, they struggled to keep their relationship a secret. Now Alice is married and Jeremy is an award-winning author, but their feelings for each other haven&#39;t faded. Will they rekindle their forbidden romance?
EXCERPT
As I masturbated over the side of my sister&#39;s bed, I felt her heart beating through her breasts. &quot;How many months?&quot; she whispered.
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; I whispered back. My balls kept rubbing against the top of my boxers - an oddly pleasant sensation. The cold air gave it a strange contrast. &quot;It really is freezing in here.&quot;
&quot;How many months?&quot; my sister demanded.
&quot;Seven!&quot; I hissed. I wasn&#39;t used to having a dialogue while beating my meat. &quot;The last girl I hooked up with was a friend of a friend, at Emerson.&quot;
&quot;Was she pretty?&quot; As I stroked myself, Alice gently stroked my arm.
&quot;She had really nice legs,&quot; I said, thinking back to the way Michelle had wrapped them around me. &quot;I always noticed them because she wore skirts, even in autumn. She knew what her assets were.&quot;
&quot;Mm,&quot; said Alice. &quot;Are you a leg man?&quot;
I wanted to cum and be done with this whole strange episode, but it was like the cum was pinned to the bottom of my balls. I sped up my strokes but I remained as intractable as a stone.
&quot;This is taking longer than five minutes,&quot; she teased.
&quot;Performance anxiety,&quot; I said. 
Alice pulled away, and I heard the sheets shift behind me. I actually thought she was giving me some space to finish up, but no. After the sound of slipping fabric she returned, and this time I felt her bare nipples graze my back. &quot;Whoa!&quot; I yelped.
&quot;Shhh.&quot; Allie&#39;s fingertips slid up the back of my neck. That was heaven itself. I groaned appreciatively. &quot;Is that better?&quot; she whispered. She softly rolled her breasts into my skin. &quot;Do you like that?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; I groaned, slowing down to lengthen my strokes.
&quot;What else can I do?&quot;
&quot;You&#39;re already doing too much.&quot;
&quot;Just enjoy it.&quot; The fingers in my hair slid down my spine and creeped, slowly, over my hip. Her palm rested at my waist, perilously close to my dogged masturbation. She planted a soft, slow kiss on my shoulder. Her fingers tightened on my hip and it sent a spasm arcing down my lower back. She kissed me on the neck - it was wrong, but it felt so good! 
I felt her lips smile into my shoulder. Another kiss, another caress of my neck. &quot;Do you last this long during sex?&quot; she asked. 
&quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening right now,&quot; I said. &quot;Maybe you should just let me go-&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;Turn around.&quot;
&quot;Allie-&quot;
&quot;Do what I say.&quot;
I was so turned on from her touches that I just obeyed. Alice lifted up the sheet and then we were facing each other, she naked from the waist up and me practically naked everywhere. My boxers were tangled at my knees and she still had her panties on, but that was all, and she gazed up at me shyly to see what I thought of that. 
I thought her breasts were painfully well made. They were more than a handful each, exquisitely shaped, and gently sloped towards the mattress while she lay on her side. Her areolas were pink and pebbled and nearly the size of a half dollar, and even in the dark room her nipples were visibly erect.
