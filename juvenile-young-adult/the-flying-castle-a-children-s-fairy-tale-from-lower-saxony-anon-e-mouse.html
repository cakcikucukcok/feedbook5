  <title>THE FLYING CASTLE - A Children’s Fairy Tale from Lower Saxony - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 266&lt;br /&gt;
In this 266th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the story of &amp;ldquo;THE FLYING CASTLE&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; a Legend of Lower Saxony.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In THE FLYING CASTLE we are told of an evil woman, some may say a witch, which lived by herself in a large, dark and foreboding castle.&lt;br /&gt;
She terrorised people in the surrounding villages casting spells and stealing their livestock. Then things got worse and she started kidnapping maidens from the streets surrounding her castle. Those who were taken were never seen again.&lt;br /&gt;
The villagers combined in a show of force whent to challenge her, but before they could get too close a mighty wind and a clap of thunder stopped them in their tracks. The evil witch gave a warning not to try and break into her castle again. And with that the castle was torn from its deep foundations and lifted up into the air rising higher and higher and settled atop a nearby peak well away from the villages.&lt;br /&gt;
But our story doesn&amp;rsquo;t end here. In one of the villages, a young pious girl, a shepherdess grew up. He parents warned not to go near the castle for fear of kidnap. But being a shepherdess and having seen off wolves and other wild animals, she was not afraid.&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next? Did the witch kidnap any more maidens? More importantly, did she try and capture Antonia and did the evil withch eventually get her comeuppance?&lt;br /&gt;
Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to download and read this story to find out if the witch and her castle are still there, atop their mountain in the Haast range?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
