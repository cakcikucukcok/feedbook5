  <title>A Different Kind of Safari eBook - Helen C Hipp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What do you need to feel happy about being different? Based loosely on real life experiences, this heartwarming and powerful book illustrates how self-awareness, and courage help a young boy named Raymond learn the difference between seeing things as they appear to be and seeing things as they are. Feeling &amp;ldquo;different and lonely&amp;rdquo; Raymond befriends a hippo while on Safari in Africa. Unlike other grey hippos, this hippo is pink. Ray is soon carried into a world beyond labels and challenging assumptions. You will never guess what happens next!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Inspired by real-life adventure, the story behind the story unfolded when I went on an African safari back in 2001. The trip was lead by my father whose dream was to share the safari experience with his family. Little did I know that this trip was going to incite me to write a children&amp;rsquo;s adventure book but it did.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Revealing that life has a way of offering opportunities and nature has a way of expressing them The storyline made it appearance when my family spotted a pod of hippos and one was pink! My son Ray fourteen at the time immediately named her &amp;ldquo;Rosie&amp;rdquo;. Curious and wanting to learn more about this hippo we asked the guide many questions about hippos and hippo behavior. Specifically I wanted to know why the pink hippo stood so far outside of her pod. The familiarity of the guides answer took me by surprise, he explained that &amp;ldquo;Rosie&amp;rdquo; was tolerated but not necessarily accepted by the herd because of her differences. As a parent of a child with special needs I immediately felt a strong affiliation with Rosie&amp;rsquo;s situation as did my son Ray who has experienced his own challenges with acceptance. Inspired, I decided to share the story with the world by weaving them into a children&amp;rsquo;s adventure book that celebrates differences. The book is entitled &amp;ldquo;A Different Kind of Safari&amp;rdquo;. Find out what you can learn from Rosie the pink hippo, and how you can share those lessons with the children in your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
