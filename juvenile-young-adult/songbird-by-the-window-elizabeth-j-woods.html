  <title>Songbird by the Window - Elizabeth J. Woods</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a creative tool to spark interest in children to learn sign language, develop acts of kindness, and learn positive ways to deal with problems.
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted a dog? Kiley loves animals. She wants a dog most of all. The landlord won&#39;t allow them to have even a goldfish in their house.
&lt;p&gt;Lolo, a neighbor who befriends Kiley and her baby sister, Erica, has lots of animals. Lolo always has something new to show or teach Kiley and Erica. But what Lolo tells Kiley this time is something that could help her for the rest of her life. Will it help Kiley through her sadness while her mom is in the hospital?
&lt;p&gt;Kiley overhears the baby sitter whispering that there could be some kind of spooky spell that bad stuff keeps happening in the neighborhood. Kiley&#39;s mom is not accepting any visitors. Kiley stresses over why and what else is going on in the neighborhood. Only a howling dog can break her sleepless night into Peppermint ice cream and more questions. Will the landlord find the howling dog? When will her mom be home again?" />
