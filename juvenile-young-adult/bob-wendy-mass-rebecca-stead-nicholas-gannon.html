  <title>Bob - Wendy Mass, Rebecca Stead, Nicholas Gannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been five years since Livy and her family have visited Livy&#39;s grandmother in Australia. Now that she&#39;s back, Livy has the feeling she&#39;s forgotten something really, really important about Gran&#39;s house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out she&#39;s right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob, a short, greenish creature dressed in a chicken suit, didn&#39;t forget Livy, or her promise. He&#39;s been waiting five years for her to come back, hiding in a closet like she told him to. He can&#39;t remember who--or what--he is, where he came from, or if he even has a family. But five years ago Livy promised she would help him find his way back home. Now it&#39;s time to keep that promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clue by clue, Livy and Bob will unravel the mystery of where Bob comes from, and discover the kind of magic that lasts forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wendy Mass and Rebecca Stead, two masterminds of classic, middle-grade fiction come together to craft this magical story about the enduring power of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This title has Common Core connections.&lt;/p&gt;" />
