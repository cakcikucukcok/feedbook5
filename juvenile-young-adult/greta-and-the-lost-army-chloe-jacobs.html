  <title>Greta and the Lost Army - Chloe Jacobs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A fate as unavoidable as love itself...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending the last four years trapped in a place of monsters, demons, and magick, the last thing the fierce teenage bounty hunter Greta expected was to ever be back on Earth. But a rare opportunity gives her and the Goblin King Isaac the opportunity to do just that. Now she&#39;s home. With a boy in tow. And her parents have lots of questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Greta finally has her heart&#39;s deepest wish--to see her family again--every step she takes to reconnect with them drives her further away from Isaac. Greta and Isaac planned for her to return to Mylena and become his queen, but she&#39;s not sure if she can go back to that harsh world, though staying on Earth means giving up the boy she loves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a powerful enemy refuses to let Greta escape. A demon who will stop at nothing to destroy her and everything she loves. Even if it means following her to Earth and forcing her to face a fate as unavoidable as love itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
