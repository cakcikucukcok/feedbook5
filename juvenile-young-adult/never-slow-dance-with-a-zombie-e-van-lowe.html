  <title>Never Slow Dance with a Zombie - E. Van Lowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Romy and Michelle&#39;s High School Reunion&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Night of the Living Dead&lt;/i&gt; in this laugh-out-loud debut YA novel by Emmy Award-nominated TV writer E. Van Lowe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Principal Taft&#39;s 3 Simple Rules for Surviving a Zombie Uprising:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rule #1: While in the halls, walk slowly and wear a vacant expression on your face. Zombies won&#39;t attack other zombies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rule #2: Never travel alone. Move in packs. Follow the crowd. Zombies detest blatant displays of individuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rule #3: If a zombie should attack, do not run. Instead, throw raw steak at to him. Zombies love raw meat. This display of kindness will go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the night of her middle school graduation, Margot Jean Johnson wrote a high school manifesto detailing her goals for what she was sure would be a most excellent high school career. She and her best friend, Sybil, would be popular and, most important, have boyfriends. Three years later, they haven&#39;t accomplished a thing! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Margot and Sybil arrive at school one day to find that most of the student body has been turned into flesh-eating zombies. When kooky Principal Taft asks the girls to coexist with the zombies until the end of the semester, they realize that this is the perfect opportunity to live out their high school dreams. All they have to do is stay alive....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An unabashedly silly send-up of paranormal romance novels.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Strange Horizons&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
