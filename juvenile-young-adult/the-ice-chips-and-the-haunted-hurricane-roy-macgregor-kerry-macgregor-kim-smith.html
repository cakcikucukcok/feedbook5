  <title>The Ice Chips and the Haunted Hurricane - Roy Macgregor, Kerry MacGregor, Kim Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice makes . . . &lt;em&gt;a perfect storm&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ice Chips are facing a big hurdle at their hometown rink in Riverton. Their biggest rivals, the Stars, have a major advantage, with better gear and a state-of-the-art arena. Without more ice time, the Chips just can&amp;#8217;t keep up. Fortunately, the team has a secret weapon: their magical rink, which allows them to travel through time and meet their hockey heroes, who can teach the young players something new about the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas Finnigan and his teammates have been warned that time travel is dangerous, but when they decided to leap again&amp;#8212;hoping to find a way to squeeze in some extra practice&amp;#8212;they never dreamed that they would land in the middle of a hurricane! Luckily, a major save from a plucky young player gets the Chips out of some extremely troubled water, and soon they&amp;#8217;re running drills all over the Halifax Citadel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how will these exercises help their hockey playing? And who is this kid anyway? With the help of some of the city&amp;#8217;s famous spirits, the players might just make it home ready to compete&amp;#8212;and to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
