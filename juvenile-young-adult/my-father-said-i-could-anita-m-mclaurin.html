  <title>My Father Said I Could - Anita M. McLaurin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nearly every child has aspirations of what they want to be when they grow up? Fast forward their lives and almost 8 in 10 of them, as adults, aren&amp;rsquo;t working in their gifts and talents. And we see the impact. Millions of adults are squandering their talents and wasting their time in jobs they don&amp;rsquo;t love. They feel trapped and dissatisfied. But where did it start? Many times, it started in childhood. &amp;ldquo;My Father Said I Could&amp;rdquo; is about four African-American siblings that have big dreams, and how they overcome doubt, fear, and naysayers by listening to one steady, comforting voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This inspiring book, teaches children&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to handle the doubt, unbelief, and fear in others as well as in themselves&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The timeless lesson of continuing to ask, seek and knock for opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To explore their own unique gifts and talents&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To learn to accept the twists and turns that life brings while continuing to pursue their own destiny despite the many voices they hear along the way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author, coach, and speaker Anita McLaurin paints a picture of four African-American siblings who have big dreams. Their father equips them with the tools to follow their dreams, so they can experience the freedom to pursue their own path, utilize their gifts and talents, and live a life of significance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
