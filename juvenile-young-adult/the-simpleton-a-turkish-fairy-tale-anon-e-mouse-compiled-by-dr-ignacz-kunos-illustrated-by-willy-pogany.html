  <title>THE SIMPLETON - A Turkish Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by Dr. Ignacz Kunos, Illustrated by Willy Pogany</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 436&lt;br /&gt;
In this 436th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Turkish Fairy tale, &amp;ldquo;The Simpleton&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long, long time ago a poor Turkish woman had three sons and a daughter. The youngest son was somewhat simple and lay all day by the fireside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One day the two elder sons went into the fields to work, and before leaving requested their mother to cook them something to eat and send it to them by their sister.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the neighbourhood a Dew (a magical being) with three heads had erected his dwelling, and the brothers instructed their sister which way to take in order to avoid him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the dinner was ready the maiden set out to take it to her brothers, but she mistook her way and strayed into the path leading to the Dew&amp;#39;s house. She had walked but a few steps when the wife of the three-headed Dew stood before her and asked her how she came there. She chatted with the trembling girl until she had enticed her into the house, promising to hide her from her husband.&lt;br /&gt;
But the Dew with the three heads was there waiting for the maiden. As she entered the woman said that she would soon have a meal ready. &amp;quot;I will knead the dough,&amp;quot; she said, &amp;quot;but you, my daughter, must make the fire.&amp;quot; Scarcely had the girl begun to build up the fire than the Dew stole in, opened his mouth, and swallowed her just as she was.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the meantime the men were expecting their dinner; they waited and waited, but neither girl nor dinner were forthcoming. Evening fell, and when the two brothers, arriving home, learnt that their sister had set out in the fore noon, they suspected what had befallen her. She must have strayed into the Dew&amp;#39;s locality. The eldest brother, after a little reflection, resolved to go to the Dew and demand the girl.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well what happened next? Did the Dew return the girl or did something else happen. How did everything turn out in the end?&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read the story to find out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;

INCLUDES LINKS TO DOWNLOAD 8 FREE STORIES&lt;br /&gt;
