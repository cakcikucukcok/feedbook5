  <title>Fairday Morrow and the Talking Library - Jessica Haight, Stephanie Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eleven-year-old Fairday Morrow had no clue that moving from Manhattan to the small town of Ashpot, Connecticut would lead to an unsolved mystery. Her parents&amp;rsquo; dream of renovating a crumbling Victorian called the Begonia House into a bed and breakfast had seemed like treachery at the time, but Fairday found out that her new house kept secrets, and once inside its twisted front gates, anything was possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When mysterious notes start showing up warning that a librarian is in trouble and a bookworm is eating words, Fairday thinks the Begonia House has more skeletons in its closets. She notices a passage in her favorite book has been changed, and she&amp;rsquo;s certain something is dreadfully wrong. What happens to stories when their words get eaten?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Detective Mystery Squad is ready to investigate! Fairday, Lizzy, and Marcus take off on a sticky trail and tumble into Nowhere. Like Alice in Wonderland, Fairday finds herself in a world where nothing makes sense and the lines of reality are blurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three sleuths discover amazing things about themselves as they unravel more secrets within the walls of the Begonia House. Follow along with Fairday and friends as they open the next case in the DMS files to unlock the Talking Library.&lt;/p&gt;" />
