  <title>The Woodbegoods (Illustrated) - Edith Nesbit, Reginald B. Birch (Illustrator)</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;#39;&amp;quot;Children are like jam: all very well in the proper place, but you can&amp;#39;t stand them all over the shop &amp;mdash; eh, what?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These were the dreadful words of our Indian uncle. They made us feel very young and angry; and yet we could not be comforted by calling him names to ourselves, as you do when nasty grown-ups say nasty things, because he is not nasty, but quite the exact opposite when not irritated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My father said, &amp;quot;Perhaps they had better go to boarding-school.&amp;quot; And that was awful, because we know Father disapproves of boarding-schools. And he looked at us and said, &amp;quot;I am ashamed of them, sir!&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Bastable children behave so badly that their father sends them away to live in the countryside. Determined to be good in the future, they form a society, the &amp;#39;Wouldbegoods&amp;#39;, for being good in. But things don&amp;#39;t go exactly as they plan...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
English author Edith Nesbit s impressive body of work includes poems, plays, novels, and even ghost stories, however, she is best known for her beloved children s adventure stories, published under the name E. Nesbit. Among Nesbit s best-known works are The Story of the Treasure-Seekers, The Railway Children, The Wouldbegoods and Five Children and It. Nesbit s novels departed from the children s literary tradition of fantasy-worlds popularized by Lewis Carroll and Kenneth Grahame, and instead focused on the adventures to be had from real-life experiences." />
