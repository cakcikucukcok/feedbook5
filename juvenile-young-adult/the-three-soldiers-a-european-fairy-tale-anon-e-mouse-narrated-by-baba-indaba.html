  <title>THE THREE SOLDIERS - A European Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 426&lt;br /&gt;
In this 426th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the European fairy tale of &amp;quot;THE THREE SOLDIERS&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long, long time ago, a sergeant, a corporal and a private are returning home from war. One night they have made camp in a forest and have a roaring fire burning and the sergeant was on sentry duty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An old hag approaches and asks if she can warm herself by the fire. The sergeant readily agrees. In return the old hag gives him an empty purse. When he looks inside there is nothing. The sergeant thinks that this is the old hag&amp;rsquo;s one and only possession and offers to return it. The old woman is impressed with the sergeant&amp;rsquo;s empathy but says he must keep it. She also says to empty the contents of the purse into his hand. He is suspicious, but agrees to do so. When he does a number of gold coins fall into his hand. Needless to say he is astonished!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask, and where does a castle and a beautiful princess fit into this story? Well, as you would expect in these circumstances,&amp;nbsp; many things happened. To find the answers to this question, and any others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;

Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
