  <title>The Berlin Boxing Club - Robert Sharenow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sydney Taylor Award-winning novel &lt;em&gt;Berlin Boxing Club&lt;/em&gt; is loosely inspired by the true story of boxer Max Schmeling&#39;s experiences following Kristallnacht. &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; called it &quot;a masterful historical novel&quot; in a starred review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karl Stern has never thought of himself as a Jew; after all, he&#39;s never even been in a synagogue.&amp;#160;But the bullies at his school in Nazi-era Berlin don&#39;t care that Karl&#39;s family doesn&#39;t practice religion. Demoralized by their attacks&amp;#160;against a heritage he doesn&#39;t accept as his own, Karl longs to prove his worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Max Schmeling, champion boxer and German hero, makes a deal with Karl&#39;s father to give Karl boxing lessons. A skilled cartoonist, Karl has never had an interest in boxing, but now it seems like the perfect chance to reinvent himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Nazi violence against Jews escalates, Karl must take on a new role: family protector. And as Max&#39;s fame forces him to associate with Nazi elites, Karl begins to wonder where his hero&#39;s sympathies truly lie. Can Karl balance his&amp;#160;boxing dreams&amp;#160;with his obligation to keep his family out of harm&#39;s way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Includes an author&#39;s note and sources page detailing the factual inspirations behind the novel. &lt;/p&gt;" />
