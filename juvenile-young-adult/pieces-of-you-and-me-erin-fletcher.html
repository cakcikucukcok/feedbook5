  <title>Pieces of You and Me - Erin Fletcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Five years. That&#39;s how long I&#39;ve been gone. Since I left my best friend--the girl I loved--behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Five seconds. That&#39;s how long it takes to realize I am completely, utterly, screwed. Because now that I&#39;m back, my childhood crush has turned into so much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rylee has changed. We both have. And now I&#39;m drawn to her in a completely different way. To her smile. Her touch. To reliving old memories and making new ones. To the happiness she&#39;s always given me that I haven&#39;t felt since I left. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But her friends are hell-bent on keeping us apart. My dad is one drink away from destroying both of our lives, and maybe I am, too. It&#39;s only a matter of time before I have to leave again, and there&#39;s nothing I can do to stop it. I never get a choice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one choice I can make? Stay away from Rylee. Because if I don&#39;t, I&#39;ll break her heart--and mine--all over again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains references to drinking, addiction, and just the right amount of angst. You&#39;ll want to save this tortured hero, while at the same time, not want to change a single thing about him!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
