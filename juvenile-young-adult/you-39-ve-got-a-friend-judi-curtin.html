  <title>You&#39;ve Got A Friend - Judi Curtin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the third book in the Time After Time series our favourite time-travelling best friends are back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly’s dad comes home to surprise her - he has decided to move back permanently, and Molly tries to adjust to the new reality of him living in the neighbourhood, but not in her house. Molly soon realizes that her dad is lonely and a bit aimless. The girls try to give him a kitten but he says he can never have one after what happened to his kitten when he was a boy. The girls decide to go back in time to see if they can understand what happened. They meet a sensitive, timid young version of her dad. He is afraid of a bully who lives next door, and spends a lot of time with a kitten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something in the past is affecting Molly’s Dad’s relationships today, making his relationship with Molly and her new family difficult? Molly and Beth are determined to find out what and to do so they must embrace the 70s in all its glitter and glamour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world of the Bay City rollers and ABBA is waiting to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;" />
