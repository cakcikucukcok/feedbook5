  <title>The Caleb - Diann Ross Woodbury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book covers a part of Diann and Calebs lives and tackles more studies into the dangers of wizardry and witchcraft. It has new stories about Calebs adventures like in the first book of The Caleb, A Christian Dog. Some stories are ongoing. All the books of The Caleb series tie into each other with this book. Writing books is hard for me because I cannot clearly see. It is impossible to remember lost poems, so you will be getting new poems. The poem Forgiveness is in all my books. Some are new, and there are duplicated pictures of Caleb and other slogans. It is my hope that this book will bring you the much-needed scripture and teachings of the Bible, which will further your walk with Jesus. Caleb and I have learned so much about walking the talk that we teach you by writing this and the other books of the series. This book has ongoing instructions about why and how to avoid demonic happenings and attacks from Satan. Most of this book is nonfiction, but the fiction stories are just as amazing. I feel that by not attempting to write this book for the third time would be to cheat my readers of valuable information about the kingdom of God. It covers new topics left off from books 2 and 3. I pray you will enjoy this book as much as people have said they did with the first four. Lots of love and prayer have gone into the creation of all my books for you, but this one has been the hardest to write so far. The first book of the series is for adults and children. Book 2 is a high school-level Bible study. Book 3 is for college, and book 5 is your doctorate level. Book 4 is found on another source and is a colored paperback. It is different from the other books and is more for the collector of the series.
Love, 
Diann and Caleb" />
