  <title>Sam the Boston Terrier - Felicity L. Summers, Dwight Nacaytuna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FELICITY L. SUMMERS while in her mid-late teens fi rst met a Boxer her Dad had bought. Her fi rst reaction was that it was the ugliest dog she had seen. Sally was shown by her Dad, she was not one of the greatest of Boxers in the show ring. But Felicity grew to like the breed, handling other  Boxers, but her love was playing fi eld hockey in the winter and Vigoro
then later started playing cricket. Sam our fi rst Boston Terrier was a 21st birthday present from her Dad, not totally impressed getting a dog for such  an important birthday, she grew to love him. There were times in between sport that she would handle the Boxers and Boston Terriers as they aquired other Bostons and Obedience trials. Then came a period where she lived in Sydney New South Wales and then Adelaide, Sth Australia when she did not have a dog to show, she attended shows
to just watch. She had a couple of Boston Terriers from her Dad but they died sadly thus she started  looking for her foundation Boston Terrier that she could show and start her own breeding line. Thus  the kennel prefi x she wanted was Summadale, she never dreamed that she would have much success with some she had bred.
She travelled to New Zealand on holidays, visited various breeders, her Dad had offered to pay half if she found a Boston Terrier. She fi nally was led to a wonderful lady, Mrs Ella Howse her kennel prefi x was Bostonridge. So a young bitch was acquired and ever so grateful to have this
bitch she called Ani, for she was the Grand mother of one of Australia&#39;s top winning bitches named Zebby and also a great great grandmother to Batman, Zebby&#39;s son. Felicity knew New Zealand Boston Terrier Club were planning to celebrate the 100 yrs Show, her Dad helped her to take Zebby and Batman to New Zealand. Zebby won that show which is called a Speciality
Show only Bostons can enter. New Sth Wales in Australia had later in the year celebrated the event, 100 yr breed Specialty show. Batman won that show. Felicity sold overseas quite a few  Boston Terriers, her last puppy, male, went to Norway, where he helped improving the breed.
She now is a dog judge and has had the privilege of judging the breed in Texas, USA and Lucca, Italy. She still has a love for this breed which has so far been over 45 years." />
