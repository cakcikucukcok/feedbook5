  <title>Here Lies Bridget - Paige Harbison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Bridget Duke is the uncontested ruler of her school.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The meanest girl with the biggest secret insecurities. And when new girl Anna Judge arrives, things start to fall apart for Bridget: friends don&#39;t worship as attentively, teachers don&#39;t fall for her wide-eyed &quot;who me?&quot; look, expulsion looms ahead and the one boy she&#39;s always loved—Liam Ward—can barely even look at her anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When a desperate Bridget drives too fast and crashes her car, she ends up in limbo, facing everyone she&#39;s wronged and walking a few uncomfortable miles in their shoes. Now she has only one chance to make a last impression.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though she might end up dead, she has one last shot at redemption and the chance to right the wrongs she&#39;s inflicted on the people who mean the most to her. And Bridget&#39;s about to learn that, sometimes, saying you&#39;re sorry just isn&#39;t enough….&lt;/p&gt;
