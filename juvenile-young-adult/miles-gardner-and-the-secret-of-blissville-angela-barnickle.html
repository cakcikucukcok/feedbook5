  <title>Miles Gardner and the Secret of Blissville - Angela Barnickle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to the town of Blissville, the Knitted Egg Sweater and Walking Egg Cup capital of the world.  A town that managed to bypass modern change and stayed with old values.  But Blissville has a problem now  a thieving madman called the Geezer is on the prowl and its causing havoc in the town.  When Miles and his three best friends decide to help an elderly neighbor down the block with chores, the children stumble upon more than they could imagine downstairs in the basement.
They notice the Fleur-de-lis emblem is constantly with them giving guidance.  With the help of a special toy soldier and the movies of old Hollywood the children are able to transport themselves to a town called Swallowtail.  This is where they not only find adventure and new friends, but also stumble upon danger when closely encountering the Geezer.
Their time is limited in Swallowtail and they must figure out how the newly found clues can help them.  Where Byron Redplume, a close friend of the McGreeveys, is being held against his will, and how to return home to Blissville.
Miles Gardner, Argyle Turner, Dita Cooper and Birdie Flynn have no idea that they are being groomed to carry on a tradition of Master Casters  toy soldier makers.  The four must work together and fast, but most important is forever watching out for the Geezer who is always right behind them." />
