  <title>The Fruitosaurs and the Journey to the Planet Birth - Amol Ashok More</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This was a whole new place with unbelievable visuals and she was unable to understand where she was. She couldnt understand how mud can be white in color and a rainbow exist in the night, a big moon purple in colorall these were getting into her head, and she was going crazy. She was wondering whether all these are for real or if she is dreaming. She started to move toward the rice ship and suddenly, she heard a growling noise behind herGrrrrrrr. She looks behind, and her big black eyes become bigger. 
There was a huge dinosaur standing behind her. It had light green skin and dark green stripes on the body. It was staring at her with his deadly, ferocious eyes. Jenny could see its black razor-sharp teeth and the inside of the mouth was dark red in color. Frightened to the extreme, she screamed at the top of her voice, but there was no sound. Jenny lost her voice while screaming in the ship. The dinosaur roared again and moved towards her. Suddenly, another red-colored dinosaur came out and pushed her toward the river and jumped into it with her before the green dinosaur could act. The red dinosaur grabs her and moves with the water to the other side." />
