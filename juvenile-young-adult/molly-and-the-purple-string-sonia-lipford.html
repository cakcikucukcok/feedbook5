  <title>Molly and the Purple String - Sonia Lipford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Molly and the Purple String is about a little girl who didnt want to play with the toys she had in her room. After cleaning her room Molly tried to amuse herself by asking to help her mother and father. She even asked to play with her brother. She went for a walk since she had no luck at her house when she was met by her friend Jackie. The suggestion of going to the park was mentioned, and thats where they went to play until they both got hungry because it was almost time for dinner.
The purple string was found by Molly after leaving the park as the two friends were on their way home. Molly had fun with her friend at the park and with the string as they continued home, but she got even more excited about the things she could do with the purple string." />
