  <title>Naked - Stacey Trombley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The best place to hide is in a lie...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could never fit in to the life my parents demanded. By the time I was thirteen, it was too much. I ran away to New York City...and found a nightmare that lasted three years. A nightmare that began and ended with a pimp named Luis. Now I am Dirty Anna. Broken, like everything inside me has gone bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except that for the first time, I have a chance to start over. Not just with my parents but at school. Still, the rumors follow me everywhere. Down the hall. In classes. And the only hope I can see is in the wide, brightly lit smile of Jackson, the boy next door. So I lie to him. I lie to protect him from my past. I lie so that I don&#39;t have to be The Girl Who Went Bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that someone in my school knows about New York.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone knows who I really am. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it&#39;s just a matter of time before the real Anna is exposed...&lt;/p&gt;" />
