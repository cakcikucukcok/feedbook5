  <title>If Only I Could - Mae Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are three young brothers in this story and the oldest has been given the responsibility to be his mothers helper; considered the man of the house.  He and his brothers could not participate in after school and neighborhood activities.
Their mother was left alone. David, the oldest seem to substitute for the absent parent was given responsibilities to help which changed the dynamics of the family. He always seem to be on the inside looking out. With his active imagination, he could only wish he could do things.
Affirmation, communication and cooperation between the mother and children are shown in this story. Teachers and people of the village offered the same support.
Comments from a Peace Education Consultant:
I love this story because it discusses many behaviors and values that have been forgotten and/or overlooked.  I see there are affirmation, communication and cooperation between the mother and children in this family. The oldest child received additional affirmation and good communication from his teachers and neighbors." />
