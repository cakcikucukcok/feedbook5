      <meta name="description" content="Helping Children Understand Separation and Divorce
It is essential that parents and caregivers of children understand the thoughts and feeling that children may have when their parents decide to separate or divorce.  This can be a very confusing time for children and they need to know that their basic needs will be met and their relationship with both parents will continue.  Take your child/children questions and concerns seriously and listen to what they say.  During this transition, sometime sibling may become closer, argue, or physically fight.  Some maybe become emotionally distant.  Keep in mind that all children are individually different no matter what their age.  Just as adults adjust differently children adjusts differently.  In addition realize that feeling of loss and anger is typical emotions.  
These are helpful websites and children books for adults and anyone working with children.
