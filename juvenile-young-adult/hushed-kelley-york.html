  <title>Hushed - Kelley York</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eighteen-year-old Archer couldn&#39;t protect his best friend, Vivian, from what happened when they were kids. Since then, he&#39;s never stopped trying to shelter her from everything else. It doesn&#39;t matter that Vivian only uses him when skipping from one toxic relationship to another. Archer is always there, reeled in and tossed out, waiting to be noticed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Evan Bishop breezes into town with a warm smile and calming touch, and Archer can&#39;t deny his attraction to him. Evan is the only person who keeps him around without a single string attached. And the harder Archer falls for Evan, the more he sees Vivian for the manipulative hot-mess she really is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Viv has her hooks in deep, and once she finds out Archer&#39;s dark secret, she threatens to expose the truth if she doesn&#39;t get what she wants. And what she wants is for him to end his relationship with Evan...permanently.&lt;/p&gt;" />
