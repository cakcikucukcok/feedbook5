      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lulu Saad doesn&#39;t need your advice, thank you very much. She&#39;s got her three best friends and nothing can stop her from conquering the known world. Sure, for half a minute she thought she&#39;d nearly drowned a cute guy at a party, but he was totally faking it. And fine, yes, she caused a scene during Ramadan. It&#39;s all under control. Ish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except maybe this time she&#39;s done a little more damage than she realizes. And if Lulu can&#39;t find her way out of this mess soon, she&#39;ll have to do more than repair friendships, family alliances, and wet clothing. She&#39;ll have to go looking for herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Debut author Aminah Mae Safi&#39;s honest and smart novel is about how easy it can be to hurt those around you even if --especially if--you love them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
