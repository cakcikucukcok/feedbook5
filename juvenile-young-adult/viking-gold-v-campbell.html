  <title>Viking Gold - V Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Sixteen-year old Redknee never knew his father. Now his uncle is Jarl and wants Redknee to be a great Viking warrior. But Redknee is clumsy, and more interested in tracking the wild deer of the forest. When the young Viking stumbles upon a war-party making for his home, he must grow up quickly; the brutal Ragnar burns the village, taking for spoils only a mysterious book. Along with a small band of survivors, Redknee takes to the seas. Braving fearsome storms and volcanic islands, bloodthirsty foes and strange new civilizations, the Vikings soon find themselves far beyond the reckoning of their people. But why would Ragnar kill so many for a mere book? Will its tales of faraway lands and riches lead Redknee astray? Or does the book hold the key to his past ...and his future? V. Campbells&#39; debut novel is a thrilling tale of action and adventure, of love and loss, and the power of an unlikely friendship; join Redknee as he seeks out his destiny on the shores of the Promised Land&lt;/div&gt;" />
