  <title>WHY THE HONEY BADGER LOVES HONEY - A South African Children&#39;s Story - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 220&lt;br /&gt;
In this 220th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the South African tale of why the African Honey Badger, or the Ratel (Raa-til), loves honey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The life of the honey badger is not an easy one. There is a lot of competition in the South African bush for scarce food resources, especially wild honey. So when a Honey Badger finds a fresh beehive, they are apt to raid it for all its worth.&lt;br /&gt;
To this end Father Ratel has hidden his family&amp;rsquo;s stash of honey in a sack under his bed. It is brought out on occasion as a special treat for the young honey badgers to sample. But the family&amp;rsquo;s young son has sniffed out the stash and has been helping himself.&lt;br /&gt;
His father suspects something is going on as his son has a decided whiff of honey about him all the time. So he asks his son where he is getting the honey from.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His son tells him he is getting if from the Sweet Gum tree out there on the Savannah. But his father has never heard of a Sweet Gum tree, especially not one in this area of the veld (bush).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He asks his son where this tree is so that he can check it out in the morning &amp;ndash; which starts off a chain of events in which young ratel tries to recover the situation with predictable consequences.&lt;br /&gt;
But is young ratel able to outfox his wily father? Download and read the full story here to find out what the eventual outcome was.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
