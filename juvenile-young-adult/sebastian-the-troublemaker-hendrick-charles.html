  <title>Sebastian the Troublemaker - Hendrick Charles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nine-year old Sebastian lives with his wealthy parents in an affluent area of the city and attends a private school.  He enjoys board games, playing piano and mucking about in his best friend&#39;s tree house. But when the government abolishes private education, Sebastian is forced to go to a new and very different school where he just can&#39;t seem to fit in. His teacher and classmates have some peculiar ideas and are hell-bent on brainwashing his old values away and making him think like they do. He&#39;s determined not to give in, but it seems everyone around him has been indoctrinated - there&#39;s nowhere to turn. He can&#39;t just stand by and watch as the world changes around him, but the stakes are high - can one brave boy make a difference?" />
