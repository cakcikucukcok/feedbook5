      <meta name="description" content="This is the third of Andrew Lang&amp;#39;s the Fairy Books of Many Colours. The stories in all the books are borrowed from many countries; some are However much these nations differ about trifles, they all agree in liking fairy tales.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find 42 illustrated fairy tales drawn from France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Scotland, England, and China. You will find stories like: The Story of Caliph Stork, The Enchanted Watch, Rosanella, Sylvain and Jocosa, Fairy Gifts, Prince Narcissus and the Princess Potentilla, The Three Little Pigs, A Heart of Ice, The Three Bears, The Enchanted Ring, The Magic Swan, The Story of a Clever Tailor and many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This book contains many references to fairies. As to whether there are really any fairies or not, is a difficult question.&amp;nbsp; Andrew Lang never saw any himself, but he knew several people who have seen them-in the Highlands - and heard their music.&amp;nbsp; So, if ever you are near Nether Lochaber, go to the Fairy Hill, and you may hear the music your-self, but you must go on a fine day&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;" />
