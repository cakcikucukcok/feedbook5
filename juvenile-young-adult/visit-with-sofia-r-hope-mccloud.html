  <title>Visit with Sofia - R. Hope McCloud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What a colorful, pleasant, experience it is to page through this beautiful book. Here is a fresh way to help children talk about their thoughts and feelings. Pastor Jim Kok, Minister of Care and Kindness, at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California&lt;p&gt;
I liked reading this book. Its so cute. I think when a parent reads this book to their kids they will get to know them better by listening to the answer they will get. Laura and her dog Alley&lt;p&gt;
Heartwarming. An insightful story reflecting the depth of the human animal bond. This is an inspiration for all of us going through the highs and lows of life. Children (and their parents) learn how being touched by love enriches our life and that we are all better people for it. Rene Brewer, D.V.M. C.V.A.&lt;p&gt;
Brilliant, I love the way the author uses sweet Sofia to help people of all ages to cope.
Brenda Bass, pet owner and Welcome Waggn owner.&lt;p&gt;
This book is about the hope and adventure that comes from overcoming loss or change. Sofia is an adorable Beagle who helps her mom rise above the pain from a sudden relationship breakup and the urgency to move from her family home. Sofia and her story symbolize anyone suffering from a loss. Children and pets do not have a choice over a breakup, the death of a loved one or a sudden move. However, we can help them heal by showing them love and learning how to really listen to them even when we also feel the hurt from the pain of loss. The questions in this book are designed to create opportunities for the reader to share their thoughts and answers, with someone they trust, in a safe and loving place. The listener simply needs to respond to the answers with a polite thank you. Please read this story in a quiet place without interruptions, distractions or judgment. There is no right or wrong
answer. Thoughtful answers come from a persons loving and kind heart. When someone with a caring heart hears
the answers, the other person can heal. Listening with an open heart is a healing gift of unconditional love and the way to a pawsitive life." />
