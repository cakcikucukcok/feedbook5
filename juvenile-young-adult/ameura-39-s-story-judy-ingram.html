  <title>Ameura&#39;s Story - Judy Ingram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ameura, a high school senior who is insecure, a little over weight and still a virgin, cannot believe that the king of popularity, Vincent Valmont, wants to date her. She is leary of his invitation, but accepts it with her guard up. Vincent on the other hand,  had been praying for a girl with the special qualities Ameura doesnt realize she has. It is not long before they fall in love and begin making plans for the future. But when Vincent is killed by a drunk driver on prom night, Ameuras life begins spiraling downward into the depths of despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ameura is hurled into a severe depression, and her doctor prescribes pills to alleviate  her pain. Desperate to escape her grief, Ameura accepts a friends offer to try methamphetamine; it isnt long before she finds herself selling her body on the street to fuel her addiction. Unknowingly she becomes addicted to them, wanting more and more. But when she accidentally overdoses, and collapses on the nasty bathroom floor of a gas  station, Ameura is forced to face the deadly consequences of her choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ameuras Story, How she chose Life over Death is a poignant , inspiring tale of a teenagers struggle with addiction as she is led on an incredible journey through loss, heartbreak, and forgiveness as she ultimately witnesses Gods love in the most miraculous of ways.&lt;/p&gt;" />
