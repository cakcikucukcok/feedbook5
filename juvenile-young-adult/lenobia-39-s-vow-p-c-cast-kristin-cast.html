  <title>Lenobia&#39;s Vow - P. C. Cast, Kristin Cast</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A great journey...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A new love....&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A dark secret revealed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evreux, France, 1788:&lt;/b&gt; Before she is Zoey&#39;s favorite professor and the House of Night&#39;s powerful horse mistress... Lenobia is just a normal 16-year-old girl - with enough problems to last a lifetime. As the illegitimate daughter of a powerful baron, she has never quite belonged, and instead has to watch her spoiled half-sister, Cecile, get anything she wants. As if that&#39;s not enough, her remarkable beauty draws unwanted attention wherever she goes. For once, she would like to just fit in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when fate intervenes, Lenobia suddenly finds herself surrounded by other girls, on a ship bound for New Orleans, where they will be married off to the city&#39;s richest Frenchmen. And they&#39;re not alone.... An evil bishop who is skilled in Dark magic makes the same journey. His appetite for lovely young women makes him dangerous - most of all to Lenobia, who caught his eye back in France. So she remains hidden, making secret visits to the ship&#39;s stables, where a handsome young man and his beautiful Percheron horses soon capture her attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will they make it to land before the bishop discovers her true identity and a powerful evil breaks loose? And will Lenobia follow her heart, even if it puts lives at risk? Find out more about one of your favorite professors in &lt;i&gt;Lenobia&#39;s Vow&lt;/i&gt;, the next heart-thumping House of Night Novella by PC Cast and Kristin Cast.&lt;/p&gt;" />
