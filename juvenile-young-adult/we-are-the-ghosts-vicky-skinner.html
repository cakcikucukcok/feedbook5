      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;After her estranged brother suddenly dies, a girl embarks on a road trip to rediscover who her brother really was in Vicky Skinner&#39;s contemporary YA novel, &lt;i&gt;We Are the Ghosts&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ellie&#39;s estranged brother, Luke, dies in a car accident, she&#39;s not sure whether to be devastated that she lost the person who was once her best friend or enraged, still, that he left without a word a year ago. Now, the only people who seem to understand what she&#39;s going through are Luke&#39;s best friend and his ex-girlfriend, who she bonds with over their desire to figure out where Luke went when he walked out of their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she gets closer to them, and closer to Cade, a boy who seems determined to get to know her better, she realizes that she&#39;s not the only one with reasons to be angry at Luke. And when Ellie makes a discovery that changes everything, she and her new friends hit the road, hoping that following Luke&#39;s trail will bring them answers about the life Luke was living away from them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
