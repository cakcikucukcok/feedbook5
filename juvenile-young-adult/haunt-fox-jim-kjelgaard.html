  <title>Haunt Fox - Jim Kjelgaard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of a red fox, of a boy and a dog who hunted him, and of the wilderness where it happened. Because of the odd-shaped white patch on his chest that gave him his name, and the freak six toes on his front feet, Star was a marked fox from his youngest days. And because of his growing wisdom and cunning in escaping traps and dogs, he also became known as a &amp;#39;haunt&amp;#39; fox - an elusive prize eagerly sought by every hunter in the valley. Evading pursuit was a game Star enjoyed as much as did the hounds that trailed him. Young Jack Crowley and his foxhound, Thunder, were the youngest hunters on the &amp;#39;haunt&amp;#39; fox&amp;#39;s trail. The climax of their long chase makes a surprising ending to one of the best wild animal stories Jim Kjelgaard ever wrote." />

Haunt Fox is my favorite, mainly because I am so interested in red foxes. If you are familiar with Mr. Kjelgaard's work, this book will be about what you expect it to be- a solid, interesting story about a boy and his fascination with a legendary fox.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Haunt Fox - Jim Kjelgaard</a> </h3></p><hr/>
