  <title>Merrileggs of Macon County - Raven Joye Raye Feaster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Suddenly, out of the woods from the top of the mountain, came the pony. She was in a full gallop! Galloping so hard she looked like a runaway bulldozer coming through the woods, mowing down everything in front of her. PONY, I am over here! Grace screamed. The pony made a hard right turn and headed for the larger dog that had Grace penned to the tree. The big dog turned to confront the pony that was galloping towards him. The pony lowered her head and pinned her ears. The dogs could see she meant business. The ponys eyes were full of fury at these dogs that were trying to hurt her friend. She stopped in front of the large dog and reached out with her hoof, and took a swat at the big dogs head, but missed. She penned her ears again and reared up on her back legs, then came down striking the dog on his back. The dog yelped in pain as it rolled on the ground. The smaller dogs ran to the side of the pony and grabbed her front legs with their teeth. The pony reared up again and dislodged both the dogs grip and they fell back to the ground. The pony turned around to one of the smaller dogs and kicked it into a tree. It hit the tree and fell to the ground, and took off running, screaming in pain. The other dogs knew they didnt have a chance and turned away from the pony and ran as fast as they could behind the small dog. The large dog looked over his shoulder making sure this monster was not chasing him. They ran away howling, following a creek bed until their howl vanished in the forest." />
