  <title>Harold the Snowman - Cliff Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From all appearances, Harold the Snowman looks just right.  He has coal for a mouth, the customary pipe, a cozy scarf, and he stands tall at just the right height. But if you look closer, you&#39;ll see that Harold is shivering from the cold wind coming off the snow. You may even notice rivers of tears streaming from poor Harold&#39;s eyes. Harold is scared-but why? Can a snowman really be afraid of - snow?  An incredible thing happens to Harold, something that makes him stop crying. A friend is just what Harold needs, and there&#39;s no better friend to a snowman in need than jolly old Saint Nick.    Santa spies the sad snowman from way high above, quickly diverts his trip, and lands his sleigh next to Harold.  As Harold catches his breath, dear old Santa Clause tells Harold something important. Harold may not be afraid of the snow after all. There may be something very important that can warm Harold&#39;s frightened heart.  Can you guess what it is?" />
