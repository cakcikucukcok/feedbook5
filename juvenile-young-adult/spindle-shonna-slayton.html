      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In a world where fairies lurk and curses linger, love can bleed like the prick of a finger&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Briar Rose knows her life will never be a fairy tale. She&#39;s raising her siblings on her own, her wages at the spinning mill have been cut, and the boy she thought she had a future with has eyes for someone else. Most days it feels like her best friend, Henry Prince, is the only one in her corner...though with his endless flirty jokes, how can she ever take him seriously?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a mysterious peddler offers her a &quot;magic&quot; spindle that could make her more money, sneaking it into the mill seems worth the risk. But then one by one, her fellow spinner girls come down with the mysterious sleeping sickness...and Briar&#39;s not immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Briar wants to save the girls--and herself--she&#39;ll have to start believing in fairy tales...and in the power of a prince&#39;s kiss.&lt;/p&gt;" />
