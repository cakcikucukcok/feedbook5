  <title>Grandpa&#39;s Magic Hair - Irene Heaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The idea for this story came about when my daughter was young. We were visiting family in Scotland, and she was very curious about the wig worn by my father-in-law.
We called it Grandpas magic hair as he only wore it when he was going out. Many years later, I decided to develop the idea into a picture book for young children.
The illustrations give clues as to what is about to happen in each situation, and the repetition allows children to become more involved with the story.
The underlying message in the book is about showing kindness and helping one another." />
