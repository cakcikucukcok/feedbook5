  <title>THE CAPTAIN&#39;S EXPLOITS - An adventure of daring and wits - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 388&lt;br /&gt;
In this 388th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE CAPTAIN&amp;rsquo;S EXPLOIT&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
Long ago and far, far away in Serbia, a Captain of the Police was posted to a village. He noted the ruins of a castle atop a hill.&amp;nbsp; He makes enquiries and when exploring the ruins he finds a statue amidst the rubbish, and hears terrible stories about it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He finds several curious documents in the archives of relating to the old castle and the statue which tell of a fortune to be found. What the documents don&amp;rsquo;t tell is what happens to fortune seekers if they start the process but fail in their quest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Believing he won&amp;rsquo;t fail, he commences his search, but that&amp;rsquo;s when things begin to happen&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;. What happened to the Captain you ask? Well many things happened, some silly and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
