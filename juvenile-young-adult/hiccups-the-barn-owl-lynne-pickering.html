  <title>Hiccups the Barn Owl - Lynne Pickering</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHERE IS MY MOTHER? The little barn owl squawked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a story about; overcoming fear, friendship, caring, responsibility, forgiving, compassion, and being proud of who you are! It is an amusing tale about an owl chick called Hiccups who has a hiccup problem. He has unlikely foster parents; a pair of vultures. They are kind but not very helpful in teaching Hiccups how to hunt. They are different because they are scavengers and their food often makes Hiccups sick. Hiccups is reluctant to leave the nest because of his hiccups and wobbly flying. When his foster parents leave him abruptly, he realizes he is without survival skills. Good fortune comes Hiccups&#39; way, when a farmer cares for him after Hiccups crashes into a barn. Butch the dog, Smiley the cat, and the chickens are also part of the story. He is a barn owl and barn owls belong on a farm.&lt;/p&gt;" />
