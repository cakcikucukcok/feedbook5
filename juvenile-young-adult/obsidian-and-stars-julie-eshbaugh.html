All the things that once felt so uncertain to her are finally falling into place. But the same night as Kol and Mya&amp;#8217;s betrothal announcement, Mya&amp;#8217;s brother Chev reveals his plan to marry their youngest sister, Lees, to his friend Morsk. The only way to avoid this terrible turn of events, Morsk informs Mya when he corners her later, is for Mya to take Lees&amp;#8217; place and marry him herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rejecting Morsk&amp;#8217;s offer, and in an effort to protect her sister, Mya whisks Lees away to a secret island until things back home blow over. Mya soon realizes she&amp;#8217;s been followed, however. Even worse, lurking deep in the recesses of this dangerous place are rivals from Mya&amp;#8217;s past whose thirst for revenge exceeds all reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the lives of her loved ones resting on her shoulders, Mya must make a move before the enemies of her past become the undoing of her future. &lt;/p&gt;" />
