She barely has time to consider what this means, though, before she&amp;#39;s attacked by the murderous anti-magic organization Main de Lumi&amp;#232;re.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alarmed, her powerful father&amp;#8212;who has returned to Carrefour to protect Eveny&amp;#8212;takes her and her sister zandara queens, Peregrine and Chloe, to his home on mysterious Caouanne Island. But the island holds its own secrets about Eveny&amp;#39;s past&amp;#8212;and her future. Now she&amp;#39;s torn between two magical traditions&amp;#8212;and two boys: strong and silent Caleb, who&amp;#39;s pushing her away, and charismatic Bram, who seems too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Main de Lumi&amp;#232;re closing in and Carrefour&amp;#39;s defenses crumbling, Eveny, her sister queens, and the townspeople she&amp;#39;s supposed to protect are in danger. And as the revelations about her past continue to unfold, Eveny begins to realize that she might just be the only one who can save them all. She&amp;#39;ll have to fight for the people and the town she loves&amp;#8212;and for her own life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
