  <title>The Adventures of Judah, the Lion Dog - Linda Rahme, Mary Owens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a faraway land two thousand years ago, Joseph and his wife, Mary, arrive at a stable in Bethlehem, grateful for a place to stay for the night; Mary is about to have a baby. As the couple settles in, neither has any idea that a homeless puppy is hiding under a trough in the corner, watching and listening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The puppy is all alone and sad. He has no name, no owner, and no one who loves him. But in the quiet of the night, something wonderful happens. The baby Jesus is born! Anxious to see what God smells like, the puppy waits for Joseph and Mary to fall asleep and then creeps over to the manger, sniffs the baby, and silently vows to protect the child. After the puppy is discovered, Joseph and Mary name him Judah, the Lion Dog, and invite him on an inspirational adventure that includes a trip to the temple, a visit with the wise men, and a journey with Jesus to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Adventures of Judah, the Lion Dog&lt;/i&gt; tells the charming tale of a furry creature who makes it his mission to protect the Christ child and his family as he becomes a friend of Godand God becomes a friend of his.&lt;/p&gt;" />
