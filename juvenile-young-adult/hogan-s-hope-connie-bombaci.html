  <title>Hogan’S Hope - Connie Bombaci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Five-Star Readers&#39; Favorite Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Award-Winning Finalist in the 2017 Best Book Awards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endorsed by Dennis Murphy, NBC Dateline Correspondent and five-time Emmy Award winner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreword by Dr. Nicholas H. Dodman, Professor Emeritus, Animal Behaviorist, Tufts University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deaf dogs are often mistreated, abandoned, or even destroyed. Hogan&#39;s Hope is the tale of a legendary deaf canine hero who, after being rescued from severe abuse, prevailed as he learned American Sign Language and provided the hope of life, not death, for deaf dogs worldwide. His courage to overcome prejudices and myths continues to provide inspiration to anyone - human or pet - that success and genuine love are truly possible. This valiant deaf dog reveals that by choosing hope anyone&#39;s dreams can come true and the world can be filled with steadfast faith, pure joy, and unconditional love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hogan&#39;s Hope, like the book Tuesday&#39;s Promise by New York Times bestselling author, Luis Carlos Montalvan, shares the deep devotion and dedicated bond between Hogan and his human. Hogan touches the soul and encourages people to find real love and meaning in their lives despite any challenge. Similar to Hannah in Devoted, Hogan inspires readers to examine their hearts, discover the faithfulness of true and meaningful relationships, and learn from the loyalty of our four-legged heroes. And, by discovering a new world beyond the door of the metal cage, some say that he&#39;s similar to Lucy in The Chronicles of Narnia and The Little Prince searching each adventure with great anticipation. He met each new day as a wonderful adventure to learn, to accept, and to hope. His purpose in life was to love his human with indescribable adoration and to promote hope, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hogan&#39;s fame spread through television shows such as Oprah Winfrey, Jack Hanna&#39;s Animal Adventures, Dateline, Amazing Tails, National Geographic, and Good Morning America.&lt;/p&gt;" />
