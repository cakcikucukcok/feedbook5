  <title>THE MYSTERIOUS SHIN SHIRA - Magical Mystery and Adventure in Victorian London - G. E. Farrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The mysterious Shin Shira is a being from an unknown realm who is more like a man than he is a magical being. An ancestor Shin Shira had annoyed the narrator&amp;rsquo;s great grandmother, and she cast a spell on Shin Shira which would make him appear and disappear whenever the old lady chose. Unfortunately, it didn&amp;#39;t work on Shin Shira&amp;rsquo;s ancestor but hundreds of years later, it somehow works on Shin Shira.&lt;br /&gt;
Shin Shira recounts a variety of adventures and mysteries about his comings and goings, involving a dragon, a roc, a Duchess, a magic carpet, a lame duck, the disappearance of a famous diamond and other fabulous things, before he attempted to settle down as a proper Gentleman in Victorian London.&lt;br /&gt;
But just how does the spell work and why does Shin Shira keep disappearing at the most inopportune moments?&lt;br /&gt;
