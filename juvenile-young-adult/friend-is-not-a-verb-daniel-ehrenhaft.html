  <title>Friend Is Not a Verb - Daniel Ehrenhaft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know things are bad when your dreams come with a washed-up &#39;80s soundtrack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry &quot;Hen&quot; Birnbaum&#39;s sister, Sarah, missing for over a year, has come home unexpectedly, with no explanation at all. But he can&#39;t leave well enough alone; Hen needs to figure out why she disappeared, even if she won&#39;t tell him. It&#39;s not like he has anything better to do. His girlfriend just dumped him and kicked him out of their band. He can&#39;t play the bass worth crap anyway. His social life consists of night after night of VH1 marathons with his best friend and next-door neighbor, the neurotic Emma Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hen&#39;s sure the answers to Sarah&#39;s lost year lie with Gabriel Stern&amp;#8212;Sarah&#39;s friend from college who also happens to be a twenty-two-year-old fugitive from the law and Hen&#39;s bass teacher . . . too bad he can&#39;t play bass worth crap either. A month into his quest, Hen has had countless consultations with Emma, watched approximately fifty-three reruns of &lt;em&gt;Behind the Music&lt;/em&gt;, and made one new Facebook friend. Unfortunately, he&#39;s no closer to any revelations about his sister. The thing is, he&#39;s too distracted to notice it, but while Hen&#39;s been looking for all the answers, something mind-blowing happened: He got a life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
