  <title>What Would Jesus Do? - Magdalene Pagratis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A book for children, to nourish their faith and love for Jesus Christ, to keep Him alive inside their minds and hearts and to encourage their imagination to take flight. In What Would Jesus Do? Book 2 of the Jesus Series, Jonathon, the protagonist, asks the poignant question, &amp;quot;What would Jesus do?&amp;quot; and ponders all that Jesus might do in different situations. It is a sweet and beautiful book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What Would Jesus Do?, with colourful, clear images and memorable words is a wonderful medium to place Jesus in the here and now, and to keep Him relevant and contemporary. This book provides a subtle and profound teaching moment, to introduce the kindness and healing power of Jesus as well as His personal friendship with each of us. We are encouraged to think of Him, call Him and feel Him in our night dreams and day dreams, and even in books for our children, so that they too can feel Him close. Before bedtime, during the day and during playtime too." />
