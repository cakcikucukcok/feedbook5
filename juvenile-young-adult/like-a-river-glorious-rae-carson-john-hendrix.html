  <title>Like a River Glorious - Rae Carson, John Hendrix</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sequel to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8211;bestselling and National Book Award longlisted &lt;em&gt;Walk on Earth a Stranger&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her harrowing journey west to California, Lee Westfall has finally found a new home&amp;#8212;one rich in gold, thanks to her magical power, a power that seems to be changing every day. But this home is rich in other ways, too: with friends who are searching for a place to be themselves, just as she is, and with love. Jefferson&amp;#8212;her longtime best friend&amp;#8212;hasn&amp;#8217;t stopped trying to win her heart. And Lee is more and more tempted to say yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But her uncle Hiram hasn&amp;#8217;t given up his quest to get Lee and her power under his control. When she&amp;#8217;s kidnapped and taken to him, Lee sees firsthand the depths of her uncle&amp;#8217;s villainy. Yet Lee&amp;#8217;s magic is growing. Gold no longer simply sings to her, it listens. It obeys her call. Is it enough to destroy her uncle once and for all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rae Carson, acclaimed author of the Girl of Fire and Thorns series, takes us deep into the gold fields as she continues this sweeping saga of magic and history, and an unforgettable heroine who must come into her own. &lt;em&gt;Like a River Glorious&lt;/em&gt; is the second book in the Gold Seer trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
