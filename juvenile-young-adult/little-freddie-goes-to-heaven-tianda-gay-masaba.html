  <title>Little Freddie Goes to Heaven - Tianda Gay-Masaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Little Freddie had been sick a long time and through it all he remained very loving and kind to his family and friends. It is because of Freddies acts of kindness that God lets him come right on into heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Freddie is greeted and escorted in by his own personal angel, Angelica. Angelica brings Little Freddie to meet God. On the way, Little Freddie sees lots of beautiful things. He meets other angels and, from a distance, takes in a view of Gods mansion. Once in Gods mansion, Freddie is quickly embraced by his loving God. They give thanks for each other. God wants to reward Freddie for not only being a wonderful son but also for helping other sick children while he was in the hospital. So God moves back the angels, and Little Freddie gets his surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There waiting for him are some of his friends from that hospital, his grandma-ma, and his favorite uncle Billie. We are no longer sick, and there is no more pain inside, they tell Little Freddie. Shortly after, God tells Little Freddie that he can go play with his friends, be with his grandma-ma and uncle. That suits Freddie just fine, but he asks God to make one more wish come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Freddie wants Angelica to please go back and tell his mom, dad, sister, brother, and his favorite aunt, Fannie Lou, that he is healthy and happy in heaven above and that the things his mommy and daddy said of heaven are very, very true. So God sends Angelica back to deliver this message to Freddies family. And as for Little Freddie, he cries and hurts no more, he lives with God and the angels, who keep him safe forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;" />
