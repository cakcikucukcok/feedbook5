  <title>Popsicle Castle - Christine Bollen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The courage and strength that our forefathers provided made us aware of the blessings we had at the turn of the 20th century. Captain Nelson requested Lieutenant Olaf and two valiant soldiers, Melvin and Peter, to go on a mission. They were to look for an unusual creature for his collection. They left Camp Thor on horseback to find Popsicle Castle. This was a unique Viking place, but Lieutenant Olaf has a secret to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ancient times there lived creatures of great intelligence. The soldiers discovered this and more. Can you discover what they are? Have you ever felt you were saved from a situation that was difficult to explain? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soldiers learned about faith and courage. See if you can find their discoveries. This story is for children and the young-at-heart who enjoy adventure, wonder, and the suspense of fantasy and fiction. I have written other childrens stories that can be purchased on Amazon.com. It is a privilege to be a parent, grand or great-grandparent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
