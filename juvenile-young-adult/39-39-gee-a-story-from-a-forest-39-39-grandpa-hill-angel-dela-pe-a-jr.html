  <title>&#39;&#39;Gee!! a Story from a Forest&#39;&#39; - Grandpa Hill, Angel Dela Peña Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What motivated the evolution from a personal BLOG to a series of childrens books?
With every venture into the outdoors, we find some new wonder of nature, be it from the changing seasons or the change in environment. There is always something new to find, so I elected my BLOG to share the pleasures I have absorbed from my frequent wanderings.  
I have recently decided to evolve a portion of my writings into a childrens level series.  Only because I believe that children need some additional prompting into the vocabulary of science and nature and their curiosity is the key to their success.  With nominal help from teachers, mentors and especially parents, curiosity may have killed the cat, but it will certainly build the child.   I felt that these discovered wonders should be shared with the children before the wonders pass them by.  Simple but challenging reading may require some mentoring to start, but that is exactly what I meant to create.
