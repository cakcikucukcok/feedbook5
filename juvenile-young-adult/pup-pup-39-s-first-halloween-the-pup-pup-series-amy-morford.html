  <title>Pup Pup&#39;s First Halloween: The Pup Pup Series - Amy Morford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dogs are viewed as members of the family so we sometimes forget that they are different. Events and experiences that are fun and exciting to humans can seem a little spooky to dogs--especially on Halloween! Pup Pup&#39;s First Halloween is the story of an adopted puppy&#39;s first Halloween experience with his beloved adopted family. Readers of the original Pup Pup book are already familiar with the story of Pup Pup&#39;s adoption, but it&#39;s not necessary to have read the first book to enjoy this amusing Halloween tale! Everyone knows that Halloween is a fun night for humans and &quot;children&quot; of all ages to dress up in their favorite fantasy outfit. But to a newly adopted dog like Pup Pup, Halloween can be downright scary. Will Pup Pup survive his first Halloween night? Will he ever see his beloved family members again? Pup&#39;s Pup&#39;s First Halloween is filled with scary drama, but it&#39;s also an educational lesson about the way that dogs view the &quot;normal&quot; holiday rituals that humans take for granted. Pup Pup&#39;s First Halloween is a fun-filled holiday treat that&#39;s full of empathy and sympathy for Pup Pup. Best of all, there&#39;s a warm and fuzzy ending!" />
