  <title>GOBLIN FACE - An Old English Bedtime Story - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 314&lt;br /&gt;
In this 314th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;GOBLIN FACE&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, a long, long ago in old England, a mother had run out of books with bedtime stories, so she decided to tell a story from her childhood experienced during a holiday in far-off Scotland, when, just before closing her eyes she saw the face of a Goblin.&lt;br /&gt;
Did she really see a Goblin, or was it a reflection or a mirage or maybe even a refraction of the light on a window pane?&lt;br /&gt;
Well to find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
