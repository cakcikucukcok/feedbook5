  <title>Orca Chief - Robert Budd, Roy Henry Vickers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Orca Chief&lt;/I&gt; is the third in a series of Northwest Coast legends by Roy Henry Vickers and Robert Budd. Their previous collaborations, &lt;I&gt;Raven Brings the Light&lt;/I&gt; (2013) and &lt;I&gt;Cloudwalker&lt;/I&gt; (2014), are award-winning national bestsellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Thousands of years ago in the village of Kitkatla, four hunters leave home in the spring to harvest seaweed and sockeye. When they arrive at their fishing grounds, exhaustion makes them lazy and they throw their anchor overboard without care for the damage it might do to marine life or the sea floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;     &lt;p&gt;When Orca Chief discovers what the hunters have done, he sends his most powerful orca warriors to bring the men and their boat to his house. The men beg forgiveness for their ignorance and lack of respect, and Orca Chief compassionately sends them out with his pod to show them how to sustainably harvest the ocean&amp;#8217;s resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Accompanied by almost exclusively new illustrations by Roy Henry Vickers, this next installment of the Northwest Coast Legends will captivate readers young and old with its vivid imagery and remarkable storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
