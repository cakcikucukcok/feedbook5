  <title>A Day in the Life of a Pair of Trousers and Other Stories - Brian A Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Day in the Life of a Pair of Trousers and Other Stories: 48 Stories for Use in Christian Worship and on Other Occasions offers worship leaders a treasury that opens up the Scriptures to children.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storyteller, Brian A. Curtis, recognizes the deep need for churches to share biblically grounded stories with children who come to worship, especially in congregations where worship tends to cater to adults. He also acknowledges the difficulties faced in asking children, who are unfamiliar with church practices, to gather at the front of the church. As a consequence, A Day in the Life of a Pair of Trousers and Other Stories is designed to work well with children, particularly with those who wish to remain seated with their families.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories use simple, colourful, and enchanting language to tell memorable tales that bring key biblical themes and texts to life. They can be read aloud, straight from the page, to children of all ages.  Indeed, adults may well be found listening and engaged in the stories. Forty-four of the stories stand on their own. The remaining four are linked in episodic format intended to be used over consecutive worship services.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collection of forty-eight stories equips worship leaders to offer uplifting biblical messages to children, especially to those who may be unfamiliar with Christian worship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
