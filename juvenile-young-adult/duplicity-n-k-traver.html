  <title>Duplicity - N. K. Traver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A computer-hacking teen. The girl who wants to save him. And a rogue mirror reflection that might be the death of them both.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In private, seventeen-year-old Brandon hacks bank accounts just for the thrill of it. In public, he looks like any other tattooed bad boy with a fast car and devil-may-care attitude. He should know: he&#39;s worked hard to maintain that façade. With inattentive parents who move constantly from city to city, he&#39;s learned not to get tangled up in things like friends and relationships. So he&#39;ll just keep living like a machine, all gears and wires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then two things shatter his carefully-built image: Emma, the kind, stubborn girl who insists on looking beneath the surface - and the small matter of a mirror reflection that starts moving by itself. Not only does Brandon&#39;s reflection have a mind of its own, but it seems to be grooming him for something--washing the dye from his hair, yanking out his piercings, swapping his black shirts for ... &lt;i&gt;pastels&lt;/i&gt;. Then it tells him: it thinks it can live his life better, and it&#39;s preparing to trade places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when it pulls Brandon through the looking-glass, not only will he need all his ill-gotten hacking skills to escape, but he&#39;s going to have to face some hard truths about who he&#39;s become. Otherwise he&#39;ll be stuck in a digital hell until he&#39;s old and gray, and Emma and his parents won&#39;t even know he&#39;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/i&gt; lists N. K. Traver&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Duplicity&lt;/i&gt; as part of one of the great YA book trends to look for in 2015 --don&#39;t miss it!&lt;/p&gt;" />
