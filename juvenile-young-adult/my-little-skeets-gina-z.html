  <title>My Little Skeets - Gina Z</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Christian series of childrens books that I have written are filled with exciting tales of five young roller skates who each possess their own distinct personality. Also I have kept my books so simple that a young mind may not wander off or become bored before reaching the end of these incredible stories! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colorful characters that I have created find themselves in some tough situations. But through the power of Gods Holy Word and a dedicated skate, My Little Skeets learn some valuable lessons on what is right and what is wrong. The young skates encourage and uplift one another throughout their struggles. My Little Skeets series offers young readers the possibility of finding friendship with the most lovable bunch of characters they have ever known. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My prayer is that this series of books will bring laughter and joy into the hearts of boys and girls across the world. My hope is that children will find truth on the pages of my books and that they will continue to be a guiding force throughout their lifetime! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older red skate who directs and guides these little skeets is a representative of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Miss C teaches the roller skates the consequences of making bad decisions and also how our Father Who Art in Heaven wants us to behave. More important than anything else is that my stories plant a seed of love, forgiveness, grace, and mercy that come from the most high, all-powerful, and living God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
