  <title>The White Squirrels Find a Home in Pisgah Forest - P. I. Ferguson, Summer Whiteside</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mr. Day bought the white squirrels from a pet shop to entertain curious visitors at Fun Day Carnival.  Although Mr. and Mrs. Squirrel seem happy enough and do their tricks well, Mr. Day worries about them. The white squirrels are special. He wonders where they came from and where they belong. Maybe the squirrels would be happier on a farm. Mr. Day has family in western North Carolina, so he sends the white squirrels to them. Theres still something missing, though, so Mr. and Mrs. Squirrel eventually escape and must make their way in the wild. They will need to learn from other squirrels to survive the winter. There might even be a surprise come spring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real white squirrels can be seen in the wilds of Pisgah Forest in western North Carolina. They arrived in the 1950s and have been a fairly common sight ever since. Author P. I. Ferguson welcomes her wild visitors and loves when one of her many grandchildren gets a glimpse of this special and unusual animal that has found a home in the mountain forests.&lt;/p&gt;" />
