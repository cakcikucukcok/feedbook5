  <title>Four Fantastic Bedtime Stories for Children 3-5: Vol. 3 - Scott Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Four fantastic children&amp;#39;s books, all rolled into one. Perfect for bedtime! Approximately 150 pages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WHAT&amp;#39;S INCLUDED:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My Daddy&amp;#39;s Cool Car Collection&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Featuring an assortment of colorful cars, My Daddy&amp;#39;s Cool Car Collection is a fantastic story to read your son before tucking him into bed. Includes over 30 pages of dazzling cars and trucks that&amp;#39;s tied together with a heartwarming message.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Penguin Way&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Look deep inside. You have what it takes. It&amp;#39;s within you, as long as you believe in yourself and don&amp;#39;t give up. That is the penguin way. Leave your doubts at the door. You shall succeed!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If I Were A Robot&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever dreamed of being a robot? What would you do? How would you do it? And most importantly, what would you create with your newfound powers? Find out what a young boy discovers when he visits the land of dreams, and builds his own vision of the future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Taming Your Pet Monster: An Operational Guide&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The craziest user guide you&amp;#39;ll ever read! Written for mommies and daddies just as much as their children, Taming Your Pet Monster is filled with laugh-out-loud humor and bizarre situations. Witty, colorful and unique, this is one wacky ride you&amp;#39;ll never forget!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Descriptions of my other popular children&amp;#39;s books are included after the main features (an additional 5 pages)." />
