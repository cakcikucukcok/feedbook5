  <title>Better Than the Best Plan - Lauren Morrill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lauren Morrill&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Better Than the Best Plan&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh, funny, romantic YA novel about a teenage girl who finds an unexpected silver lining in her life when plans get turned upside down.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plans are made to be broken.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s the last day of junior year, and seventeen-year-old Ritzy--short for Maritza--is pretty sure she has a great plan. Summer job--check. Hang with friends at the beach--check. Keep looking after herself as she&#39;s been doing since her mom bailed to follow her bliss--check. Or no check?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After someone reports that Ritzy is living alone, a social worker shows up and puts her into foster care. That&#39;s surprise enough. Even more surprising? Ritzy has been in foster care before, as an infant, and the woman who cared for her then takes her in again. But maybe the greatest surprise of all for Ritzy is that living with her foster mother, Kristin, in Kristin&#39;s gorgeous house, isn&#39;t all that bad. And neither is the cute, friendly boy next door. If Ritzy&#39;s mom hadn&#39;t gotten her back all those years ago, this is the life she could have had. But is it the life she &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; have had?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ritzy&#39;s old life catches up with her new one, she has some decisions to make. Can she plan for the worst, but still hope for the best?&lt;/p&gt;" />
