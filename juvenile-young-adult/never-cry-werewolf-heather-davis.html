  <title>Never Cry Werewolf - Heather Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moonlight can totally change your life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it all starts so simply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You. Him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so maybe Shelby has made a few mistakes with boys lately (how was she supposed to know Wes had &quot;borrowed&quot; that Porsche?). But her stepmother &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; overreacts when she catches Shelby in a post-curfew kiss with a hot senior: Suddenly Shelby&#39;s summer plans are on the shelf, and she&#39;s being packed off to brat camp. It&#39;s good-bye, prom dress; hello, hiking boots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things start looking up, though, when Shelby meets fellow camper (and son of a rock star) Austin Bridges III. But soon she realizes there&#39;s more to Austin than crush material&amp;#8212;his family has a dark secret, and he wants Shelby&#39;s help guarding it. Shelby knows that she &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; shouldn&#39;t be getting tangled up with another bad boy . . . but who is she to turn her back on a guy in need, especially such a good-looking one? One thing&#39;s for sure: That pesky full moon is about to get her into trouble all over again. &lt;/p&gt;" />
