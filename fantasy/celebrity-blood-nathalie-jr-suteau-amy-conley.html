  <title>Celebrity Blood - Nathalie Jr. Suteau, Amy Conley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Julie is bored with her office in the French bank where she works &amp;ndash; until the day she leaves on a business trip to London and meets Milo, a young computer hacker. Over the course of that weekend, Julie finds a USB drive. Back in Paris, Julie remembers the drive she found. It turns out to be a document written by Mortimer Diggler, a well-known and respected journalist &amp;ndash; a document that accuses Stuart Shelby, a Hollywood favorite, of being a serial killer!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julie decides to spice up her boring life by playing a little game, which quickly gets out of hand. She soon finds herself in London, working for Stuart Shelby, searching for new victims for the killer star. But is he just insane, or is he really a murderer? And is there any truth to his stories about curing his bizarre anemia with the blood of his victims? And if what Shelby says is true, what does that mean... could she become Shelby&amp;#39;s prey... and what if Shelby is a sort of vampire, immortal...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Musicians call it &amp;quot;the art of counterpoint&amp;quot; - creating multiple melodies that sound simultaneously several octaves apart. In her own way, Nathalie Suteau practices this art, with all the subtlety it demands, for she is not content to share in her characters&amp;#39; joy at the brusque acceleration of their lives and in the background, she orchestrates a disturbing score. Thus, all the lives caught up in this strange plot are touched by the dark side that comes with an existence that is free from boredom and banality &amp;ndash; risk, anguish, and Death as a constant companion." />
