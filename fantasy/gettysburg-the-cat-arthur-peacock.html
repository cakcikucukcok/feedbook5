  <title>Gettysburg the Cat - Arthur Peacock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 137th New York Regiment courageously and heroically defended a key point of the Union defense during the Battle of Gettysburg on Culp&#39;s Hill. Matt McCabe, a young Union soldier, befriends a cat that instantly becomes a lucky pet for his immediate group as well as the whole regiment. The thoughts and feelings of young men in combat are explored and the battle is accurately described. The 137th received more casualties than any other regiment in the Union army. Matt McCabe survives the battle only to march away leaving his new found friend, Gettysburg the Cat, behind. Or does he?
You will learn some of the daily activities of young men in war and how they behave in battle. War is a tragic, horrible experience, yet there is a bond of friendship that exists among the troops, and there are moments of both tragedy and humor, such as you would find in a Shakespeare play. This is an entertaining novel complete with pathos, historical accuracy, a few moments of humor, and a cat." />
