  <title>Ancients of 318 - Jesse Aaron Blackbourne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hex Sortilege knows he cannot learn from the mistakes of his past if he does not know what they are. Instructed by Emperor Enoch Oberon to document the important events of his time, Hex narrates a fantasy tale like no other, describing a hidden version of Shreveport, Louisiana, populated by angelic, demonic, and lycanthropic humanoids.
After King Enoch sends Hex to investigate a young elf known to have a dark aura about her, his normally peaceful life rapidly turns into a nightmare. When he encounters the feisty elf in an underground bar, she informs him she has come to Shreveport to escape the Ancients pathetic High Council and all its rules. Unfortunately, the elf has already broken two rules, and Hex must take her by force to see the King immediately. But when she meets the King Enoch, all hell breaks loose; she unleashes her fiery temper and reveals the true reason for her presence to the Shreveport monarchy.
Everyone knows the Ancients of 318 kneel before nothingnot even their own vices. But it is only a matter of time before the King and the residents of Shreveport are unintentionally entangled in the inexhaustible drama that surrounds a manipulative elf." />
