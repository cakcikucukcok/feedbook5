  <title>The Inner Lands: Something Stirs - A J Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For centuries, the mountainous borders of the Inner Lands had kept the monstrous Grinth at bay, and people had finally found peace. But their complacency would be their undoing, for everything was about to change. As their world falls apart around them, an unlikely bond between a young girl, beaten by her father, and a conflicted warrior, haunted by his tragic past, could well seal the fate of all humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they fight for their survival, a final battle looms. But before they can stand a chance against the Grinth, they&amp;#39;ll first have to conquer their own pasts. Will friendship and strength prevail? Or will the cunning and cruelty of evil twist the world into turmoil? Nothing is certain in the Inner Lands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Fallor called a meeting for the entire Hillock village, little did Sill know that it was just the beginning in a series of events that would reshape everything she knew about their small world. The&amp;nbsp;banishing of her abusive father frees her to embark on a journey of her own. One in which she encounters incredible natural wonders like the Moonmirror Peak, mysterious people like Draneth the shaman and his hawk Tamarellin, strange men with stranger eyes; and the mighty Rydan Fort, built into the side of a mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could have been the adventure of her dreams, were it not for the monstrous creatures that pursue her all the way; bringing death, destruction and tragedy to everything and everyone she grows to cherish. The power she kept a secret for so long is too much for her young mind to handle but she&amp;#39;ll have to learn how to wield it, and quickly, if she&amp;#39;s to survive in this harsh new world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
