Half human and half vampire, they are a new race, struggling to be accepted  but who will accept them? They do not belong with the pureblooded vampires; do they instead belong with humans? This is what Angel Mackenzie must find out.
Angel is one of this new species, with the power of an immortal and the beating heart of a human. She lives in a small town where she often feels alone and different. She longs to be in love, so when she discovers her equal in the handsome Logan, she thinks she may have met the man of her dreams. When a stranger arrives in town, however, Angels feelings for Logan come into question.
The stranger is Gabrieldirect descendent of the elder vampire, Michael. He is a royala prince among them and the first of their new species. Angel cant help but feel drawn to him. There is something powerful about Gabrieland sensual. Will she stay true to her humanity with Logan or become a bloodthirsty monster with Gabriel at her side? As ancient blood battles within her, Angel must find the power to choose." />
