  <title>Between Two Wars - Robert S. Telford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is the early twentieth century, and aspiring journalist Howard Andrews has been nurturing a love affair with Eleanor Arlingtonpartly in his own imaginationsince he was fifteen years old. But when Ellie tells Howie she is dropping out of college because her father has lost their family farm, he can only hope that they will be together one day. But even as the country prepares for a seemingly inevitable world war, Howard proposes. It seems all his dreams are about to come true.
By the spring of 1917, the world has turned inside out. With a little more than three months to go before their wedding, Congress declares war, changing everything for the young couple. In a short span, Howard signs up for artillery school and seals his commitment with Eleanor during what turns out to be a beautiful, military wedding ceremony. Just two days later, he must report for duty and leave his new wife behind. Little does he know that a tiny life has already begun to grow inside Eleanor.
In this historical tale based on true events, a father and son soon discover that the consequences of warand the peace that followswill pursue both of them for much longer than they ever imagined." />
