  <title>A Wolf&#39;s Journey - Alicia Hamilton, Robin Victory Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One girl&#39;s journey to discover where she came from.   
Daceria is alone, the last of the clan of silver wolves and daughter of Ace, King of Wolves. She can hardly remember her family or past, and has lived in near solitude most of her life. But things are about to change. 
          &quot;This world I live in is full of danger no matter where I turn. &quot;         
 Daceria is half demon, hiding away deep in a forest, where she is safe. Her life is quiet and peaceful, if lonely, until a human man stumbles across her path.
           Blood ran down his face like rain falling from the midnight sky. 
 She knows one thing for sure: never trust a human. But she is drawn to him for reasons she can&#39;t explain. He is handsome and charming, but the connection they share runs deeper than words, and she finds herself falling...
            &quot;Everyone falls in love with someone, even people like you.&quot;
  Adam flies solo. He always has, and always will. That is what he tells his brother. But when he is attacked by demons, he stumbles into the home of a beautiful girl with wolf ears and a tail. Demons are evil--he has always known this, ever since the day his parents died. But Daceria challenges that belief, surprising him with her gentle ways and caution, and of course, plight--she is a rare creature, wanted by Demon Hunters who will stop at nothing to capture her. 
                 &quot;Daceria I love you.&quot;
 When a sorceress&#39;s evil spell takes Adam away from her, Daceria must find a way to save him. To do that, she must unlock the hidden secrets of her past and discover what it truly means to be Ace&#39;s legacy. She is her family&#39;s last hope; she cannot fail. But she cannot succeed alone.
Let the journey begin." />
