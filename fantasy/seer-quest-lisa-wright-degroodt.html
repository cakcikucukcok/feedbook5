  <title>Seer Quest - Lisa Wright DeGroodt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Quests continue&lt;br&gt; 
A librarian with the NYC library, Liz Keeper stumbles upon a strange book. Liz quickly realizes that she can read the mysterious language and discovers the manuscript is a primer on how to be a Seer. Soon Liz is beset with strange visions and dreams that are disconcertingly valid predictions of future events. Panicked and wary, when she researches the books legacy wheels are set in motion that bring Evil into Lizs life and chases her through the Interdimensional Void, barely escaping his clutches.&lt;p&gt; 
Once in the Land, Liz is beset from all sides by intrigue and. Uncomfortable with her new powers, Liz is not sure she wants to be intertwined with the Land permanently. Help comes from the least expected sources, as does treachery. While battling Evil at every step, Liz has to learn to rely upon herself; not the Seer, not the Protectors, not even the handsome Guardsman who becomes more than just a bodyguard. Liz must realize her true strength and power in enough time to make the right choice for herself and the Land. The fate of the dimensions lie in balance, and everything depends on Lizs decision." />
