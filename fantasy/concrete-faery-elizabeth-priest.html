  <title>Concrete Faery - Elizabeth Priest</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When it comes to fantasy, the world is always bigger than you think it is&amp;hellip; Even when you live in the smallest town in the deepest corner of the country where, by official records, nothing has happened since Vikings stopped pillaging nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ally Guardian is convinced that the universe wanting anything to do with her is a cosmic joke. Until a strange man appears outside her window and tells her, &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to you yet.&amp;rdquo; Things only get weirder when she is then implicated in a demonic attack on her history teacher and given the new girl, Alana Larbie, to look after as punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alana seems to know an awful lot about demons, claiming they got her kicked out of her old school. Together with Ally&amp;rsquo;s oldest friend Tanya, and their one &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; friend, Teb, they decide to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Troutesponde Series is a YA fantasy, working on the premise that if the supernatural did exist, inquisitive teenagers would be the first to notice, and absolutely the worst people ever to interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
