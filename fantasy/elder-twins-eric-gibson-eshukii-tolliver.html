  <title>Elder Twins - Eric Gibson, Eshukii Tolliver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twins aren&#39;t always identical.  This isn&#39;t more true, than in the lives of Danny and Danielle Elder.  In fact, they can&#39;t stand one another.
                    Tensions between the twins worsen, when the mysterious, Haveltre, is accidentally opened and the two are pulled away from their lives and into a realm of death and despair.
                    Led by their guardian, Marques, the twins must face the evil that wishes to destroy the Ezidian Realm and invade Earth.
                     Through, the Ezidian Realm they meet elves and dwarven ghosts.  Face goblins and Orcs.  They fight their way through swamps, forests, and some of the most treacherous landscapes.  All while trying, to work together.
                    The evil goblin, King Goula, will do whatever it takes to stop the Myserian Seals from being closed.  The evil King is the largest and the most ruthless of all the goblin race.  He plots his conquest of the Ezidian Realm and plans his invasion of Earth.  The only thing he fears is the hands of fate.
                    The twins learn what they must and train whenever possible.  Marques teaches them how to harness their vessels and trains them in the art of weaponry, but if he can&#39;t get the two to work together, then both worlds will be doomed.  Which, means if the hands of fate can&#39;t put their stubbornness aside, they may never see home again." />
