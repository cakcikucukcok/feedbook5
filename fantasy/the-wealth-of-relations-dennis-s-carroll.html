  <title>The Wealth of Relations - Dennis S. Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Wealth of Relations is a comic love story set in San Francisco during Christmas in the 1980s.  On a mountaintop that overlooks the bay, the Mayhews and the Douglases reunite their families for the holidays.  The Mayhews and two of their three sons are multimillionaires.  The Douglases are equally prosperous.  Surrounded by success stories, Harry Mayhew Junior hides his poverty and dedication to imagination, hoping through the riches of his personality to win the neighbors irresistible daughter Annie, a devoted doctor.
Harry finds support in Shannon Mayhew, his high-spirited and athletic 9-year-old niece who idolizes Unkie Harry, clinging to her hero like a 55-pound good luck charm.  Their nemesis is Harrys other niece, 11-year-old Violet Mayhew, who despises him and envies Shannon.  Violet ransacks Harrys luggage to unmask him as a hobo rather than a hero after Harry accidentally  frames her as a robber.  Harry battles Shannons disillusionment and Annies ultra-wealthy fianc while Annie wonders what to make of Harry stripped of camouflage. 
The Wealth of Relations honors underdogs, the secret dreams inspiring them to creativity in spite of economic failure, and their unexpected triumphs.  From a pawnshop and a tour of Alcatraz, where Harry feels at home, to Harrys verbal sorcery and a five-star meal with Annie at the Fairmont Hotel, the wheel of fortune spins until the underdogs are cornered and compelled to fight.  They show themselves as equal to the challenge in this witty and exhilarating novel when the final confrontations crown the comedy!" />
