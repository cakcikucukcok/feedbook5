  <title>Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President What We Don&#39;t, Can&#39;t, and Do Know??????? by Kathleen Hall Jamieson??????? | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President What We Don&amp;#39;t, Can&amp;#39;t, and Do Know &amp;nbsp;by Kathleen Hall Jamieson | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberwar is a path-breaking work on media research done in the past half-century.&lt;br /&gt;
Award-winning scholar Kathleen Hall Jamieson attempts to answer questions that are foremost in the minds of many Americans: How far-ranging is the trolling work? How was the social media exploited by the Russians? What compelled the mainstream media to use hacked messages in their news reports? How truthful was Clinton when she claimed debate moderators did not use authentic information from her leaked speeches? Was FBI director James Comey a victim of Russian influence? The New Yorker says the book provides a &amp;quot;meticulous analysis of online activity during the 2016 campaign&amp;quot; which shows the decisive effect of cyber-attacks made by Russia.&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberwar is authored by Jamieson who won the Henry Allen Moe Prize in the Humanities in 2016, awarded by the American Philosophical Society. Her other books include The Obama Victory and Packaging the Presidency.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Create Hours of Conversation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Foster&lt;/b&gt; a deeper understanding of the book&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Promote&lt;/b&gt; an atmosphere of discussion for groups&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Assist &lt;/b&gt;in the study of the book, either individually or corporately&lt;br /&gt;
