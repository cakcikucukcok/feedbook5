  <title>Spirit Dances (Luna) (The Walker Papers, Book 7) - C.E. Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;For Seattle detective Joanne Walker, spring is about new beginnings: She’s mastered her shamanic abilities (mostly); survived a cannibalistic serial killer (barely); and now she’s facing the biggest challenge of her career–attending a dance concert with her sexy boss, Captain Michael Morrison.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when the performance–billed as transformative–actually changes her into a coyote, she and Morrison have bigger things to deal with…. And there&#39;s more. Homeless people are disappearing, a mystical murder puts Joanne way out of her jurisdiction and with the full moon coming on, it&#39;s looking like the killer is a creature that can&#39;t possibly exist.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Jo could probably handle all of that, if one ordinary homicide hadn&#39;t pushed her to the very edge…. Cop or shaman? The choice isn&#39;t easy. But it&#39;s one she just might have to make….&lt;/p&gt;
