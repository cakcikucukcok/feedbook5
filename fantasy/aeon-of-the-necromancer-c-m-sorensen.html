  <title>Aeon of the Necromancer - C.M. Sorensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Livaris!&quot; Is what Haffenon shouted to destroy his enemy. A god who was once banished to an eternity of imprisonment beyond the reaches of man, or sorcerer. Yet not all deities such as the old one can remain still for too long. So after twenty thousand years of floating in the dark, and cold abyss... The once powerful entity known as Sarantrasi had escaped from the pits of despair, and anguish only to rise once again unto our peaceful world. In his stead to deliver the news of his arrival Krusani had begun to gather his flock of demons along with draping a perpetual darkness over the earth. It would be a long while until two men... one a Greek general of the bronze age, and his nemesis from the underworld are the only two people in existence to stop a prophecy from reaching its goal. Yet in order for both men to work together they must put aside their petty differences once, and for all if the universe is to survive sarantrasi&#39;s cruelty." />
