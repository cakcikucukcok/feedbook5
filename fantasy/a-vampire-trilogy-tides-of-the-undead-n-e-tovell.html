  <title>A Vampire Trilogy: Tides of the Undead - N. E. Tovell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Newlyweds Galian and Delbeth McDermot are the willing participants of an arranged vampire marriage to fulfill an ancient Celtic Prophesy. Moving to Ireland, they take their destined place as harbingers of a new world order.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Delbeth knows that Galian is the only vampire willing to tolerate her willful ways and unique Faerie gifts, but neither suspects that their enemies lurk in the shadows, preparing to destroy their fated existence.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Accustomed to the constant threats from the Croatian Tribunal, Delbeth is unaware that she has endangered Galianuntil he informs her that he will also be killed if she is captured. Cedric, their trusted bodyguard, has his work cut out for him, but even more surprising are the long-held secrets Galian reveals to Delbeth as their plane soars through the clouds to their new home.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hours later, Delbeth finds herself in a strange house, in a strange woods, in a strange country, facing a plot more sinister than neither she nor Galian ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;As Delbeth and Galian prepare to bring new leadership and hope to a world facing the terrifying possibility of extinction, both are left wondering if they can even trust one another.&lt;/p&gt;" />
