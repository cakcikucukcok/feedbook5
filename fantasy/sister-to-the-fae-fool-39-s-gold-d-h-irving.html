  <title>Sister to the Fae: Fool&#39;s Gold - D.  H. Irving</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Six months ago John Talik discovered that fairies were real, joined a secret government agency, and single-handedly stopped an evil entity from destroying the city.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And now, he&amp;rsquo;s bored.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With humanity saved and danger thwarted, the official training that he had been forced to skip out of necessity has come back to haunt him, and it&amp;rsquo;s worse than any monster that he could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The seemingly endless wonder and excitement that came with being thrust into the magical world of the Fae has taken backseat to boring lectures and dusty books that make him feel more like a desk jockey than the roguish secret agent that he always envisioned. His only real reprieve from the tedium of paperwork comes in the form a monthly meeting that he&amp;rsquo;s honor bound to attend, much to the delight of the rowdy band of leprechauns that host it. Or so he thought.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When an unprovoked attack from a mysterious wizard who refers to himself only as &amp;ldquo;Somnus&amp;rdquo; ties directly into the open investigation of missing students at the Agency&amp;rsquo;s very own preparatory school, it&amp;rsquo;s up to the agents of the FPI to figure out exactly what the connection is, and how to get the children back before they&amp;rsquo;re lost to the fairy realm, forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
