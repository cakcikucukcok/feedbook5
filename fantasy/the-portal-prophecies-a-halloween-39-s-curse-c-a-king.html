      <meta name="description" content="Why do prophecies have to speak in riddles? Willow&#39;s destiny led her to a whole book of them. If that wasn&#39;t bad enough a gypsy witch shows up and utters words that make even less sense. Was it a curse or another prediction?

King Cornelius&#39; plan to dominate every realm is woven into the mystery that surrounds every corner they turn. Following the clues will lead them on a journey through the spookiest time of the year.
&#39;Be forewarned on Hallows Eve
 those who are not of this world shall take to the streets,
 blood shall flow and death shall follow.
 Your presence attracts what we cannot explain.
Your destiny is written. You best make sure you listen.&#39;" />
