  <title>Delia&#39;s Shadow - Jaime Lee Moyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Jaime] Moyer creates a hauntingly real San Francisco, full of characters you can&#39;t wait to get to know better. &lt;i&gt;Delia&lt;/i&gt;&#39;&lt;i&gt;s Shadow&lt;/i&gt; is an engaging debut novel, one that cost me a good night&#39;s sleep.&quot; --Jim C. Hines, author of&lt;i&gt; Libriomancer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the dawn of a new century in San Francisco and Delia Martin is a wealthy young woman whose life appears ideal. But a dark secret colors her life, for Delia&#39;s most loyal companions are ghosts, as she has been gifted (or some would say cursed) with an ability to peer across to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the great quake rocked her city in 1906, Delia has been haunted by an avalanche of the dead clamoring for her help. Delia flees to the other side of the continent, hoping to gain some peace. After several years in New York, Delia believes she is free...until one determined specter appears and she realizes that she must return to the City by the Bay in order to put this tortured soul to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will not be easy, as the ghost is only one of the many victims of a serial killer who was never caught. A killer who after thirty years is killing again.  &lt;br&gt;And who is now aware of Delia&#39;s existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Moyer’s deft handling of her characters (all of them haunted in different ways, how clever!) had me rooting for them from the first page, and her depiction of turn-of-the-century San Francisco was pitch- perfect.—M. K. Hobson, author of Native Star, The Hidden Goddess and The Warlock’s Curse.<br /><b><i>Delia’s Shadow - Jaime Lee Moyer</i></b> | Jaime Lee Moyer writes fantasy and science fiction, herds cats, is an occasional poet, and maker of tangible things. Her first novel, Delia's Shadow, was published by Tor Books, and won the 2009 Literary Award for Fiction, administrated by Thurber House and funded by the Columbus Arts Council.<br /><b><i>Jaime Lee Moyer (Author of Delia's Shadow)</i></b> | Delia ' s Shadow is an engaging debut novel, one that cost me a good night's sleep.”. ― Jim C. Hines, author of Libriomancer. “Like fog creeping in from the Bay, this ghostly, romantic tale of San Francisco past made the outside world disappear and sent shivery tendrils into my soul.
