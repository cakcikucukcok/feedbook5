  <title>The Legend of Chip - Stanley E Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Christopher &amp;quot;Chip&amp;quot; MacDougall is a simple man, struggling with change and loss while providing for his family in 18th century Edinburgh, Scotland. But when a stranger offers him the opportunity to earn more money, his life is flipped upside down. Unexplainable things begin to happen and what was once accepted as good fortune quickly turns to adversity. Trying to make sense of what&amp;rsquo;s happening, he begins challenging everything he knows and believes. Desperate for answers, he leaves his family and joins the Navy.&lt;br /&gt;
While he is away, he is presumed lost at sea and his family is forced to move on without him. Upon his return, he begins to realize that everything isn&amp;rsquo;t what it seems. Dark forces are at work, lurking in the shadows and threatening to destroy more lives than just his own. If he wants to protect those he cares about, he&amp;rsquo;ll be forced to risk everything and confront the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
