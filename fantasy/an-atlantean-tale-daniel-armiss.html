  <title>An Atlantean Tale - Daniel Armiss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The ancient city of Atlantis is a civilization ruled by order, harmony, and law. But within King Dirllian and Queen Mirindas quarters, a tragedy has occurred; the queen has just had a miscarriage. It is a time of great mourning and everyone, from noble to lowly peasant, is expected to pay their respectsincluding twelve-year-old Dasha, whose father has a high position in the Atlantean council. Unfortunately, Dasha could not care less, for she has never even met her father.&lt;br /&gt;As the people of Atlantis mourn their royal loss, they also must mourn the loss of one of their Aura humans, a revered human with special powers and the kings right hand. With his father now departed from Earth, Adume Anatrian is left with nothing but the sacred book of the Aura humans. With rebel strength growing every day, responsibility has now fallen on Adumes shoulders to find a solution to save Atlantis from destruction. Meanwhile, Dasha, ever-curious about what lies beyond the great walls of the city, ignores her mothers warnings and climbs over the wall to discover a world like nothing she has ever known.&lt;br /&gt;In this fantasy thriller, as Dasha and Adume begin separate, yet equally as dangerous adventures beyond the palace walls, neither has any idea of the darkness that awaits their great civilization.&lt;/p&gt;" />
