  <title>1: The White Musketeer - Christina Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There&#39;s only one thing Erik Seeton wants in his pathetic teenage life: to be left alone to wallow in the superficial miseries of his rejected love. But that&#39;s not what destiny has planned for him.
One blisteringly cold December morning, Erik&#39;s friend Nate dares him to find the fabled French musketeer François Beauchamp&#39;s mansion in the woods. No one&#39;s ever seen it and most people think it&#39;s only a myth. When Erik and Nate actually find The Haunted Mansion, Erik discovers a breathtaking 17th century French rapier and claims it as his own.
However, taking the rapier awakens Mystic Art, a powerful form of magic passed down through DNA, thrusting Erik into the heart of millenniums of strife and the ongoing war between two forgotten brothers.
At first, Erik thinks he&#39;s the victim of circumstance. But he&#39;s quick to realize his friends and family are the ones in peril if he doesn&#39;t accept the magic forced upon him. Erik must confront and defeat an unleashed evil set on destroying the things he holds dear." />
