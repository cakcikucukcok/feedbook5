Local legends are true: bear shifters exist . . . and her nephew is part of their clan. As is Carl Carman, the sexy, larger-than-life man who has sworn to find her nephew-and the other young shifters who&#39;ve gone missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  As the leader of his clan, Carl is surrounded by enemies. He&#39;s learned the hard way that keeping a firm leash on his inner beast is key to survival, though his feelings for Becca test his legendary control. Then danger stalks too close, and Carl realizes he must unleash the raging, primal force within to protect everything he holds dear. But can Becca trust his grizzly side with her life-and her heart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
