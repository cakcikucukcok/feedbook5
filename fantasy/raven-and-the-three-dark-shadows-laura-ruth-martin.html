  <title>Raven and the Three Dark Shadows - Laura, Ruth Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Just when Sheila, Snapper and Pen are beginning to adjust to their lives, adopted into a new family, an old adversary emerges. Kalik, an evil sorcerer who they thought was vanquished, reappears. Unknown to the children, she has come back with her two evil sisters to destroy them. These three, dark shadows lurk and scheme a plot to steal the children&#39;s magical powers. A coven of good witches, deep in the heart of Stonehenge have mysteriously disappeared. Their bodies were never discovered... only the remains of their spell-books lay scattered. Glimpses of these witches have been spotted at the ancient, burial chamber, long forgotten, on the Northern shores of Ireland.&lt;p&gt;Snapper, Sheila and Pen find themselves on a quest to rescue them. Along the way they are given magical gifts to help them on this quest by mystical druids. They will need to rely on each other, their magical training and Raven&#39;s help if they are going to go up against the deadly, three, dark shadows!&lt;/p&gt;" />
