  <title>The Pull of Dreams - T.R. Quiñones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mankind was not meant to interfere with the nature of Dream
Realm. &lt;br&gt;
But what is Dream Realm? &lt;br&gt;
Scholars of old could sense it, but not explain it. Plato touched on it in his Theory of Forms, but the best he could achieve was a dubious narrative. The Ancient Egyptians tried to catalogue it, but came up short in their Book of Dreams. The I Ching,the Chinese Book of Changes, came surprisingly close to pin pointing it, but its clarity was lost to the test of time.&lt;br&gt;
Its defi ning nature is Chaos and Enlightenment. Composed
entirely from the sum of mankinds desires and the totality of his imagination, Dream Realm is potential unrealized. Where our
creativity is born and nurtured. Where the constraints of our
naivet is broken, allowing our minds to glimpse at what could
have been. A Perfect Paradise. &lt;br&gt;
Dream Realm is the balance to our waking world. &lt;br&gt;
But in his hubris, mankind has compromised that balance.&lt;br&gt;
There are cracks and fi ssures along the wall that divide us. &lt;br&gt;
The pressure is building and the dam is about to burst. &lt;br&gt;
The fate of all that is, and all that might have been, has fallen on the shoulders of one man. &lt;br&gt;
