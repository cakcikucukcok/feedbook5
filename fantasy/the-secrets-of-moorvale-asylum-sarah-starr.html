  <title>The Secrets of Moorvale Asylum - Sarah Starr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The war is over, and Britain is at peace. But in 1948, not only Londons architecture lies in tatters.
When Juliette is committed to the asylum, two memories haunt her: that of her baby being snatched from her arms and of fleeing on skis through an endless mountain range. Doctor Silver favors all forms of shock therapy, and its doubtful she can endure such barbaric treatments.
A missing patient links Silver to a police inquiry while he seeks help from the Movement, an illegal cell he knew before the war. Certain this ideology is the model for a better world, he is easily led into illicit schemes.
A troubled child discovers fairies have lived at the asylum long since its workhouse days. Their natural law seeks to restore peace and harmony, but dark secrets are gradually unearthed inside the walls of Moorvale. Unseen dangers now lurk in the shadows and further threaten Juliettes survival.
Follow each twist and become spellbound as the story weaves to its magical conclusion." />
