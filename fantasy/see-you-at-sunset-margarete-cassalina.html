      <meta name="description" content="Thirteen-year-old Jenna Rutherford is a frequent flyer at Club Med, also known as Westchester General Hospital. She has been admitted to the hospital twelve times already in her short life. Jenna has cystic fibrosis and she needs a miracle.

With her mother, Mary, constantly at her side, and Dr. Ben Grazer as her attentive doctor, Jenna maintains an upbeat attitude despite enduring long weeks of tests, x-rays, around-the-clock IV antibiotics, and constant medical attention. But Jenna and her mother have no idea that someone else is sharing her roomAlex Morgan, a spirit who was once a doctor in the hospital and Dr. Grazers best friend. As his story slowly unfolds, lives intersect and fate intervenes as a teenager connects it all and proves that love never ends.
In this poignant tale, a teenager challenged by cystic fibrosis is helped through her daily struggles by a compassionate doctor, her devoted mother, and a quiet spirit whose work on earth is not quite done." />
