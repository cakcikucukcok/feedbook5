  <title>The Golgotha Series - R. S. Belcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;R.S. Belcher&#39;s weird west world series is set in the damned and unnatural frontier town of Golgotha, a Nevada cattle town that hides more than its share of unnatural secrets.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; This Golgotha series discounted ebundle includes: &lt;i&gt;The Six-Gun Tarot, The Shotgun Arcana, The Queen of Swords&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wild, gritty, insanely inventive and a hell of a lot of fun!&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Jonathan Maberry&lt;/i&gt;, on &lt;i&gt;The Six-Gun Tarot&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Six-Gun Tarot&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sheriff bears the mark of the noose around his neck; some say he is a dead man whose time has not yet come. His half-human deputy is kin to coyotes. The mayor guards a hoard of mythical treasures. A banker&#39;s wife belongs to a secret order of assassins. And a shady saloon owner, whose fingers are in everyone&#39;s business, may know more about the town&#39;s true origins than he&#39;s letting on.

The town has come through many nightmarish trials. Now an army of 32 outlaws, lunatics, serial killers, and cannibals are converging on the town, drawn by a grisly relic that dates back to the Donner Party . . . and the dawn of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Queen of Swords&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maude Stapleton, late of Golgotha, Nevada, is a respectable widow raising a daughter on her own.  Few know that Maude belongs to an ancient order of assassins, the Daughters of Lilith, and is as well the great-great-great-great-granddaughter of Anne Bonney, the legendary female pirate.  Leaving Golgotha in search of her daughter Constance, who has been taken from her, Maude travels to Charleston, South Carolina, only to find herself caught in the middle of a secret war between the Daughters of Lilith and their ancestral enemies, the monstrous Sons of Typhon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tor books by R.
