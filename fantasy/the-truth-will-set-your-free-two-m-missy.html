  <title>The Truth Will Set Your Free????, Two - M Missy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We left off in the last book, THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE???? with a not guilty verdict in a murder case and later, a spanking from Cally at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I was looking forward to getting back to my nice quiet life at home being Callys maid and being Callys husband. To me that was better than going out of the house for most any reason. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
However, our lives just dont seem to be following my desires as before a week was over, David called Cally with another murder case where he was at a loss to formulate any defense for his client, Oliver. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, Cally and I interviewed Oliver, the accused, believed he was innocent and took on the challenge to find the truth that could set Oliver free. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The case did not turn out the way we expected and that turned out very bad for me. Oliver went to prison and Cally punished me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But, I never give up and started over and tried to find the truth. I was determined to set Oliver free. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the biggest surprises came with one of Americas most decorated Generals taking the witness stand; that was a real shocker. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then as life seems to be finding its own path, there were problems with milly and her sissy maid service to Molly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The FBI called and needed me to go undercover for them again to stop a policemen from sexual misconduct. Cally and I had a good time helping out this time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One day I was sitting there in the courtroom wondering where my normal life went; when I remembered what a very famous American once said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
DOC HOLIDAY, in response to Wyatt Earp one day told Wyatt; &lt;br&gt;
There is no normal life, there is just life &lt;br&gt;
So, I seem to be finding out. My life has turned into a fairy tale. &lt;br&gt;
The fairy tale continues; the sissy maid missy bad boy series. &lt;br&gt;
