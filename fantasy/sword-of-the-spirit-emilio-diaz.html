  <title>Sword of the Spirit - Emilio Diaz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Emilio presents an engrossing story rich with samurai struggles and rich texture. He really knows how to weave a story!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
William J. Hall, author of The Worlds Most Haunted House: The True Story of the Bridgeport Poltergeist on Lindley Street&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all-powerful emperor sends Sen-hi Sakeda, a female Samurai, on a diplomatic mission to America. She travels on a merchant ship across the sea from Japan, slaying pirates as she goes. She expects a moment of respite when she arrives in San Francisco. Instead, she is thrown in prison. Her diplomatic mission was a set-up to get her out of the emperors way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Army officer, also trained in the Samurai way, soon rescues her. Together, they learn of a misguided plot by Native American chief, Raven Black, to usurp and take over the seat of United States military power in California. Sen-hi vows to stop Raven Black, but he has dark magic with unprecedented reach that makes him a difficult adversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen-hi traverses the epic landmarks of the Western frontier as she is pursued and hunted by Raven Black and his minions of darkness. As battles rage, Sen-hi questions whether she should go to war or find a way to peace. Will her final decision lead to victory or bloody death? It all depends on whether she can survive the spirit of evil.&lt;/p&gt;" />
