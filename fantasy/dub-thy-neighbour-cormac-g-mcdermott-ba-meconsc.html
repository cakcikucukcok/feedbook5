  <title>Dub Thy Neighbour - Cormac G. McDermott Ba MeconSc.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;Dub Thy Neighbour&#39; is a compilation of five scenes. The dialogues are between two neighbours, one of which has been told another neighbour of theirs&#39; is the Counsellor. One of the two men in the conversations informs the other what their neighbour has had to reveal about himself, past, current, and future world events plus his struggles with mental illness all simultaneous with there being a conspiracy against him. 
The conversations are lighthearted but ones that the reader will find as creative and prophetic revelation as well as humorous. 
This book is very relevant to the times we are living in and about to enter into. 
It is a work of creative, imaginative, and prophetic genius." />
