  <title>Unearthed After Sunset - Lauryn April, Victoria Shockley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Greg Erickson is killed by sultry and seductive vampire Lila, he wakes up cold and alone in a wooden box. After clawing his way out, he finds himself thrust into a vampire turf war, unsure of exactly whose side he&amp;rsquo;s on and why he&amp;rsquo;s fighting. Greg discovers that it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to be human one day and hunting humans the next. While his new vampire cohorts push him to accept his newfound existence, there&amp;rsquo;s one girl from his human life he&amp;rsquo;s unable to forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caroline Christensen lived a normal life once. Then her brother was killed by vampires and her family legacy as a vampire hunter was handed down to her. When she meets Greg at a bar one night, they both feel an immediate connection. Then Greg discovers Caroline&amp;rsquo;s secret and she worries he&amp;rsquo;ll never talk to her again. She soon finds out that he has a very different reason for not calling &amp;ndash; he&amp;rsquo;s dead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Greg has become Caroline&amp;rsquo;s target, but can she bring herself to kill him? Greg, however, isn&amp;rsquo;t Caroline&amp;rsquo;s only concern. &amp;nbsp;The vampires are battling one another, and Caroline is determined to find out what they&amp;rsquo;re fighting over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
