  <title>Decree of the Watchers - Ruben Rios Cepero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a universe where nearly everyone ponders the meaning of their existence and believes humanity is alone in this reality, powerful inorganic beings from a mysterious realm outside time and space observe and make judgments that affect the course of human history in accordance with specific destinies. 
A man who has been stalked by evil since childhood is living within a dark world; bound by an unseen enemy, the Adversary, and hopelessly trapped in a prison inside his own mind. Adam is unaware of his special destiny and that Watchers observe and guide events on Earth and elsewhere to provide him an opportunity to freely choose to fulfill his purpose or follow a different path. Though the Watchers give meaning to his otherwise meaningless suffering, only time will tell which path Adam will choose. Will he choose his destiny and defeat his adversary or will he surrender and join him on the Dark Path?
Decree of the Watchers shares the tale of one mans journey to fulfill his extraordinary purpose with unseen help from powerful inorganic beings from another dimension." />
