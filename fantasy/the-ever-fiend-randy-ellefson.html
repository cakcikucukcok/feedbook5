The wizard will spare him if Talon performs a service &amp;ndash; fetch the deadly silver elixir from the Everway, a supernatural land that Talon assumed wasn&amp;rsquo;t real. Only children believe the stories about what lies within &amp;ndash; lost souls, corrupted magic items, and mysterious destinations that most people never escape. Ruling over it all is the Ever Fiend, a bogeyman that people use to scare unruly youngsters into behaving.

Their leader, a sorelia with nefarious plans of his own. The sorelia&amp;rsquo;s battle-trained mynx, a large cat who obeys only its master. An alluring swordswoman who wants to enchant her blades with the elixir. A cocky guard whose bravado might prove more liability than asset. A warrior kryll whose curiosity about the elixir might cost him more than his life. And a tortured Knight of Coiryn who seeks redemption in a place where most are damned. Of all the things they might discover on their journey, one is the most obvious and yet the hardest to learn&amp;hellip; Only a fool steals from the Ever Fiend.&lt;/p&gt;" />
