  <title>Descendants of the Ebony Path - Tony Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I would like to introduce you to UNREST, Book One of Descendants of the Ebony Path, a tale of the 12 Risen.
It is a tale of a world long since destroyed by technology, where the final gift of knowledge is the magic of genetic enhancement, and gifted men and women are are called the Anointed who stand as vanguards of free nations and champions of empires.
It is the tale of the Al-Kraal Empire. A expanding regime built by a repudiated scholar turned conqueror, whose ambitions are as brilliant as they are appalling.
It is the tale of the remarkable women of Venters Hall, where mastery of the female matrix has given women power to beggar the gods.
It is the tale of the 12 Risen. Twelve young men, some born in, others condemned to, a life of slavery. Twelve men whose rebellion reshaped a broken world.
Lastly, it is the tale of the Ebony Path, a rent in the fabric of the universe created by an ancient clash of powers. A place where roads lead to the very heart of creation and worlds known and unknown. A place where any who descend can find themselves subject to possession by merciless beings with angelic countenances.
Book One takes place nineteen years after the rebellion." />
