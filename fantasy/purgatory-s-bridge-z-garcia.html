      <meta name="description" content="Takashi Azuno is a nineteen-year-old boy just starting out in college, trying to live and fit in on his own but is having trouble (due to the fact that hes surprisingly and unintentionally antisocial, says his best friend Arashi), and it doesnt get better at all with the moment he bumped into Yosuna Hatake while running late to school (hes always late). Takashi found an old wooden box with ancient encryptions on it. During school a strange woman picked him up and claimed to be his girlfriend. It was Yosuna. After a subtle greeting and a fresh first kiss, he was dragged back to his apartment by Yosuna and was asked about the box. While trying to get it for her, he dropped the box, and out came two medallions with a bunch of drugs as cover-up. The moment he picked up one of the medallions, his story began while his chance at a normal life ended." />
