      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The sun beamed down upon the Turin Basilica presenting another spring day to the people of the region. Roses in the church courtyard slowly opening, expanding their petals towards the beams of light, a morning yawn to a new day of promise and jubilation of peace, but inside the church the talk will not be of peace, but of war. The double doors of the courtyard opens up with two monks pulling the large doors inward, the other side of the entrance gives way to holy crusaders who wear the red cross upon their chests and shields. The hooves of the steeds making a clanking sound against the courtyard cobblestones announcing their arrival. Standing upon the sun dried cobblestones that were covered with morning dew just moments before, the bishop appears.Greetings General Gelson, Bishop Bernard extending his hand upward towards the general of Britannia.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A short laugh escapes the generals mouth with a smiling grin towards the bishop. Nonsense my Lord, allow me to remove myself from my steed so I may come to you on bended knee and kiss your ring of holiness. General Crispin Gelson jumping from his horse to greet the bishop and meeting his eyes face to face, My good general Gelson, no reason to do such formal theatrics, I am just a man who serves the church. How was your journey from Britannia? General Clement Laurent of France has already arrived and is waiting for us in the meeting hall. You may inform your men that they can rest their horses and seek rest in Turin until we have formulated a joint plan of attack against the enemy. The muscular general turned towards his men and spoke through his thick beard. Boys, take your steeds to the church stables and enjoy the city until I call for you. The men under the generals command cheered with pleasure with the new order from their leader. The tall general once again faced his priestly friend and said. I am all yours my Lord, may we come to a conclusion for victory. The two friends walked into the meeting hall where they will make their plans for battle against the vampire empire and their Saracen warriors.&lt;/P&gt;" />
