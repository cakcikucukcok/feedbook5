  <title>Enchanted Castle on the River - Sylvia Abolis Mennear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Enchanted Castle on the River - Where your wishes and dreams come true - But be careful what you wish for.
Matthew is a young teenager about to go on a camping trip with his family to a wilderness camp.  He is a very imaginative young man that gets himself into trouble after 
venturing out on his own through the woods where he is confronted by the Wizard Zerkin, this alone is an unnatural and freakish experience.  Zerkin has a job and that is to lead
Matthew to the castle where he is told to make his wish.  Matthew is curious yet hesitant, he wants to wait until he can bring some friends along but Zerkin uses his powers to 
force Matthew to the Castle.  His families choice on campgrounds was not theirs but of a higher power and Matthew does not know that his wish had been planned for him.  
He was the chosen one for this adventure and along the way his experience is anything but amusing for him.
He finds himself transported into medieval times, his life takes on a new role as King Vincent&#39;s son.  Life as a prince turns out to be less of a fairy tail and more of a nightmare.  
His adventure is horrific and his younger brother wants him gone so he can be next in line for the throne.  Although he was brought here by King Vincent who is laying on his 
death bed and Zerkin, to break a spell that was put on Zerkin by his own mother Bianca when he was just a young child.  This spell must be broken before the King dies or
the village and all its people will be in dire trouble.  Matthew just wants back home to the 21st century but can&#39;t find his way.
This book is full of twists and turns you won&#39;t want to put it down." />
