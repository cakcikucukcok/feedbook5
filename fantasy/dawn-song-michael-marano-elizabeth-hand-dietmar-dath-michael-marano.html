  <title>Dawn Song - Michael Marano, Elizabeth Hand, Dietmar Dath, Michael Marano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A modern dark fantasy classic returns with this new, Special Edition of &lt;em&gt;Dawn Song&lt;/em&gt;, the soul-haunting novel from a Bram Stoker Award-winning author with a deeply powerful—and prescient—vision. Set in Boston at the start of the First Gulf War, a larger, supernatural battle for Supremacy in Hell takes shape . . . but plays out on a personal scale as unassuming humans careen into the path of a beautiful, terrible Succubus who has come to Earth to do her Father’s bidding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lawrence, a lonely book clerk, new to Boston, is just one wanting soul in a city full of them. His deepest desires call out to someone . . . anyone. But who will answer among the faceless crowds? A grieving son, a theology student tormented by doubt, the faithful, the mad: all are touched by the divine as the Succubus, who is both ancient and newborn, falls in love with the city even as she reaps the souls of her lovers. Her journey through our world comes at an unimaginable price. For in Hell, two powerful deities have awakened to use mankind as pawns in a monstrous conflict that will change the nature of damnation itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the iconic horror tradition of Clive Barker and Anne Rice, as well as of newer fantasy voices like Mike Carey and Tim Powers, &lt;em&gt;Dawn Song&lt;/em&gt; is a dark meditation on Salvation, full of terror and tenderness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
