  <title>Metamorphosis of Power - Greig Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Damien lives a life most people would dream of with money, looks and ability. He has also been through a lot, having never known his biological relatives and recently losing his foster family. He pushes forward though and lives a fulfilling life that he is in control of. Suddenly he is dragged into a world within the one that he has always known, where mystical ability is wielded by everyone and is part of everyday life. It is quickly identified that he is not just any wielder of this mystical power, but apparently is the fulfilment of a prophecy and is destined to lead his entire organisation back into its position as ultimate arbiters of the balance of power. How will he lead his people to stand against the threat from the enemy organisations? Can he face the consequences of his actions and choices on those he comes to care for? Will he be able to deal with the fact that fulfilling the prophecy comes at great personal sacrifice, the loss of his humanity?
