  <title>From Skeigh and Back . . . . . . . . with Love - Kathleen James-Carroll, Vic James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You know when you have been to see somewhere interesting, beautiful, and exciting or all three? Or just very old and quite boring, but you had to go because it was a school trip? While you were there, did you ever catch sight of a bluish-colored ghost? Lets get something straight here. Usually it would have been a well-known place because if it wasnt, they wouldnt have been there, and generally the being in question would have appeared to be enjoying itself and laughing like mad. If this hasnt happened to you, I dont want you to feel bad about it because the situation that I have described is a very rare occurrence. Blue ghosts are just not run of the millwell, not happy ones anyway.
The trouble with ghosts is that you never really know where they have come from or what they are doing in that particular place at that particular time. You dont know why they have decided to appear and frighten you to death, either. Well, I have got news for you. If you did see one of these blue people, it wouldnt be personal. It would be because their fade-out pill was not working properly. This is more common with child-size ghosts who have probably spit half of theirs out and not told their parents. 
Of course, they are not really ghosts; these fading in and out, giggling, happy-looking people. They are Skeignans, and Samantha and I decided to write about them one sunny afternoon whilst on holiday in Delphi. This is a beautiful sunny, ancient place in the mountains of Greece. In fact, the type of place Skeignans flock to when on holiday. We had seen one that morning, and that was what set us off.
Samantha wasnt at all shocked when we saw the Skeignan because she remembered that she had played with one called Michael when she was a child. It seems that he had got left behind when his family had gone home from a trip to see our local beauty spot in the northern Pennine hills of England. They had played often through the summer of 1992, and then one day he was gone. His parents had made it back for him. All Sam had left was a good-bye note, which she treasures until this day.
If I have caught your interest, do feel free to read on, and I will explain more about the Skeignans. The story is not about Michael, by the way. It is based upon a family called Grock who lived just down the road from him back on his own planet. If you want to read more about Michael, you are out of luck because I dont think anyone else has written about him either." />
