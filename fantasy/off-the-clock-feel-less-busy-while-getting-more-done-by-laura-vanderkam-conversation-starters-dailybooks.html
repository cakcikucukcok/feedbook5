      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Off the Clock: Feel Less Busy While Getting More Done &amp;nbsp;by Laura Vanderkam | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In May 2018, I Know How She Does It author Laura Vanderkam published her newest book Off the Clock: Feel Less Busy While Getting More Done. Most people feel that they are constantly behind. They are unsure how they can escape the feeling of being oppressed by busyness. Unlike other time-management gurus, Laura Vanderkam believes that to get more things done, we must first feel that we have been given all the time in the world. Most people have plans like reading a book or training for a triathlon but they just couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it because they feel like they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Laura Vanderkam reveals the tested principles that time-free people have learned and applied to their lives. In Off the Clock: Feel Less Busy While Getting More Done, she teaches mindset shifts that will truly help you feel calm even on the most frantic and busiest days. She equips us with tools to help us get more things done without feeling overwhelmed. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stand Out author Dorie Clark says that author Laura Vanderkam is &amp;ldquo;one of the world&amp;#39;s leading experts in time management and productivity.&amp;rdquo; She continued that her insights in Off the Clock &amp;ldquo;can change your life.&amp;quot; The Productivity Project author Chris Bailey says that Off The Clock &amp;ldquo;will show you how to spend your hours more meaningfully, reclaim vast amounts of wasted time, and live a better life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Create Hours of Conversation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Foster&lt;/b&gt; a deeper understanding of the book&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Promote&lt;/b&gt; an atmosphere of discussion for groups&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Assist &lt;/b&gt;in the study of the book, either individually or corporately&lt;br /&gt;
