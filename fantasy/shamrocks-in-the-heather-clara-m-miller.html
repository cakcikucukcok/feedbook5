  <title>Shamrocks in the Heather - Clara M. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Warning: this is not a religious book!
	Shamrocks in the Heather is the fifth book in the Brothers Series and the first in the Shamrocks Saga. It continues the story of the on-going battle between Michael the Archangel and his brother Lucifer by going back in time to trace the history of Theodora and Theodosia Quigley, the mysterious twins mentioned in the previous books. The story begins with the twins grandparents, Rory and Mary Ann Quigley and their beginnings in Ireland. Forced by circumstances to move to Scotland, they set about creating a new life for themselves and their growing family. Their oldest child, Conor, begins the family tradition of seeing and forming a close association with his Guardian Angel. These associations deepens quickly into warm and unique friendships and, time and time again, will prove to be critical. They same friendships also make the family the subject of much curiosity.
	The birth of the other Quigley children: Erin, Ethna, Angus and Martin, leads deeper and deeper into the story. World War I and the terrible flu pandemic that followed subjected the family to tragedy and heartbreak. Their mettle is tested again and again as time goes on. Perhaps its this testing that helps form the steel backbones of Theodora and Theodosia who will not be born until Martin moves to London and begins his career as a journalist. Ahead many joys, tragedies and surprises await the Quigleys and time alone will tell if theyre up to the challenge..
	As with the others in the series, this is not a religious book nor meant to endorse or promote any type of belief. It is intended to provide a verbal roller-coaster ride. Plus, Ive grown to quite like The Old Man. I hope you have too. Enjoy!
