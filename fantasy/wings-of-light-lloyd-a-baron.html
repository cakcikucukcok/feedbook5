  <title>Wings of Light - Lloyd A. Baron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Darwin&#39;t Utsa is a weaver, living in the hills with his Aunt and about to be bonded to his childhood love. His life is set before him and he is bored with it. He has dreamed of adventure and of travel across the world of Atlantia but knows now that can never happen. That is until his best friend takes him into the caves under the old well. Darkness swarms the world and Darwin&#39;t finds that he is the focal point of an ancient and forbidding prophecy. Charged with the job of saving the Last Princess of Atlantia he must leave his quiet life behind and plunge into a waking nightmare of ghouls, dark wizards and dragons. He will not be alone, for the prophecy tells of heroes who will follow him into the final days of the world.
But the prophecy is not complete. The end has not been written. A dark watcher has his eyes turned upon the world of Atlantia. And a small child who dreams of having Wings of Light may be the key to the very end of existence of everything Darwin&#39;t holds dear.
All he wants now is a simple life in the hills with the woman he loves." />
