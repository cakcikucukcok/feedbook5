Rejeena escapes death by a hairs breadthsaved by Aarvan, her queens man and slave. Ishtabarra, angered and frustrated by his interference, places a price on Aarvans head. Anyone can collect the bounty. Avarice and hostile forces aboundback way groups, loose men, wander women. Assuredly, some will seek the reward and notorietyperhaps the queens own guards?
Rejeena and Aarvan will each traverse personal corridors. The queen must transcend generations of ingrained bigotry such as men are working slaves, good only for procreation. He struggles to surmount the physical agony and mental misery of slave status.
