  <title>Amanda&#39;s Room Travel Edition - Chuck Miceli, Richard LaPorta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A STORM IS COMING&amp;nbsp;AND HER NAME IS AMANDA!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Death came for Amanda Reynolds, but could not pry her from her home. Her spirit remained and for the next two decades, the abandoned mansion decayed&amp;nbsp;but not Amanda&amp;#39;s room. When Katie Jarvis and her teammates enter the room, they discover an environment that is perfect in virtually every way. Under the guidance of their professor, world-renowned physicist Bertrand Myers, Katie, Chris, Drew, and Tess research the room&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;environment only to learn that it defies any natural explanation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Katie discovers that the room also affects the weather for miles around, the team delves into the house&amp;rsquo;s history, only to have each of them targeted for disaster. Through it all, Katie believes that Amanda still inhabits the room and&amp;nbsp;is convinced that Amanda is using the weather in a desperate attempt to communicate something, but neither she nor her team can decipher what or why. Bert cautions that if Amanda possesses&amp;nbsp;that kind of power, no one on earth is safe. However, when a monstrous late-season hurricane traps him and thousands of others on Cape Cod, Katie realizes that only she can stop Amanda before it&amp;#39;s too late. What she does not realize, is that something is still out to stop her.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chuck Miceli combines his criminal justice background and fascination for severe weather in his acclaimed supernatural novel, &amp;ldquo;Amanda&amp;#39;s Room.&amp;quot; Part mystery, part thriller, Miceli&amp;#39;s novel merges details from his experiences in prisons and jails with facts about severe weather and violent storms. Then he adds his own mix of paranormal coincidences to act as a catalyst for this supernatural stew. Together, these forces set the stage for what happens in the story and in the lives of its characters. Set in Washington Irving&amp;#39;s Hudson Valley, the book challenges readers to uncover the mysterious source of power in Amanda&amp;#39;s room. Then, in &amp;quot;Perfect Storm&amp;quot; fashion, he takes them on a violent-weather thrill ride of thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This revised version of the original edition&amp;nbsp;omits the weather quotes that introduce each chapter and some of the character development background. With its smaller format and&amp;nbsp;faster-paced read it is the perfect companion for vacation and travel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
