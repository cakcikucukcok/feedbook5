  <title>A Fortress of Grey Ice - J. V. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Wonderful . . . J. V. Jones is a striking writer.&quot; So says Robert Jordan, the author of &lt;i&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/i&gt; epic fantasy series. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Jones lives up to that praise in the highly charged epic adventure of Ash March and Raif Sevrance, two outcasts whose fate are entwined by ancient prophecies and need, in the cold, dark world that threatens to be torn asunder by a war to end all wars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolated by their birthrights, they are but two who fight the dreaded Endlords, and their strength and courage will be needed if the world is to be saved from darkness.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Raif, wrongly accused and cut off from his clan by the treachery of their new headsman, has a talent for killing that is part of his curse and his burden. But he bears another burden of greater weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ash is a sacred warrior to the Sull, an ancient race whose numbers have declined. Raised as a foundling, never knowing her true history, she must learn to accept the terrible gifts of her heritage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Ash learns more of her greater fate, Raif&#39;s task looms dark and desperate, for he must journey through the nightmare realm of the Want, a place where even the Sull now fear to tread. For deep within the Want is the Fortress of Grey Ice, and there he must heal the breach in the Blindwall that already threatens the world. Should he fail, not even Ash&#39;s powers can save them. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
