  <title>Witchmark - C. L. Polk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINNER of the 2019 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel, and a finalist for the Nebula Award, the Locus Award, and the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Lammy Award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the best books of 2018, according to NPR, &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;Chicago Review&lt;/i&gt;, BookPage, and the B&amp;N Sci-Fi and Fantasy Blog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;C. L. Polk arrives on the scene with &lt;i&gt;Witchmark&lt;/i&gt;, a stunning, addictive fantasy that combines intrigue, magic, betrayal, and romance. The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; calls it &quot;thoroughly charming and deftly paced... an accomplished and enjoyable debut.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an original world reminiscent of Edwardian England in the shadow of a World War, cabals of noble families use their unique magical gifts to control the fates of nations, while one young man seeks only to live a life of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Magic marked Miles Singer for suffering the day he was born, doomed either to be enslaved to his family&#39;s interest or to be committed to a witches&#39; asylum. He went to war to escape his destiny and came home a different man, but he couldn&#39;t leave his past behind. The war between Aeland and Laneer leaves men changed, strangers to their friends and family, but even after faking his own death and reinventing himself as a doctor at a cash-strapped veterans&#39; hospital, Miles can&#39;t hide what he truly is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a fatally poisoned patient exposes Miles&#39; healing gift and his witchmark, he must put his anonymity and freedom at risk to investigate his patient&#39;s murder. To find the truth he&#39;ll need to rely on the family he despises, and on the kindness of the most gorgeous man he&#39;s ever seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
