  <title>The Curse Within Me - Arnie Grimm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Even though `The Wizard Within Me&#39; had a happy ending, there were some in the magical world not very happy. `The Curse Within Me&#39; continues the story of Agnes and Harriet along with the town of Broomstick. The day Zimmer Wardcrystal the ghoul drove into town, darker forces than black magic itself cursed Broomstick.
You can enjoy reading this book without reading the first book. However, once drawn into this world, you&#39;ll want to know every little secret that the town of Broomstick has to hide. You&#39;ll be asking, &quot;Where is Book Three?&quot;
