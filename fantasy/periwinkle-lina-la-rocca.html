Fairy Princess Bianca and her loving companion Luke live well until an impious Moth Master of Druines pushes them off the very tip of the horn and casts a spell on them so they are never to remember their life in Chiaro.

Periwinkle makes a dangerous trip to the Kingdom of Druines to ask his friend Waldo, a dragosaurus, for help. Waldo agrees to hide a very crucial piece of evidence in his puff of red smoke. Later, after a brief encounter with Cara, Periwinkle promises to return. Unfortunately, it is at this time when the fairy tale takes a turn for the worsePeriwinkle is scooped up by a Moth Masters serrated fingernail and dropped on the cold ground of the Kingdom of Druines. 
Read this wonderfully written tale to find out if Periwinkles perseverance can combat the Moth Masters malevolence and ensure that the lovers will forever live happily thereafter." />
