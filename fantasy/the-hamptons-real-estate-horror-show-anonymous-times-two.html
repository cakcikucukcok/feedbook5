  <title>The Hamptons Real Estate Horror Show - Anonymous Times Two</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its summer in The Hamptons and people are behaving badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renters and buyersthe rich, the famous, the bad, and the uglyare out in full force with one mission: to ?nd the perfect house. Do they care that they are mistreating everyone, including the valiant real estate agents working for them? Absolutely not. They have abandoned civility (if they ever had any).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these stories, so revealing that the two authorswho together have logged some 50 years in real estatemust remain anonymous, the seamy underbelly of Hamptons Real Estate is exposed to the bright, often hilarious, light of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email screeches, You and your cougar girlfriend should read the fn lease! A landlord accuses, Your dog dug up my lawn! (Reply from dog owner: I dont have a dog!) A woman demands, I MUST have a house South of the Highwayby the way, what is South of the Highway? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towels arent ?u? y enough; birds are too noisy and should be eliminated; No Viking Range? Forget it! You get me a beach sticker or Ill badmouth your name all over town! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These true tales give a brokers-eye view of what really happens in the Hamptons Real Estate scene. You couldnt make this stu?  upand these two authors didnt.&lt;/p&gt;" />
