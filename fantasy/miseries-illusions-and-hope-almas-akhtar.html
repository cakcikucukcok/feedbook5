      <meta name="description" content="My second bookMiseries, Illusions and Hopeis a collection of few short stories I wrote in the last few years. Most of them appeared on my blogs on Facebook and Blogger.
These stories are about everyday people who are working hard for themselves and their loved ones. I call these people everyday heroes. They may be illiterate or poor, but they are sincere and trustworthy. They touch the lives of others around them.
Life is highly unpredictable and very complicated. It silently teaches us so much about love, intrigue, conflict, and persistence." />
