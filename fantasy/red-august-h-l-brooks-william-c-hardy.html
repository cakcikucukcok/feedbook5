      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if you found out that you were descended from a long line of clandestine fighters, and that your family was still at war? August Archer thinks she&amp;#39;s a normal teenage girl&amp;mdash;even if she has been having disturbing erotic dreams about wolves lately. Still grieving over the loss of her father, and wondering over his final gift of a red hooded cloak, August is uprooted from her big city apartment to a tiny town in Maryland, where she meets an enigmatic, irresistibly fascinating man who refuses to talk to her, yet who fuels her most intense romantic fantasies.
