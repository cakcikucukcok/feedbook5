  <title>Dinosaur Rock - C. H. Davidson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Set in the fictional remote and tiny hamlet of Shadow Lake, the story is told by Austin, a eleven year old boy who finds that he can change himself into a dinosaur and visit the real dinosaurs of long ago. After the first few visits to the dinosaurs, Austin becomes aware of how simple and clear their life is and how clean their world seems, in spite of natural upheavals that happens in the dinosaur world. With the support of his two cousins and eventually many of the townspeople, Austin is able to bring back to his world some of the things he has learned by going to see the dinosaurs. He is also able to rethink the problems his family is experiencing and to sort out his own relationship with his new step father. Finally he is able to persuade the towns people to help free the town from the pollution that has developed there. Some secrets from the past are revealed and an old man, that has befriended Austin and his cousins over the years, is finally able to live his life free from secrets." />
