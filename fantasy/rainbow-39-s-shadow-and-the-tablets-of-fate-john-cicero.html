  <title>Rainbow&#39;s Shadow and the Tablets of Fate - John Cicero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rainbows Shadow and the tablets of fate is an adventure/fantasy tale about two novels, Rainbow Alley  and The Sorcerers Shadow which have been mysteriously melded together creating an alternative dimension that has begun to write itself.
The first novel, Rainbow Alley, is a mythical and magical novel of pure paradise as told and written by Joseph Collins to his grandson, Will Collins. The second novel, The Sorcerers Shadow is an adventure filled novel full of evil, sorcery and mayhem spewed throughout its pages and is the favorite story of Wills brother, Bryan Collins. As these two novels unify, they become more then mere pages, as a blend of good and evil begin to emerge into reality.
Rainbow Alley is a surreal paradise Grandpa Joe has claimed to actually visited when he was younger. It can only be accessed through a golden portal by bringing four critical elements together.
One magical night, as the four elements are sought to come together to gain access to Rainbow Alley, the unthinkable happens.  By accidentally placing The Sorcerers Shadow novel underneath theRainbow Alley novel during the joining of only three of the four critical elements, Bryan has unknowingly set off the melding of these two stories. This creates their access to a new story and a land unlike anything the boys could ever imagine.  However, this access would prove to be near fatal for Grandpa Joe, as he is stricken by a mythical force that sends him into a mysterious coma.
Will and his best friend and neighbor, Jimmy Foster, set off on a journey, through the golden portal and into the merged stories in an effort to save his stricken grandfather
While in this new and sometimes foreboding and pleasurable land, Will is driven by a voice, claiming to show him the way to heal his grandfather.  What the boys encounter is incomprehensible, as they experience a blend of paradise, infiltrated by evil, sorcery and mayhem first hand." />
