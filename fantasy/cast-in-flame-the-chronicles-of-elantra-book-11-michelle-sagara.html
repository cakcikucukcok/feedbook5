  <title>Cast in Flame (The Chronicles of Elantra, Book 11) - Michelle Sagara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Any day that starts with dragon arguments is going to be bad&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kaylin returned from the West March in one piece. Now that piece is fraying. She&#39;s not at home in the Imperial Palace and she never intends to be. All she wants is normal garden-variety criminals and a place of her own. Of course, normal in her new life involves a dragon as a roommate, but she can handle that.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She can&#39;t as easily handle the new residents to the city she polices, because one of them is Nightshade&#39;s younger brother. On a night when she should be talking to landlords in perfectly normal buildings, she&#39;s called to the fief by Teela. A small family disagreement has become a large, complicated problem: Castle Nightshade&#39;s latent magic is waking.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And it&#39;s not the only thing.&lt;/p&gt;
