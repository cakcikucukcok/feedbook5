  <title>Not Flesh Nor Feathers - Cherie Priest</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Down by the river, the first to go missing were not much lamented. Disappearances of homeless men foraging through trash or nuisance skater kids who rolled their boards along the planked piers at night were not noteworthy enough to delay the city&#39;s development projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But deep beneath the riverbank, the evidence of a terrible crime has been covered up twice. When a TVA dam falters and the river swells, panic rises downtown. As the Tennessee creeps over its banks, it dredges up death from its own polluted bed. Twenty-nine victims of a long-ago slaughter walk when the water rises, patrolling the banks and dragging the living down to a muddy grave. No one remembers how they died and no one knows what they want. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some secrets are never washed away. Instead they are patient, biding their time. They wait for the water to lift them so they can prowl for the justice that was denied them ninety years ago. But in ninety years a city&#39;s shape changes, and where justice can no longer be found, vengeance may have to suffice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Chattanooga is about to learn a terrible truth about the things a river can and cannot hide.... And reluctant medium Eden Moore may be the only one who can dissuade the twenty- nine bodies from adding hundreds of its citizens to their ghastly ranks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not Flesh Nor Feathers&lt;/i&gt; is a stand-alone sequel to &lt;i&gt;Four and Twenty Blackbirds&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wings to the Kingdom&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Not Flesh Nor Feathers - Cherie Priest</i></b> | I wasn't as impressed with Not flesh Nor Feathers, as with Priest's last two books. A couple characters felt wooden...the sense of danger wasn't as palpable, and the pacing was slow and made the book harder to get into. The romantic tension between two characters wasn't very obvious and was rather surprising to note.<br /><b><i>Not Flesh Nor Feathers: Cherie Priest: 9780765313102 ...</i></b> | Cherie Priest's novels about Eden Moore, who sees ghosts and other sorts of dead in Chattanooga, are consistently excellent. Not Flesh Nor Feathers, the third book of the series, is happily no exception to this rule. She continues to bring the Creepy to Chattanooga, drawing on the rich and oftentimes genuinely creepy in real life history of the South to lay down her tales.<br /><b><i>Not Flesh Nor Feathers (Eden Moore, #3) by Cherie Priest</i></b> | And reluctant medium Eden Moore may be the only one who can dissuade the twenty- nine bodies from adding hundreds of its citizens to their ghastly ranks. Not Flesh Nor Feathers is a stand-alone sequel to Four and Twenty Blackbirds and Wings to the Kingdom. The Tennessee River has swollen again, and nothing stops it.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Not Flesh Nor Feathers - Cherie Priest</a> </h3></p><hr/>
