  <title>Prince Charming Doesn&#39;t Live Here - Christine Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Danice Carter is not one for glass slippers. A stilettos-wearing lawyer at one of Manhattan&#39;s most elite establishments, Danice has a very strong grip on reality. So when she&#39;s asked by one the firm&#39;s founding partners to take on a personal case, Danice knows she&#39;s in for the opportunity of a lifetime. All she has to do is convince her top boss&#39;s granddaughter, Rosemary, to file a paternity suit. Sounds simple enough...until Danice arrives at Rosemary&#39;s home and is pounced on by a handsome stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private investigator McIntyre Callahan&#39;s was only following his powerful client&#39;s orders: Find Rosemary--&lt;i&gt;at all costs&lt;/i&gt;. Instead, he&#39;s found a super-hot lawyer prowling around looking for answers he can&#39;t give. The half-human, half-Fae Mac tries to warn Danice that she&#39;s way in over her head--that Rosemary may roam among The Others, and may have dangerous ties to the Unseelie Court--but she won&#39;t be deterred. Even if that means following Mac to the ends of the earth to find Rosemary...or surrendering to his supernatural powers of temptation...until death do they part.&lt;/p&gt;" />
