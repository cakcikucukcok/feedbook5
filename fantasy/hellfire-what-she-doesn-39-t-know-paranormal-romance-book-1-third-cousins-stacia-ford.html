  <title>Hellfire - What She Doesn&#39;t Know: (Paranormal Romance) (Book 1) - Third Cousins, Stacia Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lucy has always known that she was different from the other kids in her home. Of course, it doesn&#39;t help that she suffers from a recurring nightmare that wakes her up with a scream on her lips and sweat pouring down her back. The nightmare is driving her crazy. She&#39;s too scared to sleep, she&#39;s too tired to live and she feels as though it&#39;s never going to get better...until Daniel shows up, that is.  Daniel knows why Lucy is suffering from nightmares. He knows that it&#39;s because of the memories that she has locked away inside her mind. He knows this because he&#39;s the one who locked them there. When Lucy gets in trouble and he puts the word out about her disappearance, he unknowingly starts a chain reaction that puts her in more danger than she has ever been in before. What will he do when his own brothers go up against him, and will he be able to save Lucy before it&#39;s too late?" />
