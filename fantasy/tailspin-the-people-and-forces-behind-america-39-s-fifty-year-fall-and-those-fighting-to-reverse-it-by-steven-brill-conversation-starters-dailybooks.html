  <title>Tailspin: The People and Forces Behind America&#39;s Fifty-Year Fall--and Those Fighting to Reverse It by Steven Brill | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Tailspin: The People and Forces Behind America&amp;#39;s Fifty-Year Fall--and Those Fighting to Reverse It&amp;nbsp;by Steven Brill | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bestselling author and award-winning journalist Steven Brill published his newest book Tailspin: The People and Forces Behind America&amp;#39;s Fifty-Year Fall &amp;mdash; and Those Fighting to Reverse It. In this book, Brill explores how broken the American society has become in the past few decades. He brilliantly explains how America&amp;rsquo;s values have deteriorated over the years. He tackles the core values like free speech, democracy, due process, meritocracy and innovation. According to Brill, the destruction of these values led to the deterioration of the American&amp;rsquo;s sense of responsibility and hope, among others. Brill examines the forces and people who initiated the rise of the lobbying financial and legal engineering and how the private sector unions declined over the years. He discusses the ongoing American bureaucracy and answers the questions that echo in the minds of Americans today &amp;ndash; How did the great nation of America end up this way?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paul Rosenberg of Salon describes Tailspin &amp;ldquo;a compelling story.&amp;rdquo; The Next Revolution author Steve Hilton says that Tailspin is &amp;ldquo;an absolute must-read.&amp;rdquo; Library Journal praises Brill&amp;rsquo;s book and describes it as &amp;ldquo;an eye-opening and engrossing treatise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
