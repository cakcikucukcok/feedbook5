  <title>Heroes of Bardoom: Verdan Chronicles: Volume 3 - David Gerspach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In The Fourth Age heroes from across Verdan were summoned to oppose Terek, a wizard bent on world domination. In Dark Passages those heroes led by the Lady Y&#39;Shanarra and the brave crusader, Trevor, braved the ancient evils of Kyrotha and the unknown horrors of the Khanian caves to reach Izmir, the base of Terek&#39;s new world order. Sacrifices were made, but those that survived have finally reached their destination.  In Heroes of Bardoom, those that oppose Terek find a country at odds with itself and less than fully committed to their leader&#39;s vision. Yet Terek&#39;s power and reach have brought most of the human civilization under his control. A surprise from Terek&#39;s past and a bargain struck of necessity have likewise placed the dragons in Terek&#39;s debt. Now, it appears that only the elves stand between the wizard and total control of Verdan. And so Terek has summoned the elven kings and queens to Bardoom for a council that will determine all their fates." />
