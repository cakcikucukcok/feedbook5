  <title>The Secrets of Magic and Metaphysics - Lynette Asmar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stanley always knew that his spiritual aspirations would cause a problem in his relationship with Catherine, but being an apprentice to a powerful metaphysician was the most important thing in his life, and he was totally committed to it.
Stanleys, fellow apprentice, John Korner, gets sucked through a
magic globe that is really a portal to the fourth dimension. In spite of all the frantic efforts to rescue John, he remains imprisoned in the dreaded lowlands of the fourth dimension by an evil sorcerer who is under the control of demonic forces.
Stanley meets an earth zone intelligence, Amouki who decides to assist him in rescuing his friend.  She helps him as he travels through dark and dangerous realms on his perilous journey and allows him to experience practically the things about which he has only basic theoretical knowledge.  
Even though he meets many beings of the light force along the way, this journey is taken at tremendous personal cost as he is forced to take spiritual initiation before his time so he can activate his newly awakened abilities at the crucial moment
of confrontation with the dark forces.
He will be forced to make a decision that will totally change his life and the lives of those he loves most dearly.
Will he ultimately lose the woman he loves, and will all the hardships connected with reaching a new level of consciousness be worth the tremendous effort required to learn the 
secrets of magic and metaphysics?" />
