  <title>Infractus - Sarah L Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Abandoned as a newborn, a nameless boy roams the streets of Vancouver like a mouse, living by few rules, under the wing of a charismatic grifter, while a voice in his head whispers very bad things in the night. When a terrorist attack destroys the global balance of power, society bleeds into anarchy. For the mouse to survive, his rules have to change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
From the ashes of chaos, Panopticon rises, a shadow regime exercising control through surveillance, and the occasional act of erasure. The mouse - now a man - becomes an invisible assassin in their New World Order. It&amp;#39;s a dirty job, but for a nameless misanthrope with a terrible voice in his head, it&amp;#39;s just about perfect. At least, until he&amp;rsquo;s nearly decapitated by a strange woman with an even stranger proclamation of looming Armageddon. She offers him a choice: help her destroy Panopticon, or take a seat for the end of the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The voice in his head has been biding its time, armed with a secret as old as time, as old as the world itself. It waits to speak an ancient name that will invite a reckoning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
An edgy, subversive apocalypse tale that explores the depths of human existence and the heights of our collective fears. Another spectacular adventure from Coffin Hop Weird&lt;/p&gt;" />
