      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fid was born and raised on earth, the offspring of a human father and a mother of elf descent. This young half-elf seeks revenge for the destruction of his village and the murders of those he called his family when he was just fifteen years old. Now eighteen, his hunt for the murderous vampires has led him from earth to a land called Rhydin, a world of many races, rich history, and wielders of great power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he arrives on Rhydin, Fid is rescued from bounty hunters by a clan of elves. King Aero offers him the opportunity to be a leader within his army. But this path leads Rhydin into a raging war between the Elf Empire and the Dark Warlord who seeks to overtake the land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He battles with Orcs, finds his fate intertwined with others, and even faces death. Fid must realize his destiny to cleanse Rhydin of its evil.&lt;/p&gt;" />
