  <title>~Temporarily~ - Shania Soler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Does anyone ever really die?
Or
Is it just that some lives are different than others?
After years and years, or rather centuries and centuries, of mourning over her brothers death, Lia finally thought that she was over it. Shes proven wrong when she continuously visits his grave. The reason for this is because Lia still feels a responsibility. Ever since that day ages ago, Lia has told herself that its her fault that hes dead.
Her every day visits to her brothers grave are soon put on hold though when a new guy shows up in Denver, Colorado. He goes by the name Tristan. As soon as Lia hears the name, something goes off in her head telling her shes heard it before. Only thing is, she cant remember where or when. Aside from his name, as soon as their first meeting is over, its clear that hes taken an interest in her. But since the day Tristan showed up nothing good has come to Lia. Murders start happening, Emotions that dont make sense to Lia come up, an old friend comes back, a promise is remembered, and memories start to rouse from a long forgotten slumber. Lias everyday normal life is no longer around, nor will it ever be again. She must stay hidden as best she can and try to stay away from Tristan. The only faulty in that plan is that Tristan my very well be the only thing bringing back those lost emotions along with some valuable memories." />
