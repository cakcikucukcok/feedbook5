  <title>Blood of the Demon - Rosalie Lario</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Keegan lives to exact revenge on the evil demon who sired and abused him. When his father devises a plan to bring on the apocalypse, he and his three half-brothers, interdimensional bounty hunters for the Elden Council, are charged with capturing and delivering their father for punishment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Art gallery owner Brynn Meyers has no idea that her ability to read memories embedded in objects and drain people of their life force means she has demon ancestry. Unfortunately for Brynn, she&#39;s also the key to raising an ancient zombie army, which puts her on every demon&#39;s Most Wanted List. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And no one wants her more than Keegan&#39;s father. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keegan must protect Brynn from his father by any means necessary, but he&#39;ll have to learn to harness the other half of his genetics--the far deadlier, uncontrollable half--when he starts to fall for the one woman standing between him and the vengeance he so desperately seeks. The one woman he&#39;ll never be able to resist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Demons of Infernum series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Book #1 Blood of the Demon&lt;br&gt; Book #2 Mark of the Sylph&lt;br&gt; Book #3 Touch of the Angel&lt;br&gt;Book #3.5: Heart of the Incubus&lt;br&gt; Book #4 Call of the Siren&lt;/p&gt;" />
