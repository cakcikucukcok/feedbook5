  <title>Lords of the Housetops: Thirteen Cat Tales - Carl Van Vechten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is  Carl Van Vechten&#39;s 1921 collection of short stories, &quot;Lords of the Housetops&quot;. Every story is linked by a common theme of cats, each telling a fantastic tale of feline adventure and daring-do. This volume is ideal for children with a love of cats, and it would make for a charming addition to family collections. The stories include: &quot;Cats&quot;, &quot;The Cat&quot;, &quot;Zut&quot;, &quot;A Psychical Invasion&quot;, &quot;The Afflictions Of An English Cat&quot;, &quot;Gipsy&quot;, &quot;The Blue Dryad&quot;, &quot;Dick Baker&#39;s Cat&quot;, &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, &quot;Madame Jolicoeur&#39;s Cat&quot;, &quot;A Friendly Rat&quot;, &quot;Monty&#39;s Friend&quot;, &quot;The Queen&#39;s Cat&quot;, and &quot;Calvin&quot;. Carl Van Vechten (1880 - 1964) was an American photographer and writer. He was interested in black writers and creatives, and supported the Harlem Renaissance, helping many black artists publish their work, including Langston Hughes, Ethel Waters, and Richard Wright. He was also the literary executor of Gertrude Stein, the famous American novelist, poet, and playwright. Other notable works by this author include: &quot;Firecrackers. A Realistic Novel&quot; (1925), &quot;The Blind Bow-Boy&quot; (1923), and &quot;Spider Boy&quot; (1928).  Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
