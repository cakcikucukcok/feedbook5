  <title>Nectar and Ambrosia - E. M. Hamill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Callie, a Classics major, flees home to protect her family from a monster straight out of mythology.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Visions lead her to Nectar and Ambrosia: the weirdest pub on Earth, where inter-dimensional travelers with attention seeking issues get drunk in between the A-list celebrity lives they create. They can&amp;#39;t pretend to be gods anymore&amp;mdash;not since a treaty with the current Supreme Deity promising they won&amp;#39;t intervene in human affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Doorkeeper of this threshold, Florian, rides herd on the rowdy Amaranthine and offers her shelter and a job. Callie likes the lonely, mysterious bartender more than she should. For Florian, her presence is&amp;nbsp;a ray of light in the gray monotony of his sentence behind the bar, but he keeps a cautious distance&amp;mdash;the truth of how he became Doorkeeper could change Callie&amp;#39;s perception of him forever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When angels show up for a war council over Zeus&amp;#39;s irrational mutters about a comeback, Callie has uncontrolled visions of an apocalypse.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ex-gods realize she&amp;rsquo;s the first Oracle Priestess in generations. All Callie wanted was keep her parents safe, and now it seems she must sacrifice her future to keep the rest of humanity safe, too. Ambrosia could be the key to harnessing her visions&amp;mdash; or it could cost her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;War is coming. The threshold between worlds has never been more fragile. Callie must discover who is pulling Zeus&amp;#39;s strings and avert the final battle&amp;mdash;before the immortal vying to become the next Supreme Deity kills her first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
