  <title>The Lost Lands of Reljae - Jeremy Bechen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the world of Akris, the race called humans are out of control. With their populations growing to horrifying numbers and their disregard for anything save for themselves has caused the other races to become dangerous to any creature. Alliances are sparse and trust near extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the west there is a disturbance in the Argoth Mountains. Here genocide rains rampant over the races of the mountain. No neutral or good race goes untouched by the evil storm that is about to roll across the world, leaving no land untouched by its wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entity named Darien Albringer leads a party in an attempt to find the lost lands of Reljae, and a way to save Akris, while the rest of the world defends themselves against an all consuming army of evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the war wages on, some of the gods of old join the scene as do creatures unknown to Akris. Deadly warriors of Alanon reach Relkin shores and beings worlds away are recruited as the war threatens to eliminate all life on Akris. This would be the first of many worlds which will feel the might of the evil tyrant&#39;s touch should it be victorious and loosened upon the universe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
