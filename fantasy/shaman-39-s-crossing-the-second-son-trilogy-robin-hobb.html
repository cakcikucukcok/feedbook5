  <title>Shaman&#39;s Crossing: The Second Son Trilogy - Robin Hobb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nevare Burvelle is the second son of a second son, destined from birth to carry a sword. The wealthy young noble will follow his father&amp;#8212;newly made a lord by the King of Gernia&amp;#8212;into the cavalry, training in the military arts at the elite King&#39;s Cavella Academy in the capital city of Old Thares. Bright and well-educated, an excellent horseman with an advantageous engagement, Nevare&#39;s future appears golden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as his Academy instruction progresses, Nevare begins to realize that the road before him is far from straight. The old aristocracy looks down on him as the son of a &quot;new noble&quot; and, unprepared for the political and social maneuvering of the deeply competitive school and city, the young man finds himself entangled in a web of injustice, discrimination, and foul play. In addition, he is disquieted by his unconventional girl-cousin Epiny&amp;#8212;who challenges his heretofore unwavering world view&amp;#8212;and by the bizarre dreams that haunt his nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For twenty years the King&#39;s cavalry has pushed across the grasslands, subduing and settling its nomads and claiming the territory in Gernia&#39;s name. Now they have driven as far as the Barrier Mountains, home to the Speck people, a quiet, forest-dwelling folk who retain the last vestiges of magic in a world that is rapidly becoming modernized. From childhood Nevare has been taught that the Specks are a primitive people to be pitied for their backward ways&amp;#8212;and feared for their indigenous diseases, including the deadly Speck plague, which has ravaged the frontier towns and military outposts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dark Evening brings the carnival to Old Thares, and with it an unknown magic, and the first Specks Nevare has ever seen . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
