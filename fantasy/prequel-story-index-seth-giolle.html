  <title>Prequel Story Index - Seth Giolle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an index for my Prequel Stories series. History tells of an age when the world knew true calm. It was ruled by a good True King Ellor, and dragons filled the skies with all their colourful wonder. But darkness blossomed and flourished. 	An evil wizard known as Auk Tria Yus crafted three magical blades and brought on the world&#39;s first Darkening that burned the skies and spawned legions of dark wizard armies that preyed on the innocent. 	Grio.dyness rose to power with his barbarian clan known as the Wolf. His barbarians met True King Ellor&#39;s armies on the wasteland around what would later be his castle stronghold.  	There are other legends of those times: a man who could summon gold and built a city of wealth. There&#39;s the tale of the fall of Sheava, a town and castle that equalled the True King&#39;s castle. 	This index documents the behind the scenes work involved in bringing those tales and times to life!" />
