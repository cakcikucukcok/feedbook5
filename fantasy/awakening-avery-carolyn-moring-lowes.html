  <title>Awakening Avery - Carolyn Moring Lowes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Avery was there to pick up the pieces of her best friends heart when Hannahs innocence was pillaged. To gain back their independence, the girls go on a forbidden adventure to the big city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, as if by coincidence, Avery meets another, far-from-creepy individual., tall, dark, and handsome, who sweeps her off her sensibly shoed feet at first sight. He turns out to be incredibly romantic, sensitive, and richalmost too perfect. Their relationship flourishes quickly, and it feels so right to Avery: true, undying, passionate love. This normally sensible, average teenager has unwittingly embarked on a mystical journey with her newfound love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She finds herself learning many strange, unimaginable but somehow familiar things With good comes bad. To know the light, there must be dark; To know extreme love, you must also feel pain. And with truth comes secretsdangerous, dark secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Avery, the world seems to be spiraling into a deep chasm of despair and fear. A fearful shroud of deception bewilders society. With Kaysens help, Avery learns what is on the other side of this unapparent cloak. These young lovers are an intrinsic part of a bigger, lighter picture and must awaken their supernatural gifts to save themselves and the others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
