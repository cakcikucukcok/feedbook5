  <title>The Purple Sky Book Two - Peter Anthony Barbieri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Peter Barbieris final novel in his trilogy continues with EMILY MADDINGs journal; in it, Emily documents PALE-MOONs narration of life in her [Pale-Moon] ninth-century Native American village. Pale-Moons connection to Emily, a woman living in the nineteenth century, enables the two women to dream-travel to each others time-band. Thus begins a celestial relationship that endures for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily frequently dream-travels to the ninth-century village and is present during the birth and much of the subsequent twenty-year life of Pale-Moons nephew TEH-GHUT-SA. The narration recounts the periods during which Teh-Ghut-Sa undertakes two vision quests: the first at age thirteen; the second at age twenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As events unfold, an imbalance in the interstellar positive-negative polarity develops. Emilyher ability to dream-travel to time-bands within the past, present, and futurereveals several possibilities that would result if the balance tips in favor of the negative polarity. If the imbalance were to progress unaltered, mayhem and death would result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Teh-Ghut-Sa, age twenty, returns from his second vision quest, he becomes the target of a negative-polarity plot. The confrontation&#39;s eventual outcome will affect the lives of all beings residing in the known universe. A more immediate consequence: the stream of consciousness that had given rise to the mind-consciousness of many village inhabitants would be obliterated, along with the lives of those connected to it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
