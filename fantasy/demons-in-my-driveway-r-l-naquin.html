Actually, she&amp;#39;s being dropkicked onto the front lines of a fight between the newly formed Cult of Imagination and Hidden governments everywhere.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;The Cult is opening portals and unleashing demons, vampires and werewolves, growing closer to breaking the lock that holds back the zombie apocalypse with every world they crack open. Oh, and they want every last Aegis in the world dead, and a roving band of Hidden worshippers is only too eager to assist.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;On the upside, Zoey finally has her mother back. But having another Aegis around&amp;#151;one with very different ideas on how to run things&amp;#151;is proving difficult. For their own safety, they&amp;#39;re stuck inside Zoey&amp;#39;s home. What was once a haven is now a prison, further straining maternal relations and alienating her reaper boyfriend. Taking down a cult and saving the world&amp;#151;again&amp;#151;would be a lot easier if she could go farther than her own driveway." />
