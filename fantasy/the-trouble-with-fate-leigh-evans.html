  <title>The Trouble with Fate - Leigh Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trouble with Fate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leigh Evans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Hedi Peacock and I have a secret. I&#39;m not human, and I have the pointy Fae ears and Were inner-bitch to prove it. As fairy tales go, my childhood was damn near perfect, all fur and magic until a werewolf killed my father and the Fae executed my mother. I&#39;ve never forgiven either side. Especially Robson Trowbridge. He was a part-time werewolf, a full-time bastard, and the first and only boy I ever loved. That is, until he became the prime suspect in my father&#39;s death...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I&#39;m a half-breed barista working at a fancy coffee house, living with my loopy Aunt Lou and a temperamental amulet named Merry, and wondering where in the world I&#39;m going in life. A pretty normal existence, considering. But when a pack of Weres decides to kidnap my aunt and force me to steal &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; amulet, the only one who can help me is the last person I ever thought I&#39;d turn to: Robson Trowbridge. And he&#39;s as annoyingly beautiful as I remember. That&#39;s the trouble with fate: Sometimes it barks. Other times it bites. And the rest of the time it just breaks your heart. Again...&lt;/p&gt;" />
