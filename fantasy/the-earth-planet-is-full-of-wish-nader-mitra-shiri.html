  <title>The Earth Planet Is Full of Wish - Nader, Mitra Shiri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vicki, who was born at the same time of lighting the Barcelona Summer Olympic&lt;br&gt;
Cauldron, considers herself as an original Olympic Child.&lt;br&gt;
She lives with her family in a home above a bookshop where her father and grandpa work;&lt;br&gt;
they are fond of books avidly while Vicki thinks reading book is a boring work and prefers&lt;br&gt;
sport to book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wishes to obtain the gold medal of the Olympics in diving.&lt;br&gt;
Vicki travels to Athens as a tourist for watching the 2004 Summer Olympic Games with&lt;br&gt;
her mother, who is a sport journalist, and during this trip she unwillingly starts reading a&lt;br&gt;
book; a book that by reading it her brother is going to reveal a mysterious secret for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vicki reads the book in the hope of finding her brothers secret, while she doesnt&lt;br&gt;
know that reading this book produces great changes in her life and involves her in new&lt;br&gt;
adventures, the adventures that carry her to a fantasy world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;" />
