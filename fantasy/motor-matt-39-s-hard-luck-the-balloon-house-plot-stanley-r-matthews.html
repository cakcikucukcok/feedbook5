      <meta name="description" content="MOTOR STORIES - THRILLING ADVENTURE MOTOR FICTION.&lt;br /&gt;
Characters that appear in this story:&lt;br /&gt;
Matt King: concerning whom there has always been a mystery&amp;mdash;a lad of splendid athletic abilities, and never-failing nerve, who has won for himself, among the boys of the Western town, the popular name of &amp;quot;Mile-a-minute Matt.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Carl Pretzel: a cheerful and rollicking German lad, who is led by a fortunate accident to hook up with Motor Matt in double harness.&lt;br /&gt;
Dick Ferral: a Canadian boy and a favorite of Uncle Jack; has served his time in the King&amp;#39;s navy, and bobs up in New Mexico where he falls into plots and counter-plots, and comes near losing his life.&lt;br /&gt;
Helen Brady:Hector Brady&amp;#39;s daughter, who helps Motor Matt.&lt;br /&gt;
Hector Brady: a rival inventor who has stolen his ideas from Hamilton Jerrold. His air ship is called the Hawk and is used for criminal purposes. Brady&amp;#39;s attempt to secure Motor Matt&amp;#39;s services as driver of the Hawk brings about the undoing of the criminal gang.&lt;br /&gt;
Hamilton Jerrold: an honest inventor who has devoted his life to a&amp;euml;ronautics, and who has built a successful air ship called the Eagle.&lt;br /&gt;
Jameson: a rich member of the A&amp;euml;ro Club, who thinks of buying the Hawk.&lt;br /&gt;
Whipple, Pete, Grove, Harper: members of Brady&amp;#39;s gang who carried out the &amp;quot;balloon-house plot,&amp;quot; which nearly resulted in a tragedy, and finally proved the complete undoing of Hector Brady.&lt;br /&gt;
Ochiltree: an ex-convict whose past record nearly got him into trouble.&lt;br /&gt;
Harris: a policeman of South Chicago who aids Motor Matt in his work against the Bradys.&lt;br /&gt;
Dennison and Twitchell: police officers of Grand Haven, Michigan, who take a part in the final capture of Brady." />
