  <title>The Clock - James Leslie Payne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the mid 1700s in Edinburgh until today  &lt;i&gt;The Clock &lt;/i&gt;winds its way through time and tides. Through the centuries it stands, a sentinel in many a home, some grand, some not so grand. Always it stands and keeps time for the owner. It keeps watch in more ways than one. Some owners are proud of the clock and keep it front and center, while others are ambivalent towards it and hardly notice its presence. Still it ticks and tocks its way through the ocean of time that two centuries avail. It was built as a pass into the Hammermen Society of Edinburgh; the boy genius craftsman that gave it birth could never have imagined the journey it went on  neither can you!&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many stories boast truth. They describe themselves as based on a real-life incident. The story of the clock is indeed is based on a very true story.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author James Leslie Payne is a broadcast executive in radio and television. He lives on Canadas West Coast with his wife, a golden retriever named Billy, and the Sentinelyes, the Sentinel. It turns out thats the latest stop on its incredible journeyone that Payne is eager to share with you.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn your collar to the cold winds of time; lets begin the journey of &lt;i&gt;The Clock&lt;/i&gt;.
