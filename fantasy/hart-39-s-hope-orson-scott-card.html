  <title>Hart&#39;s Hope - Orson Scott Card</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A dark and powerful fantasy from Orson Scott Card, the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Ender&#39;s Shadow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the city of Hart&#39;s Hope, ruled by gods both powerful and indifferent, riddled with sorcery and revenge. The city was captured by a rebellious lord, Palicrovol, who overthrew the cruel king, Nasilee, hated by his people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palicrovol, too, was cruel, as befitted a king. He took the true mantle of kinghood by forcing Asineth, now Queen by her father&#39;s death, to marry him, raping her to consummate the marriage. [But he was not cruel enough to rule.] He let her live after her humiliation; live to bear a daughter; live to return from exile and retake the throne of Hart&#39;s Hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she, in turn, sent Palicrovol into exile to breed a son who would, in the name of the God, take back the kingdom from its cruel Queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Meandering at times, but tied together quite beautifully at its close, “Hart’s Hope” weaves its own entirely new, yet nostalgic folktale.<br /><b><i>Hart's Hope by Orson Scott Card - Goodreads</i></b> | Hart's Hope takes place in a realm called Burland in the midst of its medieval ages. Like many fantasies , magic is a real and functional force in this story's world, but with a grisly twist: all magic, whatever its purpose, must be paid for in blood.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Hart&#39;s Hope - Orson Scott Card</a> </h3></p><hr/>
