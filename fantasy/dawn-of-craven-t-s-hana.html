  <title>Dawn of Craven - T.S. Hana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Axel Craven is an alchemist, an intelligent man who brings the elements of science and magic together to create wonders the human eye couldn&#39;t possibly fathom. His life, however, is not so wonderful. After the murder of his parents and the loss of his master, the twenty-five year old has become a vengeful, cold man who barely knows himself anymore let alone the people around him and the past he&#39;s left behind.
But his time of quiet loathing comes to an end when a little girl appears on his doorstep. And she asks him --of all people --for help. The adventure that follows will change their lives --and many others --forever." />
