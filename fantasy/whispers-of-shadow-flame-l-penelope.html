  <title>Whispers of Shadow &amp; Flame - L. Penelope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Mantle that separates the kingdoms of Elsira and Lagrimar is about to fall. And life will drastically change for both kingdoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born with a deadly magic she cannot control, Kyara is forced to become an assassin. Known as the Poison Flame in the kingdom of Lagrimar, she is notorious and lethal, but secretly seeks freedom from both her untamed power and the blood spell that commands her. She is tasked with capturing the legendary rebel called the Shadowfox, but everything changes when she learns her target&#39;s true identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darvyn ol-Tahlyro may be the most powerful Earthsinger in generations, but guilt over those he couldn&#39;t save tortures him daily. He isn&#39;t sure he can trust the mysterious young woman who claims to need his help, but when he discovers Kyara can unlock the secrets of his past, he can&#39;t stay away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyara and Darvyn grapple with betrayal, old promises, and older prophecies--all while trying to stop a war. And when a new threat emerges, they must beat the odds to save both kingdoms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
