  <title>Playing to the Gods - Melanie Rawn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this fifth book final volume of the acclaimed series Glass Thorns, Melanie Rawn has created a superb high fantasy series that blends the worlds of magic, theater, art, and politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boys are at the top of their theatrical game. Their only real competition for the hearts and gold of the public are the Shadowshapers. Nevertheless, the past years of financial struggle, since their manager proved to have been embezzling, have taken a toll on the group&#39;s creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shocking event brings all that to an end and brings Touchstone back together to create a play that will rattle the ceilings and shatter all the glass in palaces and theaters alike. An ancient conflict will come to a violent conclusion on stage, and all the gods will be watching.&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Glass Thorns Series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;#1 Touchstone&lt;br&gt;#2 Elsewhens&lt;br&gt;#3 Thornlost&lt;br&gt;#4 Window Wall&lt;br&gt;#5 Playing to the Gods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
