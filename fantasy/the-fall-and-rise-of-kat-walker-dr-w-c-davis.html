  <title>The Fall and Rise of Kat Walker - Dr. W. C. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="HOW DID THIS BOOK COME ABOUT? About ten years
ago I sustained a series of downward turns during which I lost
everything I considered vital to my existence. In the end, I came
to realize, what Id really lost was me. So I began to write daily
journals to help myself heal.
Early in my recovery, I had a dream about two celestial creatures,
Beast and Priest, who decided to play The Game to decide which
of them would control all mens souls, including my own. Never
did I imagine those first few sentences I wrote in my journal the
morning after my dream would result in a two volume book which
documented the journey of a tortured soul named Kat Walker into
the Great Abyss and beyond. When his courage proved to all his
heart was pure again, he got one last chance at life.
Kat Walker and I completed this book together to prove to all who
enter its pages there is always hope if you believe in the power of
love and that miracles are real." />
