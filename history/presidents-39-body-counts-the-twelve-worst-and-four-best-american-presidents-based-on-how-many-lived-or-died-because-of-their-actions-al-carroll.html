  <title>Presidents&#39; Body Counts: The Twelve Worst and Four Best American Presidents Based on How Many Lived or Died Because of Their Actions - Al Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Endorsed by the Thom Hartmann Show! Over 1000 downloads! Most rankings of presidents are popularity contests based on most recognized or best liked based on the political bias of the judges.  This book abandons all partisan nonsense for the only ranking that matters a humanitarian one: Who were our best and worst presidents, based on how many lived or died because of their actions?  Twelves presidents were our worst, guilty of crimes as serious as genocide or wars of aggression. Many ignored genocide or terrorism, or were so incompetent or blinded by politics, that sometimes millions died.  Four presidents, each strongly despised by many, were actually our best presidents, saving millions of lives, defending human rights, and preventing wars.
