  <title>Return to Killybegs - Sorj Chalandon, Ursula Meany Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tyrone Meehan, damned as an informer, ekes out his days in Donegal, awaiting his killers. Now that everything is out in the open, they will all speak in my place – the ira, the British, my family, my close friends, journalists I&#39;ve never even met. Some of them will go so far as to explain how and why I ended up a traitor ... Do not trust my enemies, and even less my friends. Ignore those who will say they knew me. Nobody has ever walked in my shoes, nobody. The only reason&#39;I&#39;m talking today is because I am the only one who can tell the truth. Because after I&#39;m gone, I hope for silence. Return to Killybegs is the story of a traitor to Belfast&#39;s Catholic community, emerging from the white heat of a prolonged war during the 197os and 198os in Northern Ireland. This powerful work, lauded by critics, shortlisted for the Prix Goncourt and awarded the Grand Prix de Roman de l&#39;Académie Française, deals with a subject that touches a nerve for most Irish people: the all- too-human circumstances of betrayal and survival. It is an extraordinary read. Sorj Chalandon is a novelist who spent formative years on assignment in Northern Ireland as a reporter for Libération during the Troubles. He is the author of two works: My Traitor was first published to acclaim in France in 2007 and winner of the Prix Joseph Kessel and the Prix Jean Freustié. Return to Killybegs was originally published in France in 2011." />
