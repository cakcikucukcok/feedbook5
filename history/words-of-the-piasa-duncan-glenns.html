  <title>Words of the Piasa - Duncan Glenns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine yourself being the powerful, magical and now legendary creature which has been recognized world-wide throughout history as most likely the most powerful being whom has ever existed. Used to being the top of the food chain and even having had dominion over these upstart human beings for all of the time which they have called Mother Earth  their home. You have seen many of their kind make somewhat valiant attempts at the creation of a life that would be in tune with that of the &quot;mother&quot; within this world for innumerable of their lifetimes, only to see them fail at every important crossroad with which they were faced. Now imagine that you have seen these humans remove most of the Magic  from the world that you love and have called home for time longer than they can even begin to realize how to measure and that they are causing the ending of the existence of many of the beings that have existed here since times untold, who were all vessels which truly contained the strong essence of the old magic that was once so fully saturated this lovely world, but their advancements and the Technology  of which they were so very capable of creating had now begun to unchangeably, possibly negatively alter the world which you had called home for such a very, very long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet imagine as well, that you the Piasa, possibly the last of dragon kind had discovered within these humans, something that was quite possibly some new sort of Magic one which you had never seen before, called love; which at first you had been unfamiliar with, but now that you had experienced it through relationships with several of these unique beings felt that it was the one and only hope for us all?&lt;/p&gt;" />
