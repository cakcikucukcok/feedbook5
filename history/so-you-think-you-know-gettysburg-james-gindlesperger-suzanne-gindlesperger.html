  <title>So You Think You Know Gettysburg? - James Gindlesperger, Suzanne Gindlesperger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you didn’t sleep through U.S. history class, you’ve heard of Pickett’s Charge. If you’ve seen the movie Gettysburg, you’re familiar with Little Round Top. If you’ve been to the battlefield, you’ve seen the Wheatfield. But do you know about the ten or so Confederates buried by accident in Gettysburg National Cemetery? Or about the Union general whose embezzling ways kept his bust from being displayed on his brigade’s memorial? Or how that same embezzling general, when asked why he had no monument at Gettysburg, could rightly reply, “Why, hell, the whole battlefield is my monument”? Authors James and Suzanne Gindlesperger have visited Gettysburg an average of five times annually over the past twenty years. So You Think You Know Gettysburg? shows why they find it a place not only of horrible carnage and remarkable bravery but endless fascination. Who, or what, was Penelope? Whose dog is depicted on the Eleventh Pennsylvania Monument, and why? What are the Curious Rocks? Why does Gettysburg have two markers for the battle’s first shot, and why are they in different locations? The plentiful maps, the nearly 200 site descriptions, and the 270-plus color photos in So You Think You Know Gettysburg? will answer questions you didn’t even know you had about America’s greatest battlefield." />
