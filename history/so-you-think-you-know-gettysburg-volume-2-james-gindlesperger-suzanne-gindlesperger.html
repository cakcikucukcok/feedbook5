  <title>So You Think You Know Gettysburg? Volume 2 - James Gindlesperger, Suzanne Gindlesperger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nearly two million people visit Gettysburg National Military Park annually, but most of those visitors possess only a rudimentary knowledge of the battle and restrict their travel to the well-established tourist routes. Few know the stories behind the monuments that dot the battlefield, but those back stories are often as fascinating as the story of the battle itself.In their award-winning So You Think You Know Gettysburg?, the Gindlespergers had to make difficult decisions when deciding which of the 200 sites out of the 1,300 battlefield monuments to include. At their frequent book signings in Gettysburg, customers were asking them for a second volume so visitors could learn even more about the monuments throughout the park.In So You Think You Know Gettysburg? Volume Two, the Gindlespergers have expounded on the histories of an additional 200+ park attractions. The area maps and 270+ color photographs make this guide a welcome addition for the park visitor or the armchair traveler." />
