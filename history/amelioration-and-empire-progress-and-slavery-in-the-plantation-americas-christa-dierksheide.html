  <title>Amelioration and Empire: Progress and Slavery in the Plantation Americas - Christa Dierksheide</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christa Dierksheide argues that &quot;enlightened&quot; slaveowners in     the British Caribbean and the American South, neither backward reactionaries nor freedom-loving     hypocrites, thought of themselves as modern, cosmopolitan men with a powerful alternative vision     of progress in the Atlantic world. Instead of radical revolution and liberty, they believed that     amelioration-defined by them as gradual progress through the mitigation of social or political     evils such as slavery-was the best means of driving the development and expansion of New World     societies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interrogating amelioration as an intellectual concept among     slaveowners, Dierksheide uses a transnational approach that focuses on provincial planters     rather than metropolitan abolitionists, shedding new light on the practice of slavery in the     Anglophone Atlantic world. She argues that amelioration-of slavery and provincial society more     generally-was a dominant concept shared by enlightened planters who sought to &quot;improve&quot; slavery     toward its abolition, as well as by those who sought to ameliorate the institution in order to     expand the system. By illuminating the common ground shared between supposedly anti- and     pro-slavery provincials, she provides a powerful alternative to the usual story of liberal     progress in the plantation Americas. Amelioration, she demonstrates, went well beyond the     master-slave relationship, underpinning Anglo-American imperial expansion throughout the     Atlantic world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
