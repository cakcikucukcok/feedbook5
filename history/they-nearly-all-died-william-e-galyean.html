  <title>They Nearly All Died - William E. Galyean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ten young men from a small Indiana town volunteer to take up arms against the Confederates as war breaks out between North and South.
The men will prove their mettle as part of Company K of the Nineteenth Volunteer Regiment, part of the Union Army of the Potomacs Iron Brigade. Known as fierce fighters, the brigade will suffer some of the heaviest casualties during the Civil War.
They will fight important battles over three years, including Second Bull Run, South Mountain, Antietam, Gettysburg, Fredericksburg, and the battle of the Wilderness. Their actions will help determine the fate of a nation.
This in-depth history explores what divided North and South, why disease was more dangerous than enemy soldiers, and what actions were taken on a daily basis to survive, touching on key generals and political figures.
Primary documents, including letters written by soldiers, provide insights into how the war progressed. Discover what it meant to be a Union soldier in &lt;i&gt;They Nearly All Died.&lt;/i&gt;" />
