  <title>Lists of Note - Shaun Usher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Humans have been making lists for even longer than they&#39;ve been writing letters. They are the shorthand for what really matters to us: our hopes and aspirations; likes and dislikes; rules for living and loving; records of our memories and reminders of the things we want to do before we die. Just as he did with Letters of Note, Shaun Usher has trawled the world&#39;s archives to produce a rich visual anthology that stretches from ancient times to present day. From a to-do list of Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s to Charles Darwin on the pros and cons of marriage or Julia Child&#39;s list of possible titles for what would later become an American cooking bible, Lists of Note is a constantly surprising A-Z of what makes us human. In its pages you&#39;ll find 125 lists with facsimiles or illustrations, including:  1. A shopping list written by two 9th-century Tibetan monks 2. A handwritten list of the BFG&#39;s favourite words by Roald Dahl 3. The 19 year-old Isaac Newton&#39;s list of the 57 sins he&#39;d already committed 4. Galileo&#39;s list of parts needed to build his telescope 5. Einstein&#39;s punitive list of conditions imposed on his first wife 6. 29-year-old Marilyn Monroe&#39;s inspirational set of New Year&#39;s resolutions 7. Martin Luther King&#39;s advice for black people starting to use buses 8. Johnny Cash&#39;s list of &#39;things to do today&#39; 9. Michelangelo&#39;s illustrated shopping list 10. Advice for &#39;chick rockers&#39; by Chrissie Hynde  And many, many more..." />
