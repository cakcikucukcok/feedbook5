  <title>Patience Romford’S Journal - Helene-Carol Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="General John Sullivan was in control of many things. The weather was not one of them. Neither was the Comte dEstaing. He was the French admiral in charge of the fleet sent to aid General Sullivan in retaking Newport, Rhode Island, from the British. No one questioned General Sullivans bravery. A goodly number questioned his diplomacy. 
The Great Storm, which arrived in August of 1778, wrought destruction on the tents, food, and ammunition that American troops under General Sullivan had amassed upon Aquidneck Island in the middle of Narragansett Bay. The Americans were left stranded without the help of the French fleet, whose ships were nearly destroyed in the huge tempest. 
General Nathanael Greene and General James Varnum brought Continentals to the campaign to ensure its success. Nearly overwhelmed by the British and the Hessians, the Americans were saved by the First Rhode Island Regiment of all black soldiers who held out against the enemy. Local militia in small boats rowed the Patriots to safety across the Sakonnet River. 
One wounded Continental soldier was of particular interest to the capable and enterprising Patience Romford. One wounded black soldier in the First Rhode Island Regiment was of particular interest to Betsy, an African woman in bondage. Would either young man return to Providence Town alive after such a disastrous misadventure as the Battle for Rhode Island?" />
