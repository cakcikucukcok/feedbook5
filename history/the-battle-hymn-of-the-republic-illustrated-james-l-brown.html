  <title>The Battle Hymn of the Republic Illustrated - James L. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What could inspire thousands to march off, and possibly die, to reunite our nation during the Civil War?  Julia Ward Howe answered that question with a passionate fervor when she wrote The Battle Hymn of the Republic, which was inspired by the music of John Browns Body along with the tumultuous events that divided a nation torn apart by slavery. This illustrated book not only includes the songs wonderful lyrics but also images of the people who inspired them and fought for justice, equality, and unity: abolitionists John Brown and Frederick Douglass, President Abraham Lincoln, common soldiers, and Ward Howe herself. The words of the hymn are just as resonant today as they were back then: We continue to witness struggles that are deeply inspired by the abiding faith that come through loud and clear in the hymns final verse: Glory, glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah! Our God is marching on.&lt;/p&gt;" />
