  <title>Forgotten Land - Max Egremont</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Until the end of World War II, East Prussia was the German empire&#39;s farthest eastern redoubt, a thriving and beautiful land on the southeastern coast of the Baltic Sea. Now it lives only in history and in myth. Since 1945, the territory has been divided between Poland and Russia, stretching from the border between Russia and Lithuania in the east and south, and through Poland in the west. In &lt;i&gt;Forgotten&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Land&lt;/i&gt;, Max Egremont offers a vivid account of this region and its people through the stories of individuals who were intimately involved in and transformed by its tumultuous history, as well as accounts of his own travels and interviews he conducted along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forgotten Land&lt;/i&gt; is a story of historical identity and character, told through intimate portraits of people and places. It is a unique examination of the layers of history, of the changing perceptions and myths of homeland, of virtue and of wickedness, and of how a place can still overwhelm those who left it years before.&lt;/p&gt;" />
