  <title>The Human Tradition in Texas - Ty Cashion, de la Jesus F. Teja</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The rich and unique history of the &#39;Lone Star State&#39; is presented in this new book through the lives of a variety of Texans who put a human face on the state&#39;s history. Biographical sketches of fifteen famous and little-known men and women of different colors, religions, and economic backgrounds offer new insight into the history of the state.&lt;p&gt; Starting in the sixteenth century with Alvar N?Òez Cabeza de Vaca, the first European to make contact with Texas Indian tribes, and tracing Texas history to the late twentieth century with a final sketch of Gary Gaines, a high-school football coach, &lt;i&gt;The Human Tradition in Texas&lt;/i&gt; brings the state&#39;s history to life by showing real people and the events and times in which they lived.&lt;/p&gt; Written by leading and rising scholars of Texas history, this book presents the major themes and periods in Texas history, including the settling of Anglo-Americans in the region, bringing an American democ-racy that supported slavery; the Civil War and Reconstruction; technologi-cal developments in the late nineteenth century, including railroads and irrigation for crops and livestock; Texas&#39;s transformation in the early twentieth century from a world of cotton and cattle to a world of paved streets, electricity and running water; the challenges to modernization faced by the state with the development of the oil industry, the growth in industrialization, and the increasing size of Texas&#39;s cities; the new age, with Texas taking leadership roles in the oil, aviation, and entertainment industries; and the expanding inclusiveness of Texas society, nowhere more complete than on the sports field-particularly the football field.&lt;p&gt; A collection of accessible and entertaining essays on this vast, vibrant state, The &lt;i&gt;Human Tradition in Texas&lt;/i&gt; is an excellent resource for courses in Texas history and the history of the American West.&lt;/p&gt;" />
