  <title>Hana&#39;s Suitcase - Karen Levine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In March 2000, a suitcase arrived at a children&#39;s Holocaust education center in Tokyo, Japan from the Auschwitz museum in Germany. Fumiko Ishioka, the center&#39;s curator, was captivated by the writing on the outside that identified its owner: &quot;Hana Brady, May 16, 1931, Waisenkind (the German word for orphan).&quot; Children visiting the center were full of questions. Who was Hana Brady? Where did she come from? What was she like? What happened to her? Inspired by their curiosity and her own need to know, Fumiko began a year of detective work, scouring the world for clues.  Her search led her from present-day Japan, Europe and North America back to 1938 Czechoslovakia to learn the story of Hana Brady, a fun-loving child with wonderful parents, a protective big brother, and a passion for ice skating, their happy life turned upside down by the invasion of the Nazis." />
