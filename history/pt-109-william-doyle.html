  <title>PT 109 - William Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The extraordinary World War II story of shipwreck and survival that paved John F. Kennedy&amp;#39;s path to power &amp;#8211; hailed as a &amp;#8220;breathtaking account&amp;#8221; by James Patterson, &amp;#8220;masterfully written&amp;#8221; by historian Douglas Brinkley, and &amp;#8220;the finest book&amp;#8221; ever written on the subject by Lt. Commander William Liebenow, the man who rescued JFK and the PT 109 crew in August 1943.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early morning darkness of August 2, 1943, during a chaotic nighttime skirmish amid the Solomon Islands, the Japanese destroyer&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Amagiri&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;barreled through thick fog and struck the U.S. Navy&amp;#39;s motor torpedo boat PT 109, splitting the craft nearly in half and killing two American sailors instantly. The sea erupted in flames as the 109&amp;#39;s skipper, John F. Kennedy, and the ten surviving crewmen under his command desperately clung to the sinking wreckage; 1,200 feet of ink-black, shark-infested water loomed beneath. &amp;#34;All hands lost,&amp;#34; came the reports back to the Americans&amp;#39; base: no rescue was coming for the men of PT 109. Their desperate ordeal was just beginning&amp;#8212;so too was one of the most remarkable tales of World War II, one whose astonishing afterlife would culminate two decades later in the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on original interviews with the last living links to the events, previously untapped Japanese wartime archives, and a wealth of archival documents from the Kennedy Library, including a lost first-hand account by JFK himself, bestselling author William Doyle has crafted a thrilling and definitive account of the sinking of PT 109 and its shipwrecked crew&amp;#39;s heroics. Equally fascinating is the story&amp;#39;s second act, in which Doyle explores in new detail how this extraordinary episode shaped Kennedy&amp;#39;s character and fate, proving instrumental to achieving his presidential ambitions: &amp;#34;Without PT 109, there never would have been a President John F. Kennedy,&amp;#34; declared JFK aide David Powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring castaways on a deserted island, a spy network of Solomon Island natives, an Australian coast watcher hidden on the side of a volcano, an S.O.S. note carved into a coconut, and a daring rescue attempt led by Kennedy&amp;#39;s fellow American PT boats,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;PT 109&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is an unforgettable American epic of war and destiny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
