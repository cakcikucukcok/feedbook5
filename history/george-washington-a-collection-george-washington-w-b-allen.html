  <title>George Washington: A Collection - George Washington, W. B. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;George Washington: A Collection&lt;/B&gt; is an important addition to the literature on the American Revolution. The book provides a splendid introduction to Washington and his political beliefs, to the events of the Revolution through which he lived, and to the eighteenth-century world.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;#8212;Pauline Maier, Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;George Washington speaks for himself on behalf of liberty and the emerging American republic in this handsome book, the only one-volume compilation in print of his vast writings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While every American recognizes Washington as a military leader and the great symbolic figure of the early republic, many fail to appreciate the full measure of Washington&#39;s contributions to the country. In these selections, his political ideas and judgments stand out with remarkable clarity. His writings are replete with sustained, thoughtful commentary. Washington must now be acknowledged as a man of keen political insight as well as a national hero.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Drawing extensively on his correspondence, this volume also includes all of his presidential addresses, various public proclamations, his last will and testament, and the most comprehensive recompilation of the &quot;discarded first inaugural&quot; ever printed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;W. B. Allen&lt;/B&gt; is&amp;#160;Professor of Political Philosophy and Director of the Program in Public Policy and Administration at Michigan State University.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
