  <title>John Wilkes Booth &amp; Robert Lincoln - Rivals? - James L. Barbour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reprinted in its entirety, is the fascinating tale of jealous rivalry for the affections of the beautiful socialite, (Lucy) Bessie Hale - her suitors being none other than John Wilkes Booth and Robert Lincoln, son of President Abraham Lincoln - the date being 1865 in the days leading up to the President&#39;s assassination. The eye-witness account is that of a Mrs. Temple, who lived at the National Hotel with the Hale family and Bessie, and who was also a friend to both Booth and Lincoln. She provided the account to Alexander Hunter who later published it in 1878 in a Chicago newspaper, the Daily Inter-Ocean. Barbour brings this absorbing story to light once more in this reprint and adds supplemental material in his &quot;After Notes.&quot; As he states, &quot;Many theories have been advanced concerning Booth&#39;s motives for assassinating President Lincoln. This story provides yet another.&quot;" />
