      <meta name="description" content="Carmel-by-the-Sea, The Early Years (1903-1913) describes the establishment of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, along with an overview of the history of the Carmel Mission and the Monterey Peninsula. The books emphasis is on the development of Carmel as a Bohemian artists and writers colony at the start of the 20th century. The towns first decade of existence is described: the businesses and services offered, and the residential architecture. There are biographies of the well-known Bohemian artists, writers, poets, builders, and other notable residents and visitors in the early 1900s. This original group of settlers, the majority of whom came from Northern Californias Bay Area, were distinctive individuals, who were drawn to the coastal village by its scenic beauty and the inspiration it provided for their intellectual pursuits. They set the tone that made Carmel-by-the-Sea a Bohemian enclave on the West Coast, and distinguished it as a unique place. These early residents and visitors left a significant and lasting impact on the future of the seaside town, which in turn attracted other creative talents to the area, through the years and still to this day. Carmel-by-the-Sea, The Early Years (1903-1913), preserves the literary, artistic, cultural, and architectural heritage of Carmel and the Monterey Peninsula region." />
