  <title>Death and the Virgin Queen - Chris Skidmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;In the tradition of Alison Weir&#39;s &lt;/I&gt;New York Times &lt;I&gt;bestselling &lt;/I&gt;Mary, Queen of Scots and the Murder of Lord Darnley, &lt;I&gt;comes the most sensational crime story of Tudor England. &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;On the morning of September 8, 1560, at the isolated manor of Cunmor place, the body of a young woman was found at the bottom of a staircase, her neck broken. But this was no ordinary death. Amy Robsart was the wife of Elizabeth I&#39;s great favorite, Robert Dudley, the man who many believed she would marry, were he free. Immediately people suspected foul play and Elizabeth&#39;s own reputation was in danger of serious damage. Many felt she might even lose her throne. An inquest was begun, witnesses called, and ultimately a verdict of death by accident was reached. But the mystery refused to die and cast a long shadow over Elizabeth&#39;s reign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using recently discovered forensic evidence from the original investigation, Skidmore is able to put an end to centuries of speculation as to the true causes of Robsart&#39;s death. This is the story of a treacherous period in Elizabeth&#39;s life: a tale of love, death, and tragedy, exploring the dramatic early life of England&#39;s Virgin Queen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
