  <title>Gertie - Faye Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Divorce-a horrid seven letter word in 1914.
Gertie MacGregor, became the first and only
divorced woman in Laurel, Maryland. At
seventeen and in love with Edward Neal, her
world was roses and sunshine. She hoped
Edward would see the world as she did, but
after three years, her blinders were removed.
Edwards deep seeded anger ruled him. He
shattered her arm and the marriage. Society
expected her to make the best of it and keep
the marriage vows. She chose divorce.
Rejection-Words of condemnation rolled off
tongues at Gertie like hot bullets when she
was removed as soloist of the church choir.
Gazes were averted as she met friends and
neighbors. She was denied help in a time of
need, and lost her job when she stayed home
to care for her sick child. Her chosen path
was not accepted in small town America in
the early 1900s. She was ostracized and the
pitfalls were many as she struggled to raise
her son alone.
Gertie filled her life by serving veterans
at nearby Ft. Meade, through WWI and
WWII. She developed USO clubs and sat
at the bedsides of wounded heroes. WWII
changed womens place in the world. They
became part of the work force and raised
children alone. Eleanor Roosevelt officially
recognized Gerties service. She was redeemed
her in the eyes of her community.
Jesse Morgan partnered her in service to
veterans and brought love back into her life.
The beautiful winding staircase in Jesses
home was symbolic of her small steps to
some distant height. They walked in perfect
accord up the stairs to their future.
Courage-Gertie walked through life,
poignantly meeting the fears and hardships
of war, the devastation of loss and hatred,
and the joys and sorrows of love with the
grace of heroes." />
