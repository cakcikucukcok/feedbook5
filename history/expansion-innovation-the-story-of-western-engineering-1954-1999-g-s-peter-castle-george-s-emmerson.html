  <title>Expansion &amp; Innovation: The Story of Western Engineering 1954-1999 - G. S. Peter Castle, George S. Emmerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Western Engineering has earned an international reputation for conducting leading-edge research and offering university students unique learning opportunities. However, the faculty faced many challenges - and celebrated many successes - during its first 45 years. From starting as a department at The University of Western Ontario, to becoming a faculty with graduate programs and research centres and institutes, this history is brought to life through the memories of faculty members, staff and alumni who helped shape the faculty and build its reputation at the local, national and international level. The five academic leaders who guided the Faculty of Engineering Science through this period offered stability through challenging times and fiscal hardships, as well as adapted to societal needs. The growth of the faculty during the first 45 years is a credit to this leadership and the dedication of faculty and staff members, students and alumni." />
