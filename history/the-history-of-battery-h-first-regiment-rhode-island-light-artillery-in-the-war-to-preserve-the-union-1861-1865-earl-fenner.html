  <title>The History of Battery H First Regiment Rhode Island Light Artillery in the War to Preserve the Union 1861-1865 - Earl Fenner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;PREFACE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the 27th of June, 1891, a meeting of the surviving members of Battery H was called in the City of Providence, R. I., and the writer was appointed historian, and authorized and empowered to prepare a history of the battery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fully realizing the magnitude of such an undertaking, and making no pretense of special fitness for the task imposed upon him, yet he entered upon the work with a determination to make a faithful record of every event connected with the Battery so far as he was able to do with the materials at hand. From daily memoranda kept during the entire service of the Battery in the War for the Union, and from consultation with reliable works relating to the Rebellion, this history has been prepared, and to their aid the writer is greatly indebted for the accuracy of the work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He fully appreciates the kindly services rendered by Adjutant-General Elisha Dyer and his assistants, and valuable material furnished by Captain viHazard, Sergeant Cheever, Corporal Paul and others whose names are not mentioned here, and to whom he is under many obligations.&lt;br /&gt;
