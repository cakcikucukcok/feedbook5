  <title>To Win the Lost War - Lawrence Cambria</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Perhaps the most long overdue work ever written about World War II and Americas role in winning it. Bold, fresh, unique, extremely well documented, and brutally honest, in To Win the Lost War Lawrence Cambria examines and analyzes the war at numerous levels and spaced intervals in order to provide the reader with an ongoing assessment of the overall situation as the war progressed. He examines, analyzes, and compares the major turning points of the war in Europe in order to determine which has the best claim to being the decisive turning point. He also takes a fresh look at Americas war experience, bringing into focus numerous aspects of the war which are unknown to most Americans. Finally, he brings greater context to the importance of the American military effort.
With To Win the Lost War the author joins a growing number of contemporary scholars who are making many of the same observations that he has. In fact, his work draws on a bibliography of works from more than 200 scholars on the war and has more than 1,100 supporting footnotes. In To Win the Lost War Lawrence Cambria separates popular myth from reality and provides his readers with observations on the war from perspectives that many have never considered. Read To Win the Lost War. It will change the way you look at World War II forever." />
