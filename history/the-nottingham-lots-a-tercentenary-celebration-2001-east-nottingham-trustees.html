  <title>The Nottingham Lots: a Tercentenary Celebration 2001 - East Nottingham Trustees</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Nottingham Lots began in 1701 after William Penn was told by Lord Talbot of Maryland, that Pennsylvania could settle as far as the fall waters of the Susquehanna go down hill.  This area is now located in Northern Cecil County, Maryland and Southern Chester County, Pennsylvania.
This book is telling the history of the Nottingham Lots and the genealogy of each of the original sixteen settlers.  The Tercentenary celebration of the Nottingham Lots held in September 2001, at the Brick Meetinghouse in Calvert, Maryland, was a successful two day affair.  It is likely this was the first time the meetinghouse was crowded for nearly a century.&quot;" />
