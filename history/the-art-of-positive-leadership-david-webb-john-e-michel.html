  <title>The Art of Positive Leadership - David Webb, John E. Michel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nothing fully prepares one for service in a combat zone.  When I was selected to command the NATO Air Training Command Afghanistan and the 438th Air Expeditionary Wing in Kabul, I had almost a quarter century of uniformed service to prepare me for this dynamic assignment. Dynamic because the mission would be to develop an independent, self-sustaining Afghan Air Force  in an active war zone.  The book you hold in your hand is a collection of the most important lessons we learned. Lessons which anyone, be it a parent, pastor, politician, soldier, teacher, or office teammate, can use to begin transforming ordinary interactions into powerful, positive experiences. War zone not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was honored to have served with General Michel in Afghanistan and observed first hand true leadership in practice under the most difficult conditions - In the Art of Positive Leadership, General Michel has captured the essence of the leadership style and skill that made him so successful in a theater of war - he has used a unique blending of axioms and stories, born from the very best leaders, in an amazingly powerful message about the techniques and impact of leaders that unselfishly focus on what can be, what should be, and the people that actually make it happen ~ John Johns, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Maintenance)&lt;/p&gt;" />
