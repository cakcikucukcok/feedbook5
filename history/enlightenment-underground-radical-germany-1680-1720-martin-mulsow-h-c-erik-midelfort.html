  <title>Enlightenment Underground: Radical Germany, 1680-1720 - Martin Mulsow, H. C. Erik Midelfort</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Online supplement,&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a     href=&quot;http://history.as.virginia.edu/sites/history.as.virginia.edu/files/MulsowAdditionstoNotes3.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;&quot;Mulsow:     Additions to Notes drawn from the 2002 edition of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Moderne aus dem     Untergrund&quot;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: full versions of nearly 300 notes that were truncated in     the print edition. Hosted on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://history.virginia.edu/user/43&quot;&amp;gt;H. C. Erik     Midelfort&#39;s website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Martin Mulsow&amp;#8217;s seismic     reinterpretation of the origins of the Enlightenment in Germany won awards and renown in its     original German edition, and now H. C. Erik Midelfort&#39;s translation makes this sensational book     available to English-speaking readers. In &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Enlightenment Underground,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Mulsow     shows that even in the late seventeenth century some thinkers in Germany ventured to express     extremely dangerous ideas, but did so as part of a secret underground. Scouring manuscript     collections across northern Europe, Mulsow studied the writings of countless hitherto unknown     radical jurists, theologians, historians, and dissident students who pushed for the     secularization of legal, political, social, and religious knowledge. Often their works     circulated in manuscript, anonymously, or as clandestinely published books. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Working as a philosophical microhistorian, Mulsow has discovered the identities of     several covert radicals and linked them to circles of young German scholars, many of whom were     connected with the vibrant radical cultures of the Netherlands, England, and Denmark. The author     reveals how radical ideas and contributions to intellectual doubt came from Socinians and Jews,     church historians and biblical scholars, political theorists, and unemployed university     students. He shows that misreadings of humorous or ironic works sometimes gave rise to     unintended skeptical thoughts or corrosively political interpretations of Christianity. This     landmark book overturns stereotypical views of the early Enlightenment in Germany as cautious,     conservative, and moderate, and replaces them with a new portrait that reveals a movement far     more radical, unintended, and puzzling than previously suspected.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;" />
