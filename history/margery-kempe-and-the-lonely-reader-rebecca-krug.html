  <title>Margery Kempe and the Lonely Reader - Rebecca Krug</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since its rediscovery in 1934, the fifteenth-century &lt;em&gt;Book of Margery Kempe&lt;/em&gt; has become a canonical text for students of medieval Christian mysticism and spirituality. Its author was a fifteenth-century English laywoman who, after the birth of her first child, experienced vivid religious visions and vowed to lead a deeply religious life while remaining part of the secular world. After twenty years, Kempe began to compose with the help of scribes a book of consolation, a type of devotional writing found in late medieval religious culture that taught readers how to find spiritual comfort and how to feel about one&#39;s spiritual life. In &lt;em&gt;Margery Kempe and the Lonely Reader&lt;/em&gt;, Rebecca Krug shows how and why Kempe wrote her Book, arguing that in her engagement with written culture she discovered a desire to experience spiritual comfort and to interact with fellow believers who also sought to live lives of intense emotional engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unlikely candidate for authorship in the late medieval period given her gender and lack of formal education, Kempe wrote her &lt;em&gt;Book&lt;/em&gt; as a revisionary act. Krug shows how the &lt;em&gt;Book &lt;/em&gt;reinterprets concepts from late medieval devotional writing (comfort, despair, shame, fear, and loneliness) in its search to create a spiritual community that reaches out to and includes Kempe, her friends, family, advisers, and potential readers. Krug offers a fresh analysis of the &lt;em&gt;Book&lt;/em&gt; as a written work and draws attention to the importance of reading, revision, and collaboration for understanding both Kempe’s particular decision to write and the social conditions of late medieval women’s authorship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
