  <title>Dead and Gone - Manly Wade Wellman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Violent dealth is amazingly apt to remind us of vigorous life;  these ten stories of classic North Carolina murders which occurred between 1808 and 1914 represent a much neglected part of the exciting history of the state.  Victims include a Confederate general, a lovely orphan girl, a pathetic little boy, and a highly offensive political boss.  The motives are the usual ones -- gain, revenge, &quot;elimination,&quot; and jealousy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plaintive history and untimely death of Naomi Wise -- &quot;poor &#39;Omi&quot; they called her in Randolph County over five generations ago -- strikingly counterparts Dreiser&#39;s &lt;i&gt;An American Tragedy&lt;/i&gt;;  Ida Bell Warren, the veritable Lady Macbeth of Forsyth County;  the arsenic poisoner of old Fayetteville;  the kidnapping of Kenneth Beasley near the site of the Lost Colony;  the almost perfect crime, the murder of the hated Reconstruction Senator &quot;Chicken&quot; Stephens of Caswell County, which in spite of the efforts of Claude G. Bowers and others went unsolved for years;  the mad jealousy of Frankie Silver of Burke County which ended with bitter justice at the end of the law&#39;s noosed rope, the first woman hanged in the state -- these and other lively stories of famous North Carolina murders make fascinating reading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stories, told with authority and inviting informality, employ material from newspapers, court records, letters, family collections, and numerous works of local history. They evoke a feeling for a past time and place as well as for the untidy events themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
