Jack is tasked to find and acquire certain items and see that they are on Ark 33. Aldous Huxley is a reserve officer in the USA and Canada Army Reserves. The Federation has requested, from the USA and Canada, that their battalion be mobilized for a period of thirty-five days. There they will meet up with the rest of our battalion and become the aggressors in a war game on Rojus. Little do they know that the Xylocopa are also looking at Rojus as their new home." />
