  <title>Mars 2112 - John Ashcroft-Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is January 2112 and fifty years since global warming moved far past its tipping point. Max and his soul mate, Ann, are partners in Aqua4, an innovative company that uses the Space Elevator as part of a system to purify seawater and offset the planets rapidly rising sea levels. As their vacation ends in the Straits of Hormuz, they learn the moon bases want more water and that Mars is their new project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the world continues to unite to formulate solutions to the environmental crisis, Max and Ann board their spaceship and blast toward the Luna2 station in the geostationary orbit above the Pacific to resume their work. After docking at his companys headquarters, Max and his team begin to draw up the plans to send freshwater to Mars. But as he becomes immersed in a deadly game of strategy where he must outwit those who lurk in the shadows of space, now only time will tell if Maxs efforts to create a new habitable world will ever come to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this futuristic science-fiction adventure, an environmental entrepreneur and his team tirelessly work in a space station above Earth in an attempt to solve irreversible global warming challenges created by human activity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
