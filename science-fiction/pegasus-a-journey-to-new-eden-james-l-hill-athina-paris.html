  <title>PEGASUS: A Journey To New Eden - James L Hill, Athina Paris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Zack and Zuri are set to embark on the Pegasus for New Eden, an unknown and unexplored planet four light years from Earth. For Zack, four light years isn&amp;rsquo;t nearly far enough from the madness that has been mankind&amp;rsquo;s history. For Zuri, it is a chance to have the family she has so long desired. Pegasus is humanity&amp;rsquo;s greatest invention, a modern day Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark, set to spread civilization to the stars. But Pegasus has secrets which some will do anything to possess, and Zack and Zuri have yet to discover. A journey to New Eden is an emotional rollercoaster that will take the pair to the depths of despair, launch them beyond heavenly delights, and into the heart and soul of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pegasus, the first starship, will take the best that the world has to offer and transplant it on another world. Readers are taken on an emotional rollercoaster as the only two people to escape the escalating madness must wrestle control of the ship from its Artificial Intelligence and restore faith in human dignity. In this work, readers see a future that is just around the corner. Beware, technology advances faster than our knowledge of what to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
