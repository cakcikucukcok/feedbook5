  <title>The Death Maze - Richard Parnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dan Adams is grateful he has mastered the sixth dimension and is no longer controlled by Apep. Now free to explore and understand without mortal consequences, the scientist uses his meditative powers to return to his inner-self, knowing there is work left to be finished. Along the way, those he meets and works with are just as stunning as the parallel world he must navigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apep is angry, destructive, and more determined than ever to seek revenge for the loss of Dr. Adams, the one he wanted to enslave for all eternity. But what his monstrous form does not realize is that his soul is on the verge of no longer being. As Apep tries to manipulate the sixth dimension to reveal its open portal, he hopes to find his way into the three dimensional world and force the humans to worship him. Meanwhile as UCLA scientist Allyson Rayburn works to finish Dr. Adams AGE project, she and several others embark on a mission to first find the portal to the sixth dimension and then determine how to control it--without becoming the next victims. Unfortunately what they believe is possible is rapidly becoming an irrepressible force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this continuing tale, a scientist must rely on help from his colleagues as he searches for spiritual oneness and understanding and attempts to defeat the evil within the sixth dimension.&lt;/p&gt;" />
