  <title>Sagramanda - Alan Dean Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Set in Sagramanda, city of 100 million, this is the story of Taneer, a scientist who has absconded with his multinational corporation&amp;rsquo;s secret project code and who is now on the run from both the company and his father. Depahli, the fabulously beautiful woman from the &quot;untouchable class&quot; would die for him, just as surely as his father would like to kill him for shaming the very traditional family for such a relationship. Chalcedony &quot;Chal&quot; Schneemann doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to kill Taneer, if he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t upset him terribly much if it came to it, and he&amp;rsquo;ll stop at nothing to recover the stolen property for the company that pays him very, very well to solve big problems discreetly and quickly. Sanjay Ghosh, a poor farmer-turned-merchant in the big city of Sagramanda would like to help Taneer unload his stolen items, for the $30 million dollars his 3 percent fee is worth. Jena Chalmette, a crazy French woman pledged to Kali, simply wants to kill for the glory of her god, and she&amp;rsquo;s very good at it. Chief Inspector Keshu Singh would like to put this sword-wielding serial killer away as quickly as possible before the media gets a hold of the story. Then there&amp;rsquo;s a man-eating tiger, come in from the nearby jungle reserve and just looking for his next meal. A fast-paced and gripping techno-thriller set in an India just around the corner from today." />
