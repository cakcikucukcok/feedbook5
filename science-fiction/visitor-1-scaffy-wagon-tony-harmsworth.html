  <title>Visitor 1 Scaffy Wagon - Tony Harmsworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From where had it come?   This &#39;old school SciFi&#39; tells of the first ever space junk elimination. It encounters a badly damaged alien artefact in low-earth orbit. Who could have made it? What was its purpose? NASA, ESA &amp; Roscosmos impose secrecy. Is it the first alien object found? Are the rumours about previous encounters true after all?  Planet Earth has existed for four and a half billion years. The chance of our civilisation making contact with another is unimaginably tiny. If we sent a message to a neighbour today it could take years to arrive. Would the neighbour be home? Their civilisation may not begin for millions of years or might have died a billion years previously. To make contact, not only does the neighbour have to be intelligent and technologically advanced, but they also need to have a civilisation at the same time as us.  The VISITOR TRILOGY tells of just such a situation. And if a visitor does call, do we really want to invite them into our home?" />
