  <title>After the Devastation - Paul M. Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2024, the world is on the brink of nuclear war and environmental disaster. Nora Del Bosque tells her husband, Aden Delaterre, she must go to Chicago, to the new headquarters of the UN, to report on a crucial meeting. With the world situation looking grim, Aden fears for Nora&#39;s safety. As an environmental specialist, he understands the danger all too well.   His fears are confirmed when global disaster strikes during Nora&#39;s trip, and the two are lost to each other. In the ensuing years, they each lead lives in isolated communities without modern technology or the conveniences once taken for granted. Both become leaders within these fragments of civilization, facing a wide range of conflicts. In the process, Nora and Aden discover their own intuitive awakening and come to know and rely on their personal spirit guides-in hopes of one day finding each other.   In this tale of romance, political intrigue, and mysticism, humanity faces a post-apocalyptic crisis of devastating proportions." />
