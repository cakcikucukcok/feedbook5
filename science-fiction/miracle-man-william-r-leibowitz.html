  <title>Miracle Man - William R Leibowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;MIRACLE MAN by William R. Leibowitz has been unanimously heralded by reviewers and readers.&amp;nbsp; ONE OF AMAZON&amp;#39;S TOP 100 NOVELS OF 2015, AND AN AMAZON BEST SELLER AND WINNER OF A NATIONAL &amp;quot;BEST THRILLER&amp;quot; AWARD, the enthusiasm for this unique novel has been overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;MIRACLE MAN is a medical/conspiracy/psychological thriller that explores extraordinary genius, Big Pharma corruption, CIA machinations, metaphysical forces, and one man&amp;#39;s tireless quest at terrible cost to validate his life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;---&amp;nbsp;The victim of an unspeakable crime, an infant rises to become a new type of superhero. Unlike any that have come before him, he is not a fanciful creation of animators, he is real. So begins the saga of Robert James Austin, the greatest genius in human history. But where did his extraordinary intelligence come from? As agents of corporate greed vie with rabid anti-Western radicals to destroy him, an obsessive government leader launches a bizarre covert mission to exploit his intellect. Yet Austin&amp;#39;s greatest fear is not of this world. Aided by two exceptional women, one of whom will become his unlikely lover, Austin struggles against abandonment and betrayal. But the forces that oppose him are more powerful than even he can understand.&amp;nbsp; Robert James Austin is REVERED by many and REVILED by some.&amp;nbsp; But none can doubt that he is REMARKABLE.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MIRACLE MAN FEATURES A READERS CLUB GUIDE&lt;/p&gt;" />
