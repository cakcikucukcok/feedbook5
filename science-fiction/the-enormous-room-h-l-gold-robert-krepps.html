  <title>The Enormous Room - H.L. Gold, Robert Krepps</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The roller coaster&amp;#39;s string of cars, looking shopworn in their flaky blue and orange paint, crept toward the top of the incline, the ratcheted lift chain clanking with weary patience. In the front seat, a young couple held hands and prepared to scream. Two cars back, a heavy, round-shouldered, black-mustached man with a swarthy skin clenched his hands on the rail before him. A thin blond fellow with a briefcase on his lap glanced back and down at the receding platform, as though trying to spot a friend he had left behind. Behind him was a Negro youth, sitting relaxed with one lean foot on the seat; he looked as bored as someone who&amp;#39;d taken a thousand coaster rides in a summer and expected to take ten thousand more.&lt;br /&gt;
In the last car, a tall broad man put his elbows on the backboard and stared at the sky without any particular expression on his lined face.&lt;br /&gt;

The riders had a glimpse of the sprawling amusement park spread out below them like a collection of gaudy toys on the floor of a playroom; then the coaster was roaring and thundering down into the hollow of the first big dip.&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone but the Negro boy and the tall man yelled. These two looked detached&amp;mdash;without emotion&amp;mdash;as though they wouldn&amp;#39;t have cared if the train of cars went off the tracks.&lt;br /&gt;
The cars didn&amp;#39;t go off the tracks. The people did.&lt;br /&gt;
The orange-blue rolling stock hit the bottom, slammed around a turn and shot upward again, the wind of its passage whistling boisterously. But by then there were none to hear the wind, to feel the gust of it in watered eyes or open shouting mouths. The cars were empty..." />
