  <title>Two Standing - Brett Spencer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The inhabitants of the planet of Dosthlen have lived peacefully for centuries.  Eight different countries all existing on their own continents have never had any reason to fight.  They have lived their lives, created their civilizations, and built their cities.  Only now, they have built too much.  Their technology has allowed them to move off the planet and colonize space and their moons.  For the first time in their existence, they have something to fight over.  Every country has a stake in this new territory, and is willing to fight for it.  But no one has any understanding of how to fight a war.  The leaders of all eight countries now scramble to build new weapons and find anyone in their countries who have a natural ability to use them.  Some wage aggressive assaults that cause the deaths of numerous people on both sides, and others lay low as long as possible before they are forced into the conflict.  Many build weapons that are more destructive than they realize.  One such weapon trumps them all and is capable of sealing a victory for anyone who wields it.  But when that weapon is lost out in space, it becomes a race to see who can get to it first.  But no one is prepared for the destruction that will come upon all the countries by the time their war is over." />
