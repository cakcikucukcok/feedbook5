  <title>The Transient, the Emperor, and the Man Left Alone - Jacob Harrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Derren Washingtons life has never amounted to much, and lately it has become boring and stale. Sure, he does well for himself. He has a job, a place to live, and is breathing and livingenough for most people and all Derren believes he needs. 
And then one morning, Derren is awoken to an unexpected knock that changes the course of his life, spurring a mad journey that he never could have possibly imagined. Confronted with the sudden loss of his apartment and, subsequently, everything he has ever owned, Derren must face the insensitive marriage of blind chance and sheer coincidence. His situation becomes even more dire after a regrettably made phone call finds him abducted by a group of towering extraterrestrials who have mistaken him for their long, lost emperor. Now Derren struggles to navigate and survive in a baffling world amid suffocating seas of deceit and absurdity in hopes of one day making his way home and finding some meaning in his life.
This science fiction novel tells the tale of one mans unintended adventure as he stumbles from one confusing world to another in an attempt to regain what he has lost." />
