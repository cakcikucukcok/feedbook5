  <title>Rose Star Runners - Alex Benitez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Get the diamond!
Strap yourself in and blast off on a genuine adventure.
Rose Star Runners will guide the way. In this not so farfetched
rendition of the future, well follow three characters as they are
unsuspectingly pulled into a journey that spans the universe.
Experience the sensation of having your feet on the sidewalk
of a city of glass or sharing a romantic glass of champagne
on a lunar cruise circling a planet. All this will be yours and
more when you peek inside this book. Read as science fi ction,
adventure, romance, and most of all, humor are seamlessly woven
together in a dazzling tapestry that is Rose Star Runners.
So join Ky, Will and Jina as they set forth on a quest to save
the universe.
Ky, Will, and Jina decide to get temporary jobs to
deal with their mounting bills. That is when little Will catches
a glimpse of a huge diamond. After much persuasion, Will
convinces his comrades to steal the jewel. They are not the
only ones with their eyes on the diamond. The Galactic Federal
Bureau, an alien race called Arlians, an insane religious cult,
and a whacked out cyborg named Locharp also has hopes of
taking it. Our heroes must contend with them to successfully retrieve
it, but as their efforts begin to pay off they fi nd that there
is much more to the diamond then meets the eye. Help Ky, Will
and Jina along their galaxy spanning rat race to secure the
diamond before all hope is lost and catch your fi rst peek into
the world of Rose Star." />
