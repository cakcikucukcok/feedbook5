  <title>Mystery Ii - O H Delgado</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Big Bang
	The modern science of Cosmology has given us a model of the physical creation we know as the Universe. They call it the Cosmos. They say, and I agree, that Something, infinitely dense exploded around 13-14 billion years ago. They call it the Big Bang. They know nothing of that Something that exploded; nor can they ever know with their minds in the physical realm with its physical laws and math. In fact, they are a bit frustrated and embarrassed . . . so they call this enigma a Singularity.
	The author has solved this Singularity in his first book:
Mystery of Being
Black Holes and the Big Crunch
	This book is a sequel to the first. Another Singularity has really stumped and depressed them: Black Holes. In the center of every galaxy is an infinitely dense, mysterious Black Hole with an infinitely powerful gravity field. They do not give out any radiation; so they are invisible to the eye and to all modern instruments. Their most threatening feature is their devouring gravity field.
	Einsteins equations of his general theory of relativity predict that these Black Holes will eventually swallow up ALL the physical universe then collapse into each other and form the Big Crunch. Cosmologists sadly agree with Einstein. The destruction of the physical realm is inevitable. I sense a deep depression when I observe, study the brilliant minds since Einstein to today. I sense empty hopeless hearts. The men I studied are all atheists. They are mired in the physical realm.
	The author introduces the Supernatural Realm, with Superior Dimensions and a Superior Spectrum. The physical realm will be redeemed along with the souls who accept Gods Love!
	The author redefines gravity; also introduces a new
Theory of
SUPERNATURAL
Relativity" />
