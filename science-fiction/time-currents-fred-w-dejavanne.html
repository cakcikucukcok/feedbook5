  <title>Time Currents - Fred W. deJavanne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="TIME CURRENTS
Surfing the waves of paradox
Time travel neednt be a stretch. Were all time travelers. In our waking world, we seem to travel or ride on a shared vector -- the time axis -- moving into the future at a fixed rate with all our companions. Have we left an inalterable past behind us? Know that as Spaceship Earth courses through the ocean of spacetime, it leaves a traceable, luminous trail in its wake.
Therein lies the first secret of the physics of time travel.
When the body sleeps, we awaken to ourselves and to our true power under the sway of a wiser and nobler part of us -- an unsleeping creative being within -- whose hand is on a time rheostat of unlimited range in which a second can be an hour and a minute a year, utterly real on our own timeline. For the physicist, this creative imaging faculty, operating in massless diachronic space, possesses electrical reality, and consists in the excitation of an internal spatiotemporal field, volitionally controlled and executed, and fully consonant with natural law.
Therein lies the second secret.
At Area 51, they could not have known the magnitude and the scale of the forces that they were about to unleash. Luckily, the Nommo, their extraterrestrial guest, knew more. Therein lies the tale.
The author doesnt fl aunt his erudition, which is legendary, but you quickly discover it on your own as your mind grows and expands in the minds of the characters at Area 51. Prof. deJavanne has a rare gift for making complex and subtle ideas easy to understand  and fun. 
Dr. Robert A. Rose, Rewiring your Brain
Time Currents is distinguishable from your everyday space opera by the sheer magnitude of what is at stake, the depth of the characters, rock solid science, and the villains you will love to hate. It is an engaging story with a surprise ending. 
Hugh J. Thompson, Creative Linguistics
Time Currents is a tale of two epochs, a century apart, bridged by an authentic genius, a gorgeous, sensual Russian beauty, a brilliant inventor and an alien. It is both entertaining and thought provoking. But beware: if you follow the science and the logic too closely you may start believing it. That just wont do! After all, it is fi ction. Isnt it?
