  <title>Cowboy Knight Salvation - Circle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cowboy Knight Salvation is a tale of choices and directions about one of the last American generals, Alan Cally, who has to face the reality that all he has done for war against the individualist was wrong.
He had a love of the Old West from movies he had only seen from childhood, but that would all change when he and his AI robotic horse, Ranger, explore the New West. They encounter a frontier teaming with giant creatures from the past. 
His love for adventure would lead him to a man who would help him change everything he stood for and humble his very soul. 
This is a story with action, adventure, tragedy, and most of all, hope. Like the New West, he would learn to become a new man." />
