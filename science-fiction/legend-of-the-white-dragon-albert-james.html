  <title>Legend of the White Dragon - Albert James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sheena never would have believed that she and Tish would be principle players in the destiny of mankind, but when their covers are blown and they&#39;re detained and interrogated in Jerusalem, everything changes! 
Tish&#39;s world is shattered in a single night, but later learns that things may not be as they appear, but questions the motives of all humanity. 
When their captured by the US, life becomes perilous in a Country that&#39;s obsessed with brutality in the shadows of corruption, where money can buy anything regardless of how atrocious, if you got it, if don&#39;t, then God help you. Sheena thought it was more than Tish&#39;s alluring beauty and charm as everyone&#39;s obsession with her kept growing, including Sheena&#39;s. It was her innocence that Tish brought into the most hostile enviroments that drove everyone crazy. She was like a ray of sunlight in the night, in a world of darkness, and also why the Emperpor wanted to posess Tish so desparately, when all she wanted was to be accepted as a normal girl.
Conrad had chased her all over the planet and she was still running from him." />
