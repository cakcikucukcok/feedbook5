  <title>The Quantum Thief - Hannu Rajaniemi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Quantum Thief&lt;/i&gt; is a Kirkus Reviews Best of 2011 Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;. One of &lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Best SF/Fantasy Books of 2011 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Jean le Flambeur is a post-human criminal, mind burglar, confidence artist, and trickster. His origins are shrouded in mystery, but his exploits are known throughout the Heterarchy- from breaking into the vast Zeusbrains of the Inner System to stealing rare Earth antiques from the aristocrats of Mars. Now he&#39;s confined inside the Dilemma Prison, where every day he has to get up and kill himself before his other self can kill him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rescued by the mysterious Mieli and her flirtatious spacecraft, Jean is taken to the Oubliette, the Moving City of Mars, where time is currency, memories are treasures, and a moon-turnedsingularity lights the night. What Mieli offers is the chance to win back his freedom and the powers of his old self-in exchange for finishing the one heist he never quite managed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Jean undertakes a series of capers on behalf of Mieli and her mysterious masters, elsewhere in the Oubliette investigator Isidore Beautrelet is called in to investigate the murder of a chocolatier, and finds himself on the trail of an arch-criminal, a man named le Flambeur.... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hannu Rajaniemi&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Quantum Thief &lt;/i&gt;is a crazy joyride through the solar system several centuries hence, a world of marching cities, ubiquitous public-key encryption, people communicating by sharing memories, and a race of hyper-advanced humans who originated as MMORPG guild members. But for all its wonders, it is also a story powered by very human motives of betrayal, revenge, and jealousy. It is a stunning debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
