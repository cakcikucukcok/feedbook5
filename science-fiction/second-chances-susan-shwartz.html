  <title>Second Chances - Susan Shwartz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a departure for this very well-reviewed fantasist, Susan Shwartz has returned to her science fiction roots with a riveting novel of honor and its loss, love and its betrayal, and the exploration of what it means to be a true hero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Susan Shwartz has done is to take a well-loved tale and it in an unconventional setting.  Second Chances is nothing less than an homage to Joseph Conrad-think of &lt;i&gt;Lord Jim&lt;/i&gt; in space. Just as Conrad explored in great depth the perplexing, ambiguous problem of lost honor and guilt, expiation and heroism, Shwartz has created in her Jim a man haunted by guilt over an act of supposed cowardice and his lifelong efforts to somehow atone for that action-whether or not he merited the disgrace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Conrad&#39;s Jim was a tragic and ultimately noble hero, so too is Shwartz&#39;s Jim.  A professional soldier whose time has passed, Jim is stationed about the corporate BioShip Irian Jaya  security for a commercial venture critical to humanity&#39;s continued survival. The war that sundered whole worlds is over and now he&#39;s just another &quot;tin soldier,&quot; a prop for the military to look good to war-weary civilians.   But he&#39;s never stopped caring about those who scorn him and the ideals that he still clings to.  That caring is tested, however, when he is thrust into a scandal not of his making.  He chooses to carry the burden of guilt, no matter what.  Because of his pride . . . . and maybe because that&#39;s the one thing he has left.  Out of this madness will come the biggest battle for his honor and his soul. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And perhaps, a promise of a second chance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
