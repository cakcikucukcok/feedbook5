They have to figure out how to survive every night in an otherworldly California where the zombie hordes have all developed different mutations and abilities. They&amp;#39;ve also attracted the attention of the evil Judge and his Protectorate Army which has agents and traps at every turn. The good news is, they are each discovering their own powers along the way but, they may not live long enough to see what will become of them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
