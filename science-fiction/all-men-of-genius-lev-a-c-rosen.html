      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Inspired by two of the most beloved works by literary masters, &lt;i&gt;All Men of Genius &lt;/i&gt;takes place in an alternate Steampunk Victorian London, where science makes the impossible possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violet Adams wants to attend Illyria College, a widely renowned school for the most brilliant up-and-coming scientific minds, founded by the late Duke Illyria, the greatest scientist of the Victorian Age. The school is run by his son, Ernest, who has held to his father&#39;s policy that the small, exclusive college remain male-only. Violet sees her opportunity when her father departs for America. She disguises herself as her twin brother, Ashton, and gains entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But keeping the secret of her sex won&#39;t be easy, not with her friend Jack&#39;s constant habit of pulling pranks, and especially not when the duke&#39;s young ward, Cecily, starts to develop feelings for Violet&#39;s alter ego, &quot;Ashton.&quot; Not to mention blackmail, mysterious killer automata, and the way Violet&#39;s pulse quickens whenever the young duke, Ernest (who has a secret past of his own), speaks to her. She soon realizes that it&#39;s not just keeping her secret until the end of the year faire she has to worry about: it&#39;s surviving that long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
