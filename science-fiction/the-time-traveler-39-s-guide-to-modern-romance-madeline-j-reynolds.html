  <title>The Time Traveler&#39;s Guide to Modern Romance - Madeline J. Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Elias Caldwell needs more than his life in nineteenth-century England has to offer. He&#39;d rather go on an adventure than spend one more minute at some stuffy party. When his grandfather gives him a pocket watch he claims can transport him to any place and time, Elias doesn&#39;t believe it...until he&#39;s whisked away to twenty-first-century America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Forrester just wants to fall hopelessly in love. But making that kind of connection with someone has been more of a dream than reality. Then a boy appears out of thin air, a boy from the past. As he helps Elias navigate a strange new world for him, introducing him to the wonders of espresso, binge-watching, and rock and roll, Tyler discovers Elias is exactly who he was missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their love has time limit. Elias&#39;s disappearance from the past has had devastating side effects, and now he must choose where he truly belongs--in the Victorian era, or with the boy who took him on an adventure he never dreamed possible?&lt;/p&gt;" />
