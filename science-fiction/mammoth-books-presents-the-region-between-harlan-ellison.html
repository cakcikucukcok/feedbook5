  <title>Mammoth Books presents The Region Between - Harlan Ellison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;The Region Between&quot; first appeared in &lt;I&gt;Galaxy&lt;/I&gt; back in 1970. It had originally been commissioned as one of a set of stories by different authors who all used a common starting point as set out in the story&#39;s prologue, written by Keith Laumer. Ellison&#39;s contribution was a longer work than one usually expects from him, but it nevertheless sustains its bombardment of ideas and feelings throughout. What&#39;s more, Ellison created a story that demanded a different format to allow for full expression. The result was a typesetter&#39;s nightmare but, as you will see, the experience now only makes this story all the more fascinating, it actually takes you into the story itself.
