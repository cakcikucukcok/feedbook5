  <title>2012: the Zombie Apocalypse - Ryan Tomasella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="2012: The Zombie Apocalypse is a riveting tale of survival in a post-apocalyptic world overrun with zombies. A group of unlikely survivors are forced to band together to find salvation in a horror-drenched world. Led by Ryan and surrounded by undead monsters, the survivors journey across the wastelands in search of a precious and increasingly rare commoditylife.
&quot;But wait,&quot; I say. &quot;The zombies in I Am Legend were just infected and could be cured, not similar to these types of zombies.&quot; I sit down on my couch and scratch my head.
&quot;I&#39;m being so childish here; I&#39;m comparing what is happening right now to movies. I need to figure out what needs to be done,&quot; I say before pushing myself off the couch and walking into my office.
I grab a notepad from the desk as well as a pen before returning to the couch and sitting down. I push everything off the table and onto the floor before placing the notepad on the table. &quot;Alright first things first I need to hunker down and hold my position for the night. First thing tomorrow morning I need to get out of the city, it isn&#39;t safe here, the population is too high. I can easily get overwhelmed and eaten.&quot;" />
