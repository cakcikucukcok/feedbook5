  <title>Empyrean Stories - Nathan R Large, Laine M Lundquist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our Empyrean Dreams are stories from a future civilization, where Humankind is only one of several star-faring cultures struggling to coexist in a shared galaxy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most powerful of these cultures are joined together in a treaty organization known as the Collective.&amp;nbsp; Commerce and self-interest are the binding principles of the Collective: member states hold standing to the degree their culture proves its economic power and value to the whole.&amp;nbsp; The ruling cultures of the Collective distinguish themselves by their unique innovations and capabilities; the Humans of Terra were fortunate to possess talents sufficient to earn membership.&amp;nbsp; Outside of the Collective&amp;rsquo;s elite, many more sentient species exist, either tolerating this authority as members or rejecting the Collective entirely.&amp;nbsp; An uneasy peace holds both within and without this interstellar civilization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most intelligent beings are more interested in pursuing their personal lives and goals and less concerned about galactic politics.&amp;nbsp; They study, work, build, fight, and love as best they can within their own cultures and worlds.&amp;nbsp; A few sentients find themselves drawn across borders: across cultures, across star systems, or even across realities.&amp;nbsp; Scholars catch glimpses of how old, complex, and strange the Universe really is.&amp;nbsp; Diplomats encounter the frayed threads of alliance and must decide whether to bind or cut them.&amp;nbsp; Explorers traverse the tangled webs of civilization and navigation.&amp;nbsp; Criminals seek advantage in the cracks of society&amp;hellip; and authorities seek to prevent their damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the stories we present: the future history of a civilization that rises - and could fall - based on the actions of its parts.&amp;nbsp; These are the tales of people and events, individually small compared to the grand Empyrean scope, but with the potential to reshape portions of that existence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the dreams of beings whose choices can influence their Universe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
