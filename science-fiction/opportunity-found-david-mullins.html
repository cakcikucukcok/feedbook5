  <title>Opportunity Found - David Mullins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Humans have expanded out into their solar system and the Off Earth Settlers have created a truly free society. Independent people living the life they want with no interference. But this life hangs in the balance. Living off Earth requires a great deal of energy which means a great deal of methane is needed. Luckily a ready supply is laying right here on the surface of Pluto, an icy rock at the edge of mankind&#39;s space. Timothy Krane and his crew are here, struggling constantly against the unforgiving environment and the unrelenting cold, to keep the supply line running. Everything changes when they discover a murderer among them. This is followed by a series of seemingly pointless and increasingly deadly acts of sabotage which crank up the pressure cooker they are living in.   Thrust into a role he is ill prepared for, Krane must work to uncover those responsible as he tries to prevent his crew and the miners from splitting into warring factions and, as always, to keep the methane moving." />
