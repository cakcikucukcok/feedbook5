  <title>Frek and the Elixir - Rudy Rucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the year 3003, nothing in the world is the same, except maybe that adolescents are still embarrassed by their parents. Society and the biosphere alike have been transformed by biotechnology, and the natural world is almost gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frek Huggins is a boy from a broken family, a misfit because he&#39;s a natural child, conceived without technological help or genetic modifications. His dad, Carb, is a malcontent who left behind Frek&#39;s mom and the Earth itself several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything changes when Frek finds the Anvil, a small flying saucer, under his bed, and it tells him  he is destined to save the world. The repressive forces of Gov, the mysterious absolute ruler of Earth, descend on Frek, take away the Anvil, and interrogate him forcefully enough to damage his memory. Frek flees with Wow, his talking dog, to seek out Carb and some answers. But the untrustworthy alien in the saucer has other plans, including claiming exclusive rights to market humanity to the galaxy at large, and making Frek a hero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Frek and the Elixir&lt;/i&gt; is a profound, playful SF epic by the wild and ambitious Rudy Rucker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
