  <title>After the Fall, Before the Fall, During the Fall - Nancy Kress</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;2012 Nebula Award Winner&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;2012 Locus Award Winner&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;2013 Hugo Nominee&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;2013 Sturgeon Award Nominee&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the year 2035, all that is left of humanity lives in the Shell.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No one knows why the Tesslies attacked in 2014, devastated the environment, and nearly destroyed humanity. Or why the aliens imprisoned twenty-six survivors in a sterile enclosure built on the barren remains of the Earth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fifteen-year-old Pete, one of only six children born in the Shell, is determined to lead humanity to a new beginning. But Pete struggles to control his anger as, one by one, the survivors sicken and die. Although the Earth appears to be slowly healing, the Shell&amp;#8217;s inhabitants may not live long enough to see it. The only chance for humanity lies within brief time portals. Peter and the survivors hatch a desperate plan: to increase their numbers by abducting children from the past.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the year 2013, a brilliant CIA consultant sees a pattern in seemingly unrelated kidnappings. As Julie Kahn&amp;#8217;s predictive algorithms reveal that the world is in imminent danger, she discovers that she may also play a role in its possible rebirth. Julie and Pete are rapidly converging in time&amp;#151;a chance encounter between them may be the Earth&amp;#8217;s only hope.&lt;/div&gt;" />
