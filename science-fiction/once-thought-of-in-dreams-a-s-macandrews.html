  <title>Once Thought of in Dreams - A.S. MacAndrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the future, biological structure is subjective, the truth is nothing more than a paid advertisement, and former definitions of words and historical events are nothing more than lies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Forest is a peaceful home to many. Monica and her family, like many generations before her, have enjoyed the Forest&amp;rsquo;s fruits and freedoms. Like many contemporary middle-class people, Monica has grown up believing in a powerful thing known as beeswax and so she has kept her nose out of other people&amp;rsquo;s business, by leaving her beeswax firmly set in her ears. When the Forest begins to undergo socio-economic change and her beeswax slips out, Monica feels forced to have an opinion. Her husband, Tadders, decides he wants to be a bird and fly way up high to the rainbow. Her children, Twig and Bearton, are beginning to learn that their biology is less structural and more fluid. The school has instructed the cubs to spy on their parents and report if they are using unsavory language such as ma and pa. More and more, Monica voices her opinion as the sheep migrate to the Forest by the billions and the chanceselling bodies can do nothing more than make sure no one is saying offensive words. As citizens die or lose their livelihoods, the chanceselling bodies sole mission seems to make sure no one is using offensive and naughty language that might hurt someone&amp;rsquo;s feelings. Monica, like many in the middle majority, misses the days of her youth when she did not feel the need to have an opinion but could say whatever she damn well pleased without chancesellment interference or always looking over her shoulder to ensure a thin-skinned prima donna was not skulking nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a time in the Forest when the busybodies of society weren&amp;rsquo;t trying their best to make a fuss over every droplet of spilt milk and forcing everyone into an apology over every little offence. Monica leaves her refuge of silence and speaks her mind only to have the beaver-operated mainstream media confront her. Monica is someone who does not want an opinion, who wants to keep to herself. Her speaking up is a natural, instinctive reaction to the &amp;ldquo;unbiased&amp;rdquo; Journo Bear, who seems to be running a campaign for Mother Nature rather than reporting the news. A once peaceful democratic republic, no one wants to admit the Forest is now nothing more than a front for a brutal authoritarian Holiwarchy that implements crude verbal attacks on anyone who questions the changes going on. Will Monica and her family survive the brave new forest, or will they succumb to the verbal abuse, accusations, and constant bombardment from unbiased Journo Bear? Will Journo Bear be a big brother and explain to everyone that death is nothing more than a sweet hibernation and their freedoms, like the moon landing and the greatest generation, never existed so they aren&amp;rsquo;t worth fighting for?&lt;/p&gt;" />
