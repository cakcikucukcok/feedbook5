  <title>Downward to the Earth - Robert Silverberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who knoweth the spirit of men that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?  -&lt;i&gt;Ecclesiastes&lt;/i&gt; 3:21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, they did resemble elephants, it can&#39;t be denied. That led many people to underestimate the Nildoror and their obviously more fearsome commensals, the Sulidoror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But aliens should never be judged by human standards, as the Company learned to its cost when Holman&#39;s World, now once again known as Belzagor, was given back to the natives and the Company sent packing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Edmund Gunderson, once head of the Company&#39;s operation on this world, has come back across the galaxy to settle old scores with the Nildoror. If he can even get them to acknowledge his existence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Downward to the Earth&lt;/i&gt; is a classic from the golden age of Robert Silverberg&#39;s career in the 1970s. His homage to Joseph Conrad&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Heart of Darkness&lt;/i&gt;, it remains as fresh and powerful today as the day it was written. Our Orb edition will have a map of Gunderson&#39;s journey across Belzagor and a new introduction by the author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
