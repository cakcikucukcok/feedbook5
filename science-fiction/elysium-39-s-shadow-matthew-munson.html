  <title>Elysium&#39;s Shadow - Matthew Munson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a hell of a first day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jon May has been the Governor of Elysium for a few hours, and he&amp;rsquo;s already facing a belligerent Chief of Security, an ex-Operations Manager imprisoned for killing the previous Governor, and an amorphous energy mass that has its own agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now Jon has to decide who to trust; his Security Chief will barely talk to him, and his only allies people who are, according to the Republic, dangerous criminals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With less than 48 hours to delve into the shadows surrounding Elysium&amp;rsquo;s recent but tumultuous past, May is about to uncover more about this job than he bargained for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fall From Grace &lt;em&gt;is fantastic and unbelievably exciting. I love the way Matthew turns the history of the angels on its head, and the characters are so real I was almost in tears near the end. Simply fantastic.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; JR Walker, &lt;em&gt;actor and author&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Great story, good characters. A really refreshing take on the Judeo-Christian mythology which has been done to death recently. But &lt;/em&gt;Fall from Grace&lt;em&gt; has plenty of surprises up its sleeve. As a debut novel, this is a great piece of work. &lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash; Craig Hallam, &lt;em&gt;author of Greaveburn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The storyline is written to keep you on your toes and engaged; I was unable to put this book down. The writing style is easy to read, yet there is a deep plot that keeps you wanting to know more. Worth every penny. &amp;ndash; Oregon Rain, &lt;em&gt;Top Amazon reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
