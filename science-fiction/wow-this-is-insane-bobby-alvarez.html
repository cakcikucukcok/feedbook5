&lt;p&gt;How to sum up my crazy life in a few sentences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, here goes: Those are probably Mobster spacecraft looking to both kill me, since I have a list of their names and crimes on my contact lens, and to retrieve the time-travel arm bands that I just dumped in your trash scow.

So, I figured if I got the bands into the sun, at least I could die knowing I had done something good with my last great act of defiance.&lt;/p&gt;
