  <title>Vampire Journals (Books 2 and 3) - Morgan Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A book to rival TWILIGHT and VAMPIRE DIARIES, and one that will have you wanting to keep reading until the very last page! If you are into adventure, love and vampires this book is the one for you!&quot; &lt;p&gt;--Vampirebooksite.com (Turned)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The #1 Bestseller! &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bundle of  books 2 and 3 in Morgan Rice&#39;s #1 Bestselling series THE VAMPIRE JOURNALS (LOVED and BETRAYED). Here are two bestselling novels, all in one convenient file. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In LOVED (Book #2 in the Vampire Journals), Caitlin and Caleb embark together on their quest to find the one object that can stop the imminent vampire and human war: the lost sword. An object of vampire lore, there is grave doubt over whether it even exists.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caitlin and Caleb&#39;s journey takes them on a whirlwind of historic locations-from the Hudson Valley, to Salem, to the heart of historic Boston-the very spot where witches were once hung on the hill of Boston Common. Why are these locations so important to the vampire race? And what do they have to do with Caitlin&#39;s ancestry, and with who she&#39;s becoming?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may not even make it. Caitlin and Caleb&#39;s love for each other is blossoming. And their forbidden romance may just destroy everything they&#39;ve set out to achieve....&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In BETRAYED (Book #3 in the Vampire Journals), Caitlin Paine awakes from a deep coma to discover she has been turned. Now a true, full-bred vampire, she marvels at her new powers, including her ability to fly, and her superhuman strength. She finds that her true love, Caleb, is still by her side, waiting patiently for her to recover. She has everything she could dream of.&lt;p&gt;Until it all, suddenly, goes terribly wrong.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caitlin finds consolation in her new surroundings. She finds she has been placed on a hidden island in the Hudson River-Pollepel-amidst an elite coven of teenage vampires, boys and girls alike, 24 in all, including her. She learns that this is a place for outcasts, just like her, and as she meets her new best friend, Polly, and begins her training in elite vampire combat, she realizes that she might finally have a place to call home.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Morgan Rice proves herself again to be an extremely talented storyteller....This would appeal to a wide range of audiences, including younger fans of the vampire/fantasy genre. It ended with an unexpected cliffhanger that leaves you shocked.&quot;&lt;p&gt;-The Romance Reviews (regarding Loved)" />
