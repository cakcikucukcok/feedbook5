  <title>Ultima Thule - Dallas Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At least he&amp;#39;d got far enough to wind up with a personal interview. It&amp;#39;s one thing doing up an application and seeing it go onto an endless tape and be fed into the maw of a machine and then to receive, in a matter of moments, a neatly printed rejection. It&amp;#39;s another thing to receive an appointment to be interviewed by a placement officer in the Commissariat of Interplanetary Affairs, Department of Personnel. Ronny Bronston was under no illusions. Nine out of ten men of his age annually made the same application. Almost all were annually rejected. Statistically speaking practically nobody ever got an interplanetary position. But he&amp;#39;d made step one along the path of a lifetime ambition.&lt;br /&gt;
He stood at easy attention immediately inside the door. At the desk at the far side of the room the placement officer was going through a sheaf of papers.

Ronny took the chair. For a moment he tried to appear alert, earnest, ambitious but not&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;ambitious, fearless, devoted to the cause, and indispensable. For a moment. Then he gave it up and looked like Ronny Bronston.&lt;br /&gt;
The other looked up and took him in. The personnel official saw a man of averages. In the late twenties. Average height, weight and breadth. Pleasant of face in an average sort of way, but not handsome. Less than sharp in dress, hair inclined to be on the undisciplined side. Brown of hair, dark of eye. In a crowd, inconspicuous. In short, Ronny Bronston.&lt;br /&gt;
