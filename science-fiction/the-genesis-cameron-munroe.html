      <meta name="description" content="In the first chapter, Adam is abducted and finds out that he has special abilities that are unique to him and his counterparts in other planes, to which he discovers he has or will have connections with a total of six connections. With these connections with the other planes, he gains the ability to travel anywhere in the helix of time. He will set out to discover his new abilities, discovering how life started on Earth and events that changed the evolution of man. He has many things that he wants to do, so he and an alien that travels with him travel in the Geneses to different times discovering several things that through observation changes how things unravel throughout the beginning of life. 
There are influences of the situations that also change the destiny of mankind, through the people of Atlantis, Egyptians, and the Mayans. There are so many things that have changed the history of mankind. Adam and Jescan, the alien, experience many things, and Adams abilities increase as they proceed through these changes. As he discovers his abilities, he in turn evolves, with the help of the other planes." />
