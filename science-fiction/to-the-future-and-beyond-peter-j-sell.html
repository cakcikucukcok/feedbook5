Those left on earth were determined to return the earth back to its former glory, and so set about transforming it with the reintroduction of animals and plant now extinct.  A Sphinx was discovered in the Sahara which in itself was not significant but it was found to be a million years old and had been grown into the shape, not carved.  This starts an adventure that eventually leads to the Future and Beyond via the Orphan Planet.  They had to go into the past to discover who and why the Sphinx was grown but inadvertently altered the future which when they came back was our past.
