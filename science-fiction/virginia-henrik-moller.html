  <title>Virginia - Henrik Moller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In July of 1587, one hundred and seventeen English men, women, and children arrive at a very small island off the Eastern shore of a vast New World.  They arrived in hope, the hope of a better future for themselves and their descendants. A month later, in August, a little girl, Virginia Dare, becomes the first child of English parents born in the New World.  Nine days later, Virginia&#39;s grandfather, John White, the Governor of the English colony, returns to England.  He is the last European to see any of the colonists alive.  In December of 2002, Evan Merrill is surprised to discover that sometimes even very ordinary-looking computers have very unexpected capabilities.  And he&#39;s even more surprised when a very frightened girl, speaking very old-fashioned English, steps out of a dream and into his life." />
