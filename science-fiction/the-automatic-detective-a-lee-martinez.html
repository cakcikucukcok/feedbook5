  <title>The Automatic Detective - A. Lee Martinez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Gil&#39;s All Fright Diner&lt;/i&gt; comes a fantastic sci-fi mystery read &lt;i&gt;The Automatic Detective&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in Empire City, a town where weird science is the hope for tomorrow, it&#39;s hard for a robot to make his way. It&#39;s even harder for a robot named Mack Megaton, a hulking machine designed to bring mankind to its knees. But Mack&#39;s not interested in world domination. He&#39;s just a bot trying to get by, trying to demonstrate that he isn&#39;t just an automated smashing machine, and to earn his citizenship in the process. It should be as easy as crushing a tank for Mack, but some bots just can&#39;t catch a break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mack&#39;s neighbors are kidnapped, Mack sets off on a journey through the dark alleys and gleaming skyscrapers of Empire City. Along the way, he runs afoul of a talking gorilla, a brainy dame, a mutant lowlife, a little green mob boss, and the secret conspiracy at the heart of Empire&#39;s founders---not to mention more trouble than he bargained for. What started out as one missing family becomes a battle for the future of Empire and every citizen that calls her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
