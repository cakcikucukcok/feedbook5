  <title>Beyond Creation’S End - Nicholas P W Coe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fifty thousand years in the future the universe begins to collapse prematurely. Despite having advanced technology the only viable options to survive the end of the universe come down to creating a Dyson Sphere enclosed in shielding that would resist the collapsing forces during the progression towards singularity and investigating a mysterious object that has been sighted two billion light years away towards the edge of the universe. Because of its bizarre nature this enigmatic vessel is rumored to have come from a prior universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Dyson is being built and populated, Mila and Thorne are sent on what is considered a long shot expedition to see if the rumors are true; if this strange object is really from a prior universe, could it guide them to the next? On a planet where the infrastructure is failing, Strider and his mysterious telepathic companion known only as The Sylk struggle to survive in the hope of finding answers to questions they can barely even understand yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As all these paths converge can humanity forge a path beyond the end of this universe; can they find a way forward to a new future?&lt;/p&gt;" />
