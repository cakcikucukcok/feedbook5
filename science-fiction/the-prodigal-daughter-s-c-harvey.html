  <title>The Prodigal Daughter - S.C. Harvey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Almost a year has passed, and Madisons powers continue to grow. The agency has doubled their efforts to recapture her. William, the operative who trapped her once before, has his own agenda now, and he is not about to let her go. Using his special abilities and position, Nicholas wants to build Madison a home where she will be safe, but the lovers future lies across an ocean of questions. Who is Madison really? What waits in the home she left fourteen years before? As old enemies return, a new and powerful challenger emerges. A shadow is cast over her future in Thylea, causing Madison to question everything. Is she strong enough to fight for the future she wants? Is she the last line of defense from a distant enemy or is she the instrument for Thyleas destruction? 
As they say, there is no place like home. 
The Prodigal Daughter is the thrilling sequel to Sand Castles &amp; Seashores." />
