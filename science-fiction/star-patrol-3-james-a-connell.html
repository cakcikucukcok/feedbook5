  <title>Star Patrol 3 - James A. Connell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This part of the story begins several months after Man&#39;s colonies and the Earth itself have been invaded from outside the realm of human worlds by alien creatures called Globes.  They have but one purpose, to breed.
	Globes are able to manipulate energy in the same way Human made machines can, allowing them to move in space and discharge that energy towards the destruction of human defenses, namely the Star Patrol&#39;s Fleet of defending Starships.  Their fearless offspring, voracious, nine foot long killers known as Slimers, can infest the surface of a planet destroying and devouring all other lifeforms they encounter.
	With Globes and Slimers threatening Mankind with extinction they find that they are not the only enemy.  Humans still conspire against their fellow humans for control and dominance.
	A soldier, Mary Como, a Doctor, Samantha Wilson, and the crew of the ancient Starship Pegasus were early participants of the war and although Mary, and the others were once affiliated with the Star Patrol, they have since pulled away from that organization and what they perceive to be a deep rooted corruption of the Patrol&#39;s hierarchy.  However, unable to completely distance themselves, they find they are in an uneasy alliance with their former Commanding Officer, Louis Chen, &quot;Admiral Rat&quot;.  With known and unknown human forces against them, as well as Globes and Slimers, Mary feels that it might be better to be  allied with the still powerful Star Patrol than to continue on their own as make believe Pirates.
	After a medical mission with an unexpected encounter with Slimers in the outer reaches of the solar system, Mary and her crew take over an abandoned Star Patrol Base in the North American Rockies.  Settling into their new home they begin to feel some semblance of peace and quiet.  It isn&#39;t long before bounty hunters, mercenaries, unexpected rescue missions, and more encounters with Globes and Slimers make their lives more than interesting once again.  Now the Admiral wants them to help train commandos.
	One particular favor for the Admiral leads them into conflict with an old enemy, Anton Spect and his Hades Empire.  At first they are unaware of the political maneuvering forming against them, but it will take all of their intelligence and cunning to overcome this latest threat.  Maybe it&#39;s time to become real pirates, but even that may not be enough to save them.
	Meanwhile the endless War Against the Globes rages across the Earth.  Some feel it&#39;s the Star Patrol&#39;s job to end that conflict, but
neither the Globes, Slimers, or the Human enemies are willing to allow them enough time to act." />
