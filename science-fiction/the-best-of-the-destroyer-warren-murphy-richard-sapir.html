  <title>The Best of the Destroyer - Warren Murphy, Richard Sapir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In combination with the launch of The New Destroyer, brand-new novels continuing this bestselling, action-packed series, Forge is publishing  this omnibus of three of the definitive Destroyer novels. Hand-picked by co-creator and co-author Warren Murphy, these three novels serve as both a revisit to the golden age of the series and a great introduction to what Remo Williams and his Sinanju master, Chiun, have been up to for the past thirty years. Included are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Destroyer: Chinese Puzzle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US President calls upon the service of Remo and Chiun to smash an Asian conspiracy that could lead to a US-China confrontation . . . if the superhuman weapon of destruction fails, it could mean the end of the USA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Destroyer: Slave Safari&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a secret only Chiun knows. America has committed a sin against him he cannot pardon -- and he will not even share it with Remo Williams, the Destroyer, whom he has taught all his skills and loves as a son. Deep in Africa, countless feuds that have blazed for many centuries are quickly being resolved by death and massacre. A massive conspiracy is unearthed surrounding the centuries-old slave trade, and only Remo can unravel it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Destroyer: Assassin&#39;s Playoff&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a brutal fight in the streets of New Jersey, Remo and Chiun find themselves in battle after battle. Their arch-enemy and fellow assassin, the Maestro of Mayhem known as Nuihc, is hoping to knock out his competition. It all comes to a boil in Chiun&#39;s hometown in North Korea as the Destroyer finds himself in a fight to the death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
