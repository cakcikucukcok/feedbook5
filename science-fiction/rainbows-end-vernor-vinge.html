  <title>Rainbows End - Vernor Vinge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Four time Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge has taken readers to the depths of space and into the far future in his bestselling novels &lt;i&gt;A Fire Upon the Deep&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Deepness in the Sky&lt;/i&gt;. Now, he has written a science-fiction thriller set in a place and time as exciting and strange as any far-future world: San Diego, California, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Gu is a recovering Alzheimer&#39;s patient. The world that he remembers was much as we know it today. Now, as he regains his faculties through a cure developed during the years of his near-fatal decline, he discovers that the world has changed and so has his place in it. He was a world-renowned poet. Now he is seventy-five years old, though by a medical miracle he looks much younger, and he&#39;s starting over, for the first time unsure of his poetic gifts. Living with his son&#39;s family, he has no choice but to learn how to cope with a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum, layers of reality built on digital views seen by a single person or millions, depending on your choice. But the consensus reality of the digital world is available only if, like his thirteen-year-old granddaughter Miri, you know how to wear your wireless access--through nodes designed into &lt;i&gt;smart&lt;/i&gt; clothes--and to see the digital context--through &lt;i&gt;smart&lt;/i&gt; contact lenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With knowledge comes risk. When Robert begins to re-train at Fairmont High, learning with other older people what is second nature to Miri and other teens at school, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world where every computer chip has Homeland Security built-in, this conspiracy is something that baffles even the most sophisticated security analysts, including Robert&#39;s son and daughter-in law, two top people in the U.S. military. And even Miri, in her attempts to protect her grandfather, may be entangled in the plot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Robert becomes more deeply involved in conspiracy, he is shocked to learn of a radical change planned for the UCSD Geisel Library; all the books there, and worldwide, would cease to physically exist. He and his fellow re-trainees feel compelled to join protests against the change. With forces around the world converging on San Diego, both the conspiracy and the protest climax in a spectacular moment as unique and satisfying as it is unexpected. This is science fiction at its very best, by a master storyteller at his peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
