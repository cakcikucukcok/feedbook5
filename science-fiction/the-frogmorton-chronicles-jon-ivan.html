They set up a forward base on a convenient asteroid and monitor the trade rote. One day while monitoring they observe a vessel acting suspiciously, and eventually identify that it has attacked a vessel as it enters space on the trade route, they assume that this is not appropriate conduct and go to the assistance of the vessel. After taking out the attacker they identify six survivors in the aft compartment, they haul the hulk clear of the vessel and transfer the survivor to provide them with medical aid. Whilst they are providing the aid ndr is able to thought read them to acquire information on their system and its language; which allows Angel to become reasonably conversant with the structure of the language. They also discover that the survivors were captives held hostage on the vessel to ensure it had not been sabotaged. ndr recruits them as base staff and angel contacts the vessel which turns out to be a tube runner carrying passengers in transit from the Faal system to the Clondone system. They inform the captain that they are about to tow the hulk back to their base and will return later to see if he needs further assistance. Once they have and installed their new staff the Faal agree to see if they can do provisional repairs on the vessel and improve the base whilst ndr returns to assist the tube runner. When ndr arrives back he identifies that they need a tow back to their port of origin in Faal system which ndr agrees to provide. When he finally enters Terminus space (the Faal port of origin) he is intercepted by Geet- tem-fin a Faal Mage on patrol guarding the entry point. Angel rapidly establishes contact with Geet-tems inboard sentient and establishes that it is also female personality as is its Bio; Angel and Faal-doe hit it of big time, and patch Geet-tem through to ndr; once it has been established that they are both Mages they agree to mind link and ndr explains the situation to Geet-tem who promptly arranges backup and clears him to tow the Runner in.
