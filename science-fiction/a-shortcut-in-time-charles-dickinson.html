  <title>A Shortcut in Time - Charles Dickinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charles Dickinson&#39;s novels and short stories have won widespread acclaim for their deft characterization, humanity, and humor. Newsday described him as &quot;a writer thoroughly in command of his art,&quot; while the Chicago Tribune wrote &quot;he can surprise us at almost every turn.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Dickinson slips beyond the bounds of mundane realism to create a poignant fantasy that bears comparison to the work of Jack Finney and Jonathan Carroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Euclid, Illinois, is a town of many shortcuts, between houses, through orchards, and across fields. Josh Winkler, a local artist and longtime resident, knows these irregular pathways well, but is thoroughly taken aback when a hasty dash down a familiar walk deposits him fifteen minutes in the past--literally. At first, Josh is more intrigued than alarmed by this accidental time travel. Then a lost young woman appears, claiming to be from 1908 . . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As his life, his family, his town, and even history itself begin to unravel, Josh gradually realizes that his only salvation may lie in A Shortcut in Time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Dickinson has written a moving and unforgettable book about the way the past can affect the present as well as, sometimes, the other way around. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
