Now he and nine others &amp;ndash; the remnant of a scout team &amp;ndash; have been tasked with ending this undeclared war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, only ten to turn the tide of death and destruction. Only ten who are to rescue the victims from the fallen cities. Only ten who must locate the valley where the primitives gather to prepare their campaigns. And only ten who must bring peace to this world. How can ten defeat the combined might of the primitive alliance? This is the question they are facing; knowing if they fail it is over. And that failure will lead to the survivors being forced into the herds and slavery, leading them to pain, suffering, misery, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And thusly&amp;nbsp;the stage is set, leaving them desperate to solve these life-threatening issues . . .&amp;nbsp;leaving them &lt;em&gt;desperate to survive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
