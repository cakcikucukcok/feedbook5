      <meta name="description" content="Is there really such a thing as hearing your calling? It has been said that we all
have one. If so, will we know when our calling has arrived, even more importantly,
will we know how to deal with it. There is also a saying that you are a product
of your environment. If that is the case, does that mean if you are raised in an
environment that is associated with a lot of violence such as gangs, shooting
and killings that will be your destiny also, some say that is the case. In this story,
Jaw-long and Frank, (both products of their environment), had been involved in
the gangs, shootings and killings, will crush that saying, and will prove all the
nay-sayers wrong. And along with their family and friends they will hear their
calling, and they will succeed in fulfilling it. And any person or persons, that try
to interfere or derail what they are trying to do, or messes with their family, will
regret it.
Jaw-long escapes the Chinese Mafia.
Jaw-long, a master ninja assassin, and his best friend Tao are sitting in a
warehouse discussing getting out of the Chinese Mafia. The problem is, the only
way out is death for you and your family. Unbeknownst to them, Yingpei Fong,
who resented Jaw-long, and is the son of the leader of the Chinese Mafia, was
hiding in the shadows listening. After they discovered his presence, he tried to
run to inform his father, and Jaw-long caught up to him. A fight ensued, Yingpei
was killed and panic takes over Jaw-long and Tao. Jaw-long concluded that
now is a better time than ever to escape the Chinese Mafia, so he disappears.
Jaw-long meets with Frank in America, and an unbreakable bond is formed.
Jaw-long, his wife and son, now lives with Frank, his wife and their three kids.
They consider themselves family not friends and they have a very strong spiritual
bond. The fact that they are different races is not a factor at all. Along with their
friends, they now own the largest martial arts school in the area, as well as, a
very successful clothing store.
The Chinese Mafia catches up to Jaw-long more than twenty years later and
wants him dead. But they would have to go through his family in America to get
to him.
Then Chinese Mafia discovers Jaw-long is alive and well and come for him in
America. While Jaw-long and Frank are away, the Chinese Mafia attacks their
martial arts school, killing a family member and seriously injuring three others.
Franks wife is poisoned while Jaw-longs wife is kidnapped and taken back to
China. The Chinese Mafia has made a huge mistake, as they will soon find out;
you dont mess with their family." />
