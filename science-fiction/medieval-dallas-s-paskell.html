  <title>Medieval - Dallas S. Paskell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Taj Odin Xavier returns home to find his father dead and his king ready to surrender the key to the city-state hes always called home.  His friends are all dead.  But remnants from his travels and things found and earned along the way push the renegade army threatening Eternis to decimation.  After saving the city from capture, Taj turns his aggression towards the city that let his father down; the same man that spent a lifetime serving it.  He cast down the churches of all faiths, save those of Draconic origin.  He allows the Draconic Order to remain prevalent in the city due to it being the dragons that come down to help him.  After, he focuses his newfound aggression towards the Republic of New Magic, more specifically Marko Kane, the killer of King Gerears eldest son.  Taj tries to utilize what heart he has left to rekindle the romance between him and Destiny but an act he deems as betrayal is too much for him.  With Destiny forcing him to stay out of it, he orders a newfound ally to execute the culprit.  With matters settled in Eternis, he and his new allies set sail for the Republic of New Magic; Runethedians first outpost against the unending ships and armies of the New Threat, sometimes called the Northern Threat.  At first, he plans only to stay long enough to avenge his kings eldest son.  But then the war begins to consume him and the things the Father Vampire left inside him begin to writhe in his chest once again.  This proves to Taj hes not fully gone.  But those powers prove useful in the fight against the New Threat.  In the end, he ultimately decides to sail to the heart of the beast in hopes of either securing a truce or ending its life.  With every passing day, Taj Odin Xavier loses more of his humanity.  Will any of it remain once the war against the New Threat is over?  That is, assuming he lives of course." />
