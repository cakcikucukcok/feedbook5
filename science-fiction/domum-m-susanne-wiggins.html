  <title>Domum - M Susanne Wiggins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What a curious world this is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domum, a place where herds of unisus graze on mountaintop meadows, where gardons nest in volcanic caves, where whisper birds mimic your thoughts, where ovis-size bufo live and die in the lagoon-dotted coral reef islands of the middle ocean, and where sociable raiyfs flit about and speak a language so ancient only they know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alec Ellison Abbott enjoys his newfound liberty on Domum, savors the freedom this world affords him in ways that Gamma never could, but it is the temporary calm before a storm of chaos and destruction. He becomes a complex creature, a killing machine, whose life on Gamma suddenly seems idyllic as it reflects back at him through the familiar eyes of Margaret Meg Arcana. An enigmatic creature in her own right, Meg understands the composition of Alec&amp;rsquo;s fracturing soul &amp;ndash; she made a clandestine pact long ago to nurture it and bring it to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambitious and ruthless, General Arden Raynor represents the East American government. It is his duty to form a coalition with the people of Domum, by force if necessary. His mission &amp;ndash; his very mind &amp;ndash; warps to abject entropy. A war is coming to Domum. War is ugly, as few ever come and go without massacre. Atrocities will happen, brutalities endured, and death is inevitable&amp;hellip; but there are those who will do whatever it takes to rid Domum of the oppressive regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With tyranny on its way to choke Domum&amp;rsquo;s survival, geological tabula rasa is headed for Earth to sever the head from the beast. It is the beginning of many ends, and the end of a beginning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
