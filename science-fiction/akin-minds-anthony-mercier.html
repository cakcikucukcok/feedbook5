  <title>Akin Minds - Anthony Mercier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There exists a world much like our own. One parallel to the Spirit World. People much like ourselves fight everyday to keep both worlds from plummeting into darkness. They are called Defenders.
The Spirit World is divided into many smaller worlds, each which follows its own path and are vastly different from one another. When these worlds start straying from their predetermined path, what chaos could unfold? It is a Defender&#39;s job to stop it.
Ryoku Dragontalen, one such boy, is thrown into an adventure to save both worlds. What began as one small task, to save his friend, quickly escalates into something much more. Where the laws are simply not laws anymore, he journeys alongside gods and many significant people, all seemingly with intricate involvement in his foggy past, to find much more than what they initially set out for.
Follow Ryoku and his newfound friends on a journey through the Spirit World, packed with mystery, action, romance, adventure, and the sense of something untold as the very gods step forward." />
