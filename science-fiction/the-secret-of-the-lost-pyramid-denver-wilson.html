  <title>The Secret of the Lost Pyramid - Denver Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of a man who has devoted his life to the pursuit of science, and the security of verifiable fact, devoid of faith. His world is abruptly shattered, and his mind strained to its outer limits by encounters with the myths he has so furiously labored to debunk: Angles and Demons. He is perpetually haunted by ever increasing doubts as the world in which he could never believe is thrust into his face.&lt;/P&gt;
Dimensions collide in this riveting tale as demons hunt for the only person who can stop them from destroying all life on the planet, known only as &lt;I&gt;The Prophesized One&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
Up against an evil that the world has never before seen, Dakota Smith (Cody) finds himself standing at the edge of the abyss as the Secret of the Lost Pyramid is revealed.&lt;/P&gt;
This critically acclaimed piece packs excitement and intensity akin to an Indiana Jones saga, with the heightened element of supernatural beings in a heated battle for the fate of the world. Once you open this book, you will not rest until you have navigated the twists and turns of this plot and discover for yourself the Secret of the Lost Pyramid." />
