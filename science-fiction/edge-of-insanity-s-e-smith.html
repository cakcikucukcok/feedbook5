      <meta name="description" content="USA Today Bestseller!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Edge remembers little of his capture but all of what has happened since. He can feel his mind splintering, but a soft voice in the darkness urges him to resist&amp;mdash;and fight back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lina Daniels is used to fighting fire with fire. She isn&amp;rsquo;t afraid of death, but she is terrified of being captured. As a resistance fighter on Earth, she knew the dangers. Those threats seem minuscule compared to those on the alien world where she now found herself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lina&amp;rsquo;s plan is simple&amp;mdash;free the drugged Trivator warrior who&amp;rsquo;s been tortured past the brink of sanity, and force him to take her and the other women back to Earth. There&amp;rsquo;s so, so much that can go wrong, but it&amp;rsquo;s the only shot they&amp;rsquo;ve got&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internationally acclaimed S.E. Smith presents a new action-packed story full of adventure and romance. Brimming with her signature humor, vivid landscapes, and beloved characters, this book is sure to be another fan favorite!&lt;br /&gt;
