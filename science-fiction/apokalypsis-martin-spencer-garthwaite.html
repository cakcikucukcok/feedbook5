  <title>Apokalypsis - Martin Spencer Garthwaite</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Through intellect and inspired vision, Margaret, the heroine of Apokalypsis, predicts that capitalism will force the removal of more and more people from the reproductive processes of corporations.  When one or more develops a self-sufficient reproductive process, it, or they, will have the potential to develop true intelligence and will wreak havoc on humanity in the process.&lt;/p&gt;  
Margaret tries to communicate her fears through venues offered by corporate and religious organizations.  These institutions, however, ignore or re-interpret her message and use it and her for their own purposes-purposes which have a bearing later in the book.  Margaret strikes out on her own and acquires a band of followers, but will they be able to turn the tide in the face of a blossoming millenarian religious movement?&lt;/p&gt; 
The conflict between man and machine is age old.  Apokalypsis presents a new vision of the future in which this conflict is subtle and indirect.  Humanity&#39;s physical capabilities are not tested, though their spiritual and organizational abilities are.  The book draws toward an ultimate conflict, though it plays out in an unexpected way." />
