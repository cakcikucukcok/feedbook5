  <title>The Coalition - Bob Avis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tuebor was the most advanced civilization in our sector of the galaxy and they willingly shared their technology with most of the civilizations they encountered during their space explorations.  This led to the formation of the Hocage Alliance.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	The Vate decided that the Tuebor led Alliance would be an easy acquisition and started a war.  However, they underestimated the resistance of the other members of the Alliance and found themselves in a vicious stalemate.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	The Balekian Empire engaged the Vate during their conquest of all civilizations they encountered.  The Vate realized that they could not defeat the Empire, therefore, asked the Alliance to join them in an effort to defeat a enemy who eventually would consume the Alliance.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	After thousands of years of war, a truce was finally signed which eventually led to the formation of THE COALITION.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Tueborian influence within THE COALITION began to erode and they sought help from the remnants of the genetically related colony established on Earth 66 million years ago.  This led to the 12.3 light-year separation of a teenage girl and her parents.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Jackie and Bob Cavish were supposedly killed in a car crash.  After the initial shock of her parents deaths, Denise Cavish questions police about several incidents surrounding the accident that doesnt make sense including the unauthorized cremation of the bodies.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	The disappearance of Denises best friend Kim Longley seems to be unrelated to the Cavishs apparent deaths.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Acting on her own, Denise follows a lead that takes her to a remote fishing cabin in Montana where she almost kills the man responsible for reuniting the family.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Once together the family helps the Tueborians and THE COALITION in dealing with the Genigans and Ammonoids in Book I; the Imini, Esortians, and Reptilians in Book II; and the United Reptilian Systems, the Plasma People and the Cosmic Creature in Book III.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	  The Genigans and especially the Reptilians tend to settle any disputes with war.  The Imini are always in constant flight for survival but will fight to eat.  The Esortians chase the Imini throughout the galaxy and multi- dimensions while attacking anyone who helps their foe.  The Ammonoids are reluctant to share and prefer to control situations through the non-confrontational use of their technology.  The Plasma People and the Cosmic Creature arewell  far out.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Book III concludes with the Day Of Truth and the final chance for Earth to join THE COALITION.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	The story gives an awesome sense of appreciation for each species own very special but trivial place in this magnificent mysterious multidimensional ever-evolving universe.  They learned to face issues far greater than their own personal needs.  As a group they gradually learned that they must bind together for mutual protection and prosperity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	THE COALITION provides adventure, mystery, humor and a touch of love all developed by the gradual blending of characters and species.  It also provides some thoughts concerning the following questions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Did you ever wonder why the Chicxulub impact was so amazingly effective in wiping out all dinosaurs on Earth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Why Earth has humanoids of various colors?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Which, if any, humanoids are indigenous to Earth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Why media exposure to science fiction has dramatically increased during the past 25 years?" />
