  <title>Misunderstood: Healing Jason Sutter - Jay Sherfey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is December of 1962 when a car rolls down a tree-lined street in a bedroom community south of Philadelphia. Slumped in the back seat is thirteen-year-old Jason Sutter, unaware he will soon be delivered to his foster family. As Lydia and Frank DeBois open the door to welcome Jason and the social worker, they have no idea of the kind of power they are about to let into their home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnosed as potentially violent with severe psychotic tendencies, Jason has a future that seems uncertain at best. Now victim to his foster parents deliberate experiments with his medicine, Jason has already missed two years of school. But even more perplexing are the newfound mental abilities he has discovered over the past few months. It turns out that Jason is a gifted telepath who now must claw his way out of the darkness of mind-numbing drugs to determine how he can use his physical and mental superpowers for the good of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jason makes friends and discovers enemies, he enters a larger world wielding his psychic powerscompletely unaware that he is a medical miracle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
