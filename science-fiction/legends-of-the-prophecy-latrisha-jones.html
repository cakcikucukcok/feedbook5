  <title>Legends of the Prophecy - LaTrisha Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Enemy
The Fajarah, powerful evil beings, have enslaved the inhabitants
of Sonaria. Their only concern is self-preservation. Their goal
is universal dominion. They will stop at nothing to get what they
want. No race is beyond their reach. No Planet is safe.
Hope
The Prophecy, penned by The Holy One Himself, foretells of seven
children who shall defeat the Fajarah and crush the Dynasty.
As the ages-old prophecy unfolds, seven children are born as
the three moons of Sonaria eclipse the Sun. In danger from the
moment they take their fi rst breath of life, the newborn fugitives
are whisked away by their parents to a hidden ship. To save not
only their children, but the future of Sonaria, seven sets of parents
risk their very lives to fl ee to a ship especially designed to escape
to the sanctity of Earth.
But only six of the children make it to the ship.
Of one thing the prophecy is clear: only the combined strength
of all Seven will be enough to defeat the Fajarah and destroy
the Dynasty. Without the Seventh Child, the future of Sonaria is
doomed. With six of The Seven headed to Earth, will Earth be
next on the Dynastys list?" />
