  <title>Blooming Flower Rising - Annette Greer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Blooming Flower Rising takes you into the not-so-far future where earthquakes and deadly sulfur gases have irrefutably damaged the Earth. The year is 2102, the skies are dark, and rain constantly falls on Earth. The Earth has not seen sunlight for many years, and only humans remain on Earth.
Blooming Flower Rising is a young teenage girl living in the province of Hawaii with her Mama, Papa, and little brother. Her dream is to feel sunlight on her face and to grow flowers, which have long been extinct. Her Mama travel all over the world, selling gas masks, and her Papa stays home to raise her and her brother. She yearns to fit in to society, but a classmate named Morning Glory bullies her relentlessly because Blooming is the only person in the world who has blond hair in a world of brown-haired people. The day of the annual dance at the learning center, scientists predict the sun will come out for a short time. During the dance, an announcement made by the principal of the learning center broadcasts that the sun is coming out, and all the students run outside to see the sun for the first time, and maybe the only time in their lives, but where is Blooming?" />
