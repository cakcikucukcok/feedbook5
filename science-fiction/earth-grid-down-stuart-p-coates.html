  <title>Earth Grid Down - Stuart P. Coates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Peter Bradshaw hates technology. He knows hes a throwback to a simpler time, and yet, he also knows he needs the technology he hates to follow his passion. Hes spent the last two decades studying ancient artifacts, specifically Stonehenge, the statues of Easter Island, and the Seven Wonders of the Worldbut most importantly, the Great Pyramid in Egypt.
Hes just made an amazing discovery. He found a crystal with the capability of moving objects of great weight, which might explain how the pyramids were built. Hes headed back to America to share his findings, but once there, he realizes an eleven-foot-tall woman with ill intent is following him. Then, the entire worlds power grid suddenly fails.
An unstoppable force of nature has wiped out all advanced technology in the blink of an eye. The world has simultaneously crashed. Is it possible that whatever Peter discovered in Egypt could reboot civilization? He needs the help of the mysterious woman whos on his tailbut is she willing to help, or will the Earth become a place of darkness and death?" />
