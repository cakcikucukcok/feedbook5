  <title>The Barber&#39;s Chair - Nana Boateng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Barber&#39;s Chair the place all men go to begin their interview process to start their weekend off to begin a road trip to get ready for that wedding to begin a new life on campus. The barber does not just give one a cut, he is forever the beginning of any event in a gentleman&#39;s life. This has been a barber&#39;s place in society since time immemorial, however few people know of the barber&#39;s other role a purveyor of tales. Some might label him a psychologist, a soothsayer or a psychiatrist, but that most of the time is not the case. You see, a barber is probably privy to more tales than any of the aforementioned professionals because he does not have to ask to receive. Anyone who sits in a barber&#39;s chair has a story to tell and these stories are a byproduct of not only forgetting that someone is indeed listening, but a willingness to share with someone who is detached from the situation and will not be judgmental. These stories are also as diverse as the people telling them: bankers, servicemen, janitors, CEOs, lawyers, doctors, Hispanics, Caucasians, African Americans, Indians, Africans, you name it- they all have a story to tell. These are their stories" />
