  <title>Born Under a Wandering Star - Jon Peter Quill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The universe is a hostile place for Angel Stardancer and her brother Sage. Her people were massacred; she and Sage enslaved. Fleeing, they find work as freelance security agents. A team of scientists need them to protect their plans and equipment. She soon discovers the real reason they were hired. Part of that technology-plans to what may be the most dangerous weapon ever created-has fallen into the wrong hands. She finds herself in over her head when the government goons show up with the weapon primed to kill. Unable to sabotage the weapon itself, she seeks the aid of supposed allies. To get the job done, she&#39;ll have to trust dubious men. Even with their help, her people are outnumbered and outgunned. Her wits, her steady hand with a gun, her specially modified ship, and this band of outlaws may not be enough. Coming out of this alive doesn&#39;t seem possible. There&#39;s no choice. If she&#39;s ever going to have a peaceful place to call home she first has to keep the universe from blowing up." />
