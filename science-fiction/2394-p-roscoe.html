&lt;p&gt;Those who were born in the Before Time hold indistinct memories of their past, recalling vague images of their planet and the destruction that rained down on it over time by the uncontrolled greed of the elite upper class.

As new allegiances are formed, unexplored feelings that most of the inhabitants have never experienced begin surfacing. One woman emerges as her clans unwilling leader and struggles desperately to avoid the mistakes of the past by setting out on a quest to discover the worlds true history. In searching for peace, she finds herself in a puzzling relationship with a younger woman as they explore the roots of their past, the mysterious planet, and their newfound feelings for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
