  <title>Cave Lupus - Christian MARTIN</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thousands of years before this story begins, in a world rife with war, savagery and power, a prophesy was made, one amongst many of that time. Then it was forgotten, but prophesies have a tendency to be forgotten, do they not? Yet, prophesies have a better chance of being realised when forgotten than when the two legs try to favour it or to mingle with its natural development. This scroll tells the story of how our family became involved with its onset, development, and conclusion. This is my saga. I almost started this scroll with the classical once upon a time, but this story is on-going, and you too will be part of it, writing your own saga in time. Sons, Daughters, learn that the past may guide, but must never stifle your thinking. Nothing we hold dear is permanent, and this is right, for permanence equals stability, leading to disappearance.
Let us begin our trip...
Uncle Silver Wolf
Nearly eight thousand years after the Nuclear Cataclysm threw back civilization to the cave age, society is fighting its way up the ladder again. The political structure matches the Middle Age, with Kingdoms, Trade Orders, Roads of Initiation, and Symbols of Mastery. There exists one huge historical difference: Each six-year old Child is taken from home by the Diviners, travels for a year to get hands-on work experience before being incorporated into an Order for life. Another issue is the effects of the Cataclysm on life: numerous mutant life-forms have emerged, while huge swaths of the world have become inhospitable. Thus begins the story of Harold, Companion Ironsmith, and how he discovers his unexpected heritage." />
