A political group has taken control over the entire fleet of Russian atomic bombs and plans to blow up an entire third world country or Russia. The diplomat has vital information that the Pentagon scientists need to stop the destruction. The doctors and scientists have about seventy-two hours to revive the diplomat before he becomes brain dead. They are faced with two problems: (1) the political group had infected the Russian diplomat with an injection of the AIDS virus; (2) they cant obtain vital information containing the time the political group plans to attack until the diplomat regains consciousness. Another enormous dilemma the entire world is faced with is: If these atomic bombs exploded, the radiation would affect the entire world, contaminating the atmosphere, polluting the water and sending the world into a nuclear winter. In the process a technique is implemented that allows scientists to communicate directly with the AIDS virus. The virus is asked: Where did you come from? The answer is astounding." />
