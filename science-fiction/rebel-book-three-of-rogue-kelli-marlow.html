      <meta name="description" content="War is coming, the likes of which her kind has never seen, and a whole string of firsts lay ahead for Melina Petrescu and her two handsome companions. A rebel force looks to her for guidance as she helps her father search for her deranged little sister. Lance struggles with his inner demons as he takes on two new titles...one of commander and one of makers, helping Chris adjust to his new immortality. Chris is saddled with a new body, a new existence, and a myriad of intense new urges he&#39;s never experienced. Battles wage on, both amongt Mel&#39;s people and within her own divided heart. Everything has changed and everything will change again. Blood will spill and hearts will break before all is said and done. New friendships will emerge and old alliances will mend as the rebellion prepares for the final confrontation, knowing they won&#39;t all survive. The question is, when the blood stops flowing and the war is over, who will be left standing?" />
