      <meta name="description" content="After centuries of intercontinental war, chaos, and reconstruction, Earth wants to reassert itself on the planet it built and colonized at great cost nearly a millenium before...Novus. Abandoned during Earth&#39;s woes, Novus has learned to exist on its own and now rejects the mother planet&#39;s ancient claims. It now must decide how far it will go to maintain its independence; fully aware that it has developed a society where war no longer exists. Huperum has taken its place. Yet, it too extracts the ultimate price few are willing to pay. One who does is Keef Terrason, determined to restore the lost honor and prominence of his people, Pearthia, the new world&#39;s first colonists. Standing in his way is Pendar Loriat, an Akasian, bred and trained to rule, descendant of Novus&#39; first Huper, Pendar the Great. Into this setting arrives Earth&#39;s new Consul General, Sean Lewis, sent to Novus to convince the current Huper to meet Earth&#39;s demands. Earth does not want conflict, but is determined to take what is not willingly given. It believes it has paid to high a price not to." />
