  <title>Why Go to the Deep End of the Ocean? - Andrew Charles Swarm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why Go To The Deep End of The Ocean? is about two guys, Stone Rainy and Jim
Toppy who have been best friends since high school. They love to go fishing in
the Pacific Ocean, drink beer and talk about their girlfriends.
The story unfolds with Stone and Jim out-on the Pacific Ocean in Stone&#39;s deep
sea fishing boat. Jim mentions that he thought Gwen was falling -in love with
him and that he was going to propose to her that evening. Stone caked Jim if
he loved her or was she pregnant. Jim gets furious, hits Stone almost ruining
their longtime friendship. Things simmer down and the two guys apologized
to each other.
When they returned to shore and to Stone&#39;s house, things took another turn.
After Jim left to go to his own house, Gwen shows up at Stone&#39;s house starting
to flirt with him. They started kissing and making out when Stone heard
someone out in the living room. Gwen went to the bathroom and he went to
see who was there. Sure enough, it was Jim who had come looking for Gwen
to take her to dinner so he could propose to her. Later that evening, Stone and
Sarah went out on his boat to make love. They made love in the boat&#39;s cabin,
and then went up on deck to make love under the moon and stars. Fate had
other plans, for while walking towards the railing Sarah slipped on a puddle
of water falling underneath the railing and into the dark water. Stone jumps in
after her; but couldn&#39;t save her.
Gwen comes over to Stone&#39;s to console him when she finds out about Sarah&#39;s
untimely death. Jim finds out and does something drastic. Gwen and Stone
start seeing each other after she and Jim break up; but fate steps in again. The
story ends with investigators going to Jim&#39;s house finding his note." />
