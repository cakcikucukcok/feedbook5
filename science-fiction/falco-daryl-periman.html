  <title>Falco - Daryl Periman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;      We humans fantasize about the ability to break the laws of physics, yet there are creatures in the real world that appear to do just that! The peregrine falcon is one such creature; displaying power dives that seem to defy Newtons laws of motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The story of FALCO is like light. Light sometimes behaves like a wave, and sometimes behaves like a particle, but is neither. FALCO is sometimes a story about a falcon, but its also a story about people, the environment, our fears, and about how good and evil are sometimes not clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; What if you could get inside the mind of a young peregrine, one that, like most teenagers, stands at the brink of self-identity? An animal loaded with killer instinct, but yet insecure due to the fact that she did not grow up in the wild. When faced with the freedom she inwardly longed for, she finds the wilderness charm to be packaged with complexity, terror, and friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Blurr is the falcon that will face the ultimate hunter of another world, and may be the only one to save our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; FALCO reads as if it were a movie. I think that my science background, my years of working with teens, and skillful science fiction stories like X-Files, Jurassic Park, and Independence Day influenced me greatly for this book. Im sure those stories, and more, helped boost my hybridization of this adventure with its host of flawed, but mostly well-intentioned, characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Be on the look-out for FALCO II, coming in the fall of 2015!!&lt;/p&gt;
