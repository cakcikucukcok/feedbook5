      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the age of sixteen, Caleb lost his father to an accident while fishing on the Sea of Galilee. Now at the age of seventeen, Caleb has taken responsibility for supporting his mother and younger brother. As his dreams and visions of the Lord continue, Caleb through prayer decides to accept the Lord&amp;#39;s calling and locate the crown of thorns. He knows it will be a long journey filled with perils and tribulations; however, he also knows this journey will be filled with the love of the Lord as he meets new friends and is given the opportunity to spread the word to the lost. His brother wishes to join him; however, he is at too young of an age, and his mother grows concerned, knowing the dangers he will face. Her faith in the Lord and in her son will not stop him from seeing the miracles through his own eyes as he accepts the calling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
