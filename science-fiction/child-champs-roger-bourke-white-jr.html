  <title>Child Champs - Roger Bourke White Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to life in the world of 2112 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mankind has won: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o The population bomb is defused and the population is down to 7 billion from a peak of 9 billion in 2050. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o People can have their cake -- thanks to nanotechnology and advanced manufacturing, Earth&#39;s resources are not going to run out.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o Humans and robots are in peaceful coexistence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahlia Rose is a very human being with very human desires. She wants a baby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is New York City in 2112 and baby making isn&#39;t birds and bees simple -- there are dozens of ways to do it now. And the world around her is... complicated. How is she going to &quot;stay on target&quot; and make her dream come true? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is prosperous, but that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t problems and heartbreaks. Hard choices still have to be made, people can still make tragic mistakes, and unfeeling bureaucracy can still grind people up and spit them out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journey with Dahlia and the other students of Child Champs as they experience triumph and tragedy, heroism and heartbreak, outrage and oppression the 22nd century way. &lt;/p&gt;" />
