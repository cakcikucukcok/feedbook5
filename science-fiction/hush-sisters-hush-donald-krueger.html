  <title>Hush Sisters Hush - Donald Krueger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Geoffrey Downs seems to be ageless. His biography would suggest it, but when an automobile accident puts him in the hospital, he realizes his vulnerability. He seeks out an investigative book author to help find his origin. She is highly skeptical but finds herself in a lengthy interview with him that triggers her curious mind. She begins a search that evokes more and more intrigue. At an old Catholic orphanage in Worcester, England, she finds another clue. But now she needs his help that involves travel to England and France. The charm of Paris throws them into a romantic affair. They try to disregard it so they can pursue answers, but their attraction for one another is always waiting in the shadows. Again, they go back to the abbey where secrets live only as myths to be passed from one generation of nuns to another, always keeping alive the mysterious arrival of six babies at their doorstep three hundred years ago. 
A message is revealed at the orphanage that six babies were mysteriously left at the orphanage some three hundred years ago. So is there another world like ours? Are there more ageless persons like Geoffrey? Sarah is determined to find out. She scours England for months and returns to Chicago empty-handed. Then a very unusual source discovers another ageless person." />
