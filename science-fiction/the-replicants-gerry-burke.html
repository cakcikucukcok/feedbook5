  <title>The Replicants - Gerry Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;THEY COME IN PEACE, OR SO THEY SAY.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Planet Schmoo is so far into outer space it is the last stop before heaven. When a cataclysmic seismic intervention decimates their world, the Schmooans look for refuge on Earth and a continuation of the lifestyle to which they are accustomed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Homeland security agent Calvin Swift and his girl-friend, the alluring Alicia Angelico, already have their hands full with interstellar visitors. The once-in-a-millennium Intergalactic Games are in full swing and now they are alerted to alien refugees and their potential to replicate at will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From the first splashdown in the Hudson River, the visitors also make their presence felt in France, Switzerland, Indonesia and Mongolia. These creatures are smart, inventive and very athletic, and when their intentions become obvious, even President Daphne Doolittle is at a loss. She doesnt know what to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This fast-moving humorous narrative pits the superior intellect of the aliens against the gritty determination of one man and his lady, with a little help from his British counterpart, the suave MI6 agent, Bulldog Bartholomew. With the fate of the world at stake, who else would you turn to?&lt;/p&gt;" />
