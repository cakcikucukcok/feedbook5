  <title>Unintended Consequences - Kevin Pellegrino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        A single dad, wrongly convicted of murdering his ex-wife, is killed during a prison yard fight.  Years later it is discovered that his ex-wife&#39;s
        boyfriend was the murderer
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        40 years later technology advances and man has created the ability to travel back in time.  Nick Ryan, the son of the murdered parents is now a
        successful corporate attorney working for LexiCon Industries, with one primary objective.  LexiCon has developed the top secret technology and wants
        congress to approve human experimentation in time travel.  Politicians take sides, some fearful of the ripple effect of time travel, others anxious to
        take advantage of the power it can deliver.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        Lesley Powell works for a division of the justice department and after much debate is the special agent assigned to be the human experiment.  Her
        mission; fix an injustice that happened 40 years ago; save the life of Nick&#39;s mother or help defend his father of the wrongful conviction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        Knowledge of the future should be an advantage for Lesley.  However, man can not be all knowing and her trip back in time leads her down a path she
        could not have predicted.
