  <title>On to the Unknown - Sidney Sistrunk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Chief, a dying billionaire, has dreams as big as his net worth. Before he dies, hell see the biggest one come true. A lifetime of observing the sky has rewarded him with a destinationand now nothing will stop him from seeing his dreams brought to life. Hes found what he believes is the sister star to his own sun, and he fully expects to find inhabitable planets there. He has committed himself to financing an interstellar expedition, and now all he needs is a crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is building a ship for the journeya ship that hes convinced can reach half the speed of light. If his math is on target, the round trip to this new planet should take roughly twenty-eight years. But for the crew, the time will pass as in a dream as they safely hibernate in freezers designed for the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has certain specific requirements of his crew, but first he must find a recruitersomeone to assemble the crew of his dreams. The rewards are enticing, the Chief believes. His crew will be the first humans to walk on an alien world, and on top of that, they will be handsomely paid. So the search begins for single, educated, and adventurous souls who want to go on the adventure of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like most grand dreams, things to do not always go as planned. Can his crew save the Chiefs dreamsand their lives?&lt;/p&gt;" />
