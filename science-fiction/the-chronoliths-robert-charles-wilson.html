  <title>The Chronoliths - Robert Charles Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Scott Warden is a man haunted by the past--and soon to be haunted by the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early-twenty-first-century Thailand, Scott is an expatriate slacker. Then, one day, he inadvertently witnesses an impossible event: the violent appearance of a 200-foot stone pillar in the forested interior. Its arrival collapses trees for a quarter mile around its base, freezing ice out of the air and emitting a burst of ionizing radiation. It appears to be composed of an exotic form of matter. And the inscription chiseled into it commemorates a military victory--sixteen years in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterwards, another, larger pillar arrives in the center of Bangkok--obliterating the city and killing thousands. Over the next several years, human society is transformed by these mysterious arrivals from, seemingly, our own near future. Who is the warlord &quot;Kuin&quot; whose victories they note? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott wants only to rebuild his life. But some strange loop of causality keeps drawing him in, to the central mystery and a final battle with the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Chronoliths&lt;/i&gt; by Robert Charles Wilson is a 2002 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel and the winner of the 2002 John W. Campbell Memorial Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
