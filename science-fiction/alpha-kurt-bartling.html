      <meta name="description" content="Book 3 of the Balance Series ALPHA completes the thrilling ride started in BALANCE.  The worst possible outcome of their actions against the SuperElite has come to pass.  Michael, alone and lost, searches for reason to carry on, to finish what he and Rena started.  Without her sister and Michael descending into the blackness of his own despair, Meg takes matters into her own hands. Her actions may result in the loss of her own life, or set into motion a series of events no one will see coming. Michael has to make a decision, mourn those he&#39;s lost or protect those left behind. But all is not as it seems, as more is yet to be revealed. Rena&#39;s legacy, Michael&#39;s soul, and the fate of those he cares for, rests on his final confrontation with Takada, and the final action against the Alpha." />
