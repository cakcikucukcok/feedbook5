  <title>The Blue Door - Bryan Whelan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The girl from Broadmeadows never really stood a chance. She was destined to live out her life in abject misery like all the girls from her area. As she faced the inevitable consequence of being arrested, with no other option open to her, she stepped through the blue door. 
Her escape led her on a series of adventures, each one more diabolical than the last. Her true character was tested, and she had to use her streetwise knowledge to get out of one scrape after another. But, all the while, she had one curious inkling in the back of her mind. How to get back home? And did she really want to return to her imminent arrest before the blue door came to be?
Does she escape the never-ending trip that is the blue door? Does she find out who is controlling the door, and what can she do about? How does she get out of this nightmare without returning to another?" />
