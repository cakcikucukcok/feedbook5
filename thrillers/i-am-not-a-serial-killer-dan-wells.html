  <title>I Am Not A Serial Killer - Dan Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Wayne Cleaver is dangerous, and he knows it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s spent his life doing his best not to live up to his potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s obsessed with serial killers, but really doesn&#39;t want to become one. So for his own sake, and the safety of those around him, he lives by rigid rules he&#39;s written for himself, practicing normal life as if it were a private religion that could save him from damnation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead bodies are normal to John. He likes them, actually. They don&#39;t demand or expect the empathy he&#39;s unable to offer. Perhaps that&#39;s what gives him the objectivity to recognize that there&#39;s something different about the body the police have just found behind the Wash-n-Dry Laundromat---and to appreciate what that difference means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, for the first time, John has to confront a danger outside himself, a threat he can&#39;t control, a menace to everything and everyone he would love, if only he could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Wells&#39;s debut novel, &lt;i&gt;I Am Not a Serial Killer&lt;/i&gt;, is the first volume of a trilogy that will keep you awake and then haunt your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
