  <title>The Silent War - Wayne Patrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charlie McShanes world has just collapsed. His parents, John and Mary, are killed in a head-on collision with a drunk driver. Worse, the driver is an illegal alien from Mexico. To keep himself from destitution, Charlie moves back into his parents home in Arizona. And it is then that the silent war begins.&lt;/p&gt;
Already suffering from mental illness, Charlie is pushed to the brink his parents death. His passive racism suddenly roars to full-blown hatred, engulfing friends, neighborhood strays, and the unfortunate Mexican population. As schizophrenia seizes Charlies mind, virtually no one is safe from Charlies wrath. He is now in an undeclared and very personal war of perverted justice and revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
Charlie embarks on a random killing spree and especially targets the Mexican population. Fear and terrorism grip Arizona, and despite the efforts of law enforcement, there is no end in sight until one valiant man determines to stop Charlie, no matter the cost &lt;/p&gt;
Gripping and timely, &lt;i&gt;The Silent War&lt;/i&gt; mixes current political issues with the horrors of mental illness to paint a disturbing picture of misguided vengeance and racism." />
