  <title>Command Plan - C. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Sam Hawk was forced into retirement due to injuries
sustained in the line of duty for the Chicago vice squad, he
thought his days of danger were over. He had planned on just
laying back relaxing and writing his memoirs, but fate had
plans for him.
By happen stance an old friend drafts him back into service,
and before he knows it, hes back up to his eyeballs in the
Chicago gangland. He discovers that theres a powerful
political faction thats trying to take over the U. S.
Government. He stumbles onto some information that
endangers him and his soon to be love connection, librarian
Helen McAllister.
As he delves into this, his investigation leads him all the way
to the white house.
Against all odds, he teams up with Helen and tries to take a
stand against the totalitarian socialistic regime. Can they pull
it off, or will they suffer for trying?
Command Plan, is a fictional account, that shows us just how
slippery the slope is that leads to a dictatorial socialistic
government. It discloses how frail our freedom is and how
easy we make it for our enemies to conquer us from within." />
