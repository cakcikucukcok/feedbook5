  <title>The Colonel’S Son - Ernest Jennings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The serenity of the north Texas lake country shatters after a string of murders devastates the small town of Dillon. The crimes share no motive and no connection except for one detail: each victims right hand has been severed. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It will take two extraordinary men to track down the killer ... &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Will Clayton is a recently retired US Marshall with a legendary career in Texas law enforcement. But hes not interested in temporarily filling the sheriff vacancy until the murders begin. Even with his wealth of forensic knowledge and law enforcement experience, the murderer proves to be an elusive prey. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When Don Taggart returns to his hometown of Dillon, he is a burned-out former Dallas vice detective. He wants to re-evaluate his future and try to balance his personal and professional life. Things are looking up when he reconnects with a former love, but when Sheriff Clayton asks him to join the sheriff s office as a special investigator Taggart cant say no. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Together, these two reluctant heroes join forces to track down one of the most horrendous murderers in Texas history. Both will call upon everything they have and make sacrifices when pain, love and justice collide.&lt;/p&gt;" />
