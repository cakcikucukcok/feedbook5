  <title>Python - Carina Nolan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For the residents of beautiful Palm Harbour, life is a dream. They live in a quaint community on Floridas scenic west coast, where natures beauty is a calming buffer from the stresses of the rest of the world. Its a paradise for all who live and visit there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is all about to change &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of a new resident in the community has everyone on guard. Known only to live and thrive in the everglades, the confirmed presence of the African rock python, the worlds third-largest snake, rattles the community to its core. Deadly and extremely aggressive, the python will do whatever it takes to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the residents fight for survival against this fearsome predator, they are drawn closer as a community. For the very loving and happy marriage of Stella and Adam, the memory of the recent deadly attack in their complex casts a dark and ominous shadow over their time on Honeymoon Island. Can they put the nightmare aside long enough to keep the healthy lust they share? Or will their fear be transformed into an undeniable passion as slick, slithery, and smooth as the monster snake that torments their dreams and lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people of the condominium community, Holly Meadow on scenic Emerald Lake, now live in fear and the shadows of anything that moves. Hell slithers and lust simmers in the steaming, sensuous, and stunned Florida coastal town of Palm Harbour, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;I&gt;Python invites&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/I&gt; you into the nightmare. The battle-scarred residents will soon learn that fear and lust are surprisingly symbiotic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
