In recovery and working as a freelance safecracker for the DEA, the FBI, and any other government agency willing to pay him, Ghost is determined to live clean for the rest of his days. And maybe he could, if the most important person in his life hadn&#39;t gotten into serious financial trouble. To fix it, all Ghost has to do is crack a safe and steal drug money from under the noses of the gangs and the Feds without getting caught. Or killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rudy &#39;Glasses&#39; Reyes runs drugs and cleans up messes for the baddest of bad men. When Ghost hits one of his safes, Glasses must hunt him down or be held accountable. But Glasses is worried about more than just money. The heist puts everything in his life at risk--his livelihood, his freedom, even his family.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Safe - Ryan Gattis</i></b> | Ryan Gattis’ gritty, fast-paced thriller, Safe, hurtles readers toward a shocking conclusion that asks the toughest question of all: how far would you go to protect the ones you love? Ricky ‘Ghost’ Mendoza, Jr. is trying to be good.<br /><b><i>Safe – Ryan Gattis (Author, Host, &amp; Teacher)</i></b> | Safe is the latest book from Ryan Gattis, set over 48 hours with a backdrop of the dark underbelly of Los Angeles and its drugs gangs. Gattis uses two voices to narrate the story, in the form of Ricky “Ghost” Mendoza and Rudy “Glasses” Reyes with a punk rock mixed tape giving the story an old school vibe.<br /><b><i>Safe by Ryan Gattis - Goodreads</i></b> | Ryan Gattis is the latest to step into SoCal noir. Safe is a tale of two criminals: “Ghost” is a nominally reformed safecracker working for the feds and trying to stay straight; “Glasses” is a drug-runner and “cleaner,” younger and more violent. And when Ghost is sucked back into one final, illicit job, Glasses is compelled to defend his territory.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Safe - Ryan Gattis</a> </h3></p><hr/>
