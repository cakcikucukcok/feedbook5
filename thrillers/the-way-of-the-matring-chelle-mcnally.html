She would help them learn and assimilate to their new culture; they would help her move beyond past pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She never dreamed shed meet Commander Sarden Nemarco and fall in love with him, after all she had lost on her own planet. Nemarco can hardly believe it himself. A man of duty, he does not have time for love. Even so, there is something about Shyann that he cant turn away from, and his passionthe Matringcannot be appeased without their love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When one of his kind is found murdered, however, Nemarco finds himself investigating the visitors from Shyanns planet. It is believed that one of the exchange women from space may be to blame. Nemarco cant believe Shyann could be involved.
