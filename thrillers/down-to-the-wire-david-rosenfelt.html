  <title>Down to the Wire - David Rosenfelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A reporter for the Bergen News, Chris Turley could never measure up to his father. Edward Turley, a combination of Bob Woodward and Ernie Pyle, was one of the last great investigative reporters and a difficult man to impress. While stuck covering press conferences and town hall meetings, Chris, his father&#39;s legend in mind, has always dreamed of his own Pulitzer, however unlikely it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then one day while he&#39;s waiting to meet a source, a giant explosion takes out half of an office building next door. Shocked into action, Chris saves five people from the burning building. His firsthand account in the next day&#39;s paper makes him a hero and a celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s not all. The source&#39;s next tip delivers a second headline-grabber of a story for Chris, and suddenly his career is looking a lot more like his dad&#39;s. But then it seems this anonymous source has had a plan for Chris all along, and his luck for being in the right place at the right time is not a coincidence at all. What seemed like a reporter&#39;s dream quickly becomes an inescapable nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Down to the Wire&lt;/i&gt;, David Rosenfelt&#39;s shocking new thriller about an ordinary man who gets exactly what he&#39;s always wanted at a price he can never pay, is an intense thrill ride that will have readers racing through the pages right up to the end.&lt;/p&gt;" />
