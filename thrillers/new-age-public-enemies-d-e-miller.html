  <title>New Age Public Enemies - D. E. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We  pull  up  to her  apartment,  and  Teddy  just  walks  up like  he  owns  the  place. I  didnt  know  what  I  was  getting  myself  into. I  knew  she  told  me  her  ex  was  there  watching  the  kids  so  I  was  hoping  nothing  would  get  started. I  was  a  city  boy  going  to  a  hick  town. I  had  to  come  though  there  was  something  about  this  women  that  had  me  very  intrigued. Well  she  introduced  us  and  her  ex  kind  of  had  an  attitude. I  looked  at  Teddy  and  said , He  better  chill  the  fuck  out  before  he  gets  knocked  the  fuck  out. I  thought  he  was  a  joke. I  couldnt  understand  what  she  had  ever  seen  in  him. She  was  sexy, sweet, crazy, funny and she  had  a  pretty  smile  that  went  with  her  pretty  eyes. She  was  a  character  I  knew  that  she  was  a  down  chic  and I  could  definitely  kick  it  with  her  for  the  weekend.   
      She  went  and  took  a  shower  after  laying  her  kids  down. Teddy  and  I  kicked  it  in  the  kitchen  for  a bit  and  we  clowned  on  Will,  her  ex. Then  she  walked  out  of  bathroom  in  a  black  silk  night  gown. It  wasnt  really  revealing,  but  man. Teddy  caught  the  hint  and  left  us  alone  in  her  room. I  didnt  want  to  just  rush  in  because  she  may  have  been  all  talk,  so  we  started  talking.
       She  laid  down  on  the  bed,  and  I  propped  myself  up  and  we  started  conversating. We  talked  about  everything. I felt  so  at  ease  with  her. I  mean  I  didnt  feel  like  I  had  anything  to  hide  from  her  at  all. I  have never  felt  this  comfortable  with  a  person  that  I  just  met  ever. My  heart  was  shattered  and  broken  and  the  more  we  talked  and  the  more  I  opened  up. I  could  feel  my  heart  melt." />
