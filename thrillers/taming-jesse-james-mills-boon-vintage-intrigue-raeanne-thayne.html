      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Jesse James Harte had grown up as wild and untamed as his Old West namesake, but now he was the law in this stretch of the Wyoming high country. That meant trouble was his business–and if he&#39;d ever seen somebody in trouble, it was the town&#39;s new schoolteacher, Sarah McKenzie….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She was as beautiful as a mountain meadow in springtime. But the haunted look in her eyes said she was running from something–something that had maybe caught up with her. He ached to protect her, to take that look away–and make her his forever….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But what could a lady like her want with a lawman with an outlaw&#39;s heart…?&lt;/p&gt;
