  <title>The Discovery - Harry R. Albers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alone at his observatory atop Mauna Kea Volcano in Hawaii, Dusty McCrae makes the discovery of his life ... another universe. Altitude plays tricks on the brain, and many nights of observing lie ahead before he can confirm the observations that will make his name the equal of Galileo and Hubble. But word leaks and trouble begins. Hes bombarded with inquiries by media, the public and scientists, many of them ridiculing him. Harassed by a reporter from a supermarket tabloid, he replies: &quot;Sure there could be aliens ... and a god no one has ever imagined.&quot; A media-savvy televangelist jumps on the comments and McCrae becomes embroiled in religious controversy. Complications multiply when hes invited to participate in a television debate. Naively, he accepts, thinking it an opportunity to calmly and logically quell the uproar, but his life is threatened and his boat firebombed with him and a companion aboard. Desperate about whats happening to his life and career, he agonizes over a way out of his predicament. He knows when he presents his discovery during the debate that emotions, not logic, will run rampant, but there will be an opportunity to vindicate his discovery and expose his pursuers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
