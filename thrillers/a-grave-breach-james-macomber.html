But when Arthur Matsen, a trusted friend, mentor and colleague needs his help, Cann must make an impossible choice.Forced to find the blurred boundaries between blind trust and what is seen, Cann is haunted by thoughts of Janie Reston, a young college girl savagely brutalized and left for dead all because of her connection to him.As Cann is consumed with complex legal and ethical issues, Janie is in grave danger.
