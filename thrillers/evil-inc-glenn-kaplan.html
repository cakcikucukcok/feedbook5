  <title>Evil, Inc. - Glenn Kaplan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ken Olson thought he had it all--a loving wife, a beautiful baby, and a career on the fast track. But soon after his big promotion, his whole world is shattered by a monstrous crime. A crime committed by the CEO of his own company. A crime his company will cover up at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stripped of everything but his passion to bring the CEO to justice, Olson uncovers the dark and dangerous world behind the corporate jets and executive mansions--the private armies of mercenary killers who do the corporation&#39;s dirtiest work under the guise of &quot;plausible deniability,&quot; the offshore banking havens with their clandestine black-hole accounts, and the relentless greed of the lucky few at the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson&#39;s struggle pits him against a host of deadly rivals--the most brutal killer in the international private military underworld, the network anchorwoman with a beautiful face and not a hint of conscience, the aristocrat who pulls the strings of power and never dirties his hands, the hot young actress who makes sex a tool of deception, and, of course, his own chief executive, a bloodthirsty psychopath who has hijacked the corner office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set against the backdrop of today&#39;s business world, where mega-mergers slash thousands of jobs and yield million-dollar executive payouts, &lt;i&gt;Evil, Inc&lt;/i&gt;. is a thrilling, ticking time bomb of a story--a tale of one man&#39;s fight against the vicious, backstabbing politics of the corporation, where ruthless power mongers rule and human life counts for nothing against the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
