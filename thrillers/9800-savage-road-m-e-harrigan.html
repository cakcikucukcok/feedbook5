  <title>9800 Savage Road - M. E. Harrigan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;December, 2000:  In a tiny office in the basement of the National Security Agency, a handful of analysts work on a project so secret its existence is known to fewer than a hundred people. They are intercepting Osama bin Laden&#39;s every word as he talks on his satellite phone to al Qaeda cells.  What he&#39;s planning is big--a strike against the U.S.--and they know from the intercepts they&#39;ll learn the details any day... any minute.  Suddenly, the conversations stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Senior Executive is murdered inside the NSA complex, the first in a series of disasters inflicted from both inside and outside the carefully concealed house of spies.  Alexandra O&#39;Malley, consummate Intelligence Analyst, must sort through the clues and scramble to stop the escalating crises... but to succeed, she&#39;ll have to break all the rules.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;9800 Savage Road&lt;/i&gt;, reality and fiction intersect in a terrifying story of the events leading up to 9/11 from deep within the cloistered walls of NSA.  M. E. Harrigan delivers the first insider&#39;s perspective in NSA&#39;s history.  She shreds the thick veil of secrecy and explores the thoughts and actions, the dedication and bureaucratic infighting, and the occasional scandals of the hidden workforce.  It&#39;s a story of betrayal and treachery, courage and loyalty... so real you&#39;ll wonder how much is true. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
