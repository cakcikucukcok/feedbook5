      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Wow, Wow and Wow what a book&amp;#x2026; What a twist! What an ending!&lt;/b&gt;... Big 5 fat stars for this book&amp;#x2026; I loved it.&#39; 5 stars, Goodreads reviewer&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#39;Had me &lt;b&gt;hooked, intrigued and gripped&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#x2026; If you enjoyed &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; this is a book you will enjoy.&#39; &lt;i&gt;Gemma&#39;s Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;&lt;b&gt;Everything I had hoped it would be (and much, much more)!&lt;/b&gt;... I found myself reading way past my bedtime because I couldn&#39;t put it down&amp;#x2026; &lt;b&gt;A fantastic thriller that will knock your socks off&lt;/b&gt;.&#39; 5 stars, Steph and Chris Book Reviews &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He loves you. He&#39;d do anything for you. But you shouldn&#39;t trust him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jenny&lt;/b&gt; hasn&#39;t had an easy time of it - she&#39;s a devoted caretaker to her chronically ill mother - but at last things are beginning to look up. Through writing about her experience online she&#39;s discovered new friends - a whole community of people who understand what she&#39;s going through. And when a shy young man called &lt;b&gt;David&lt;/b&gt; gets in touch to ask her on a date - well, it feels like all her dreams have come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just as Jenny is beginning to picture her future in David&#39;s sprawling family home, something feels wrong. How can David be so perfect? Little comments and gifts make Jenny begin to wonder: does David know things about her past that she&#39;s never told &lt;i&gt;anybody&lt;/i&gt;? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An absolutely addictive psychological thriller about the lies we tell ourselves, perfect for fans of B A Paris, &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sweet Little Lies&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What everyone&#39;s saying about &lt;i&gt;Liars&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;&lt;b&gt;This was quite a ride!&lt;/b&gt; The suspense just kept building and building and I couldn&#39;t wait to find out what would happen next. Gripping!&#39; 5 stars, &lt;i&gt;The Princess and the Pen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#39;&lt;b&gt;Amazing&lt;/b&gt; book which kept me guessing the whole way through&#39; 5 stars, Goodreads reviewer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;&lt;b&gt;Secrets, lies, deception&lt;/b&gt;, manipulation, abuse, stalking, and obsession; all ingredients for this &lt;b&gt;deliciously unnerving&lt;/b&gt; psychological thriller&amp;#x2026; I highly recommend it.&#39; &lt;i&gt;Bookishly Ever After&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Had me &lt;b&gt;hooked, intrigued and gripped&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#x2026; This story is creepy, mysterious and &lt;b&gt;will mess with your head&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#x2026; If you enjoyed &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; this is a book you will enjoy.&#39; &lt;i&gt;Gemma&#39;s Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#39;&lt;b&gt;Brilliant!!
