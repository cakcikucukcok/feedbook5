  <title>All in My Head - Sonja Senhouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sacha has just enjoyed a lovely birthday celebration, courtesy of her devoted husband, Steven. After he falls asleep, she opens an envelope attached to a gift. Inside is an unsigned love poem. The box holds a King James Bible and a heart pendant. After Sacha realizes the gifts are from Steven, she knows that if he will give her another chance, she can love him again. But what he does not know is that Sacha has already committed the ultimate betrayal behind his back.
As she travels back in time through her memories, Sacha begins a poignant journey to understand love. While revisiting the moment she first met Vince Monroe and began a complex affair shortly after celebrating her tenth wedding anniversary, Sacha realizes that her world has always been a perilous place where love struggles to thrive. As she reconciles past issues related to abandonment, abuse, and disillusionment, Sacha learns how to separate truth from lies while searching for new ways to view herself, true love, and others. Now only time will tell if Sacha will finally recognize what matters most in life.
All in My Head shares the introspective tale of a womans struggle to overcome a moral dilemma and move forward into a future devoid of self-loathing." />
