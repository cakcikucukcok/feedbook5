  <title>Mayan Storm - Michael Hooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="December 21, 2012 is fast approaching.  Youve heard the date, you know what it means: The End of Days, the fall of mankind, the end of the world, Armageddon.   December 21st 2012, the Mayan Long Count Calendar ticks off its final day triggering the colossal battle between the forces of good and evil.
Meanwhile, just months removed from averting death and disaster while recovering a massive haul of gold and silver from a long lost Spanish treasure ship, part time undercover operative Bear Mayne and his appallingly inappropriate brother lead a team of wondrously beautiful women as they become embroiled in a doomsday prophesy a thousand years in the making.  While coming to the aid of a beautiful and mysterious coworker, Bear and his elite team of professionally amateur operatives learn the truth behind the myths and legends surrounding the Mayan civilization and their infamous long count calendar.
Journeying from St. Augustine to the Mexican Yucatan and back, Bear and his team battle snipers, Nazi zombies, wild animals, poison dart shooting warriors, primitive and blood thirsty mobs as well as a score Mayan priests who just cant wait to offer up gringo blood to the dark gods of the cosmos.  Along the way Bear inadvertently discovers clues to an unrelated Templar mystery and even has the occasion to participate in a sacred death match Mayan ballgame.  With the skill born of hundreds of incursions behind enemy lines, Bear Mayne somehow steers his team through this maze of bizarre and unexpected dangers only to come face to face with the celestial firestorm that marks the beginning of the final battle between good and evil." />
