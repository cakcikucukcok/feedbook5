  <title>Last Piece of the Puzzle - Jessie Carr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Going from one foster home to another, Sammy Backer hated her lonely life. Quitting school, getting a job and her own apartment, made life more bearable, but meeting Linda and Pam, made it worth living. The three girls became best friends. Every Saturday morning they&#39;ve got together for coffee, and kept that tradition going for many years.
&lt;p&gt;
   Being an orphan, Sammy dreamed of having a big family of her own. Marrying Ted Steel was going to make her dream a reality, she was sure of it. However, by marrying Ted, she inherited a father-in-law from hell. He was the nastiest man Sammy had ever encountered. Having money and power, John Steel was able to pull a perfect scam. When he got his mistress pregnant, and she refused to keep the baby, John switched his son&#39;s newborn daughter with his own. It took sixteen years, a divorce, and John&#39;s death before Sammy learned that all those years she was raising her husband&#39;s half-sister, and a total stranger was taking care of her real daughter. 
&lt;p&gt;
   The next chapter of Sammy&#39;s life unfolded following a string of events, which landed her in the hospital. With some damage to her vocal cords, she was left at a mercy of a stranger claiming to be her husband. Her efforts to convince the doctor, the nurse and the stranger that she wasn&#39;t the person they were claiming her to be, were quickly accredited to her memory loss due to the bump on her head. Sammy had no way of letting them know that her memory was fine. 
&lt;p&gt;
   When the stranger took her to his home and his real wife walked into the room, everything started to make sense, the last piece of the puzzle of Sammy&#39;s life, was put into place.
