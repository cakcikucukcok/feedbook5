  <title>Voodoo and Christianity - Joseph P. Policape</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tell our stories, my child. It was his mothers last wish. Now, three years after her
death, he gathers the stories that changed his life forever. Author Joseph P. Policape introduces us to the man responsible for recording these stories of faiths
victory in his new book entitled &lt;i&gt;Voodoo and Christianity: Confrontations between Good
and Evil.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
Marios flooded memories bring him back to the time of distant wounds. He had
witnessed the town of Bainet suffering during its most treacherous times. Once,
the whole town was slaved by the demonic voodoo spirit until a small band of
Protestants started a war against them. His own family had been torn apart by this
spiritual war; Marios mother had been a strong believer of Jesus while the father
had rejected Christianity, for his voodoo gods.&lt;bR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Read and discover the struggle that leads to the victory for the Pentecost faith
in &lt;i&gt;Voodoo and Christianity&lt;/i&gt;. After reading this book, readers will see how Jesus Christ
alone stopped the dominant curse of Satan and his bloody, hopeless helpers
in Bainet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Poetry was the river that Mr. Policape dived into to wash off the anger of his
soul. It helped him to mock his own madness and was his support when he finally
forgave himself and the world around him. His very first published book had the
peculiar title, The Birds Love for Poetry and Essays, and came out in 2004. Two years
later, in 2006, an intense, creative time, he published two books,&lt;i&gt; A Spiritual Journey &lt;/i&gt;
and &lt;i&gt; Interpretations of Romance &lt;/i&gt;, and now working on two more creations, which
hopefully will be out in the fall of 2009.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
Mr. Joseph P. Policape has received a gold medal from Famous Poet in 2007.
He is a distinguished member of the National Poetry.com and Cambridge
Whos Who. Mr. Policape received his undergraduate degree in economics at the
University of Massachusetts in Boston, and he completed his graduate degree in
management information systems at Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
However, during those times, he was reading, writing, singing, and loving
poetry. His daytime advocates were rightfully telling him that one poetry was
stealing too much of his time from economics and management, but he literally
and poetically ignored them!" />
