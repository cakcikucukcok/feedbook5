  <title>Blown Away (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (A Storm Front Novel, Book 1) - Sharon Sala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Writer Cari North thought she knew all about plot twists–until she stumbled across her ex-fiancé, Lance Morgan, digging a grave in the Louisiana woods. After a horrifying moment of shared recognition, Cari knew her life hinged upon whether she could outrun Lance and the tornado barreling down on them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just when she thinks she&#39;s lost Lance and heads home, the storm throws in another twist that will change her fate–forever.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cari&#39;s house, her family–her entire life–have been wiped out. Badly injured and knowing Lance will come after her, she trades clothing and ID with the near-identical cousin who&#39;d been visiting and flees to Baton Rouge. While the world mourns Cari North, she begins an agonizing recovery as Susan–until Susan&#39;s boss calls her bluff and finds himself drawn into her incredible tale.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hunted by a man she once loved, sheltered by a man she hardly knows, Cari chooses to become the bait…and plots the twist of a lifetime to catch a killer.&lt;/p&gt;
