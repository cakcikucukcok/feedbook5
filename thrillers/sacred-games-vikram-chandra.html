  <title>Sacred Games - Vikram Chandra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now a Netflix original series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;SACRED GAMES [is] as hard to put down as it is to pick up.&amp;#8221;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Book Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Bold, fresh and big&amp;#8230;SACRED GAMES deserves praise for its ambitions but also for its terrific achievement&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;Maureen Corrigan, NPR&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven years in the making, &lt;em&gt;Sacred Games&lt;/em&gt; is an epic of exceptional richness and power. Vikram Chandra&#39;s novel draws the reader deep into the life of Inspector Sartaj Singh&amp;#8212;and into the criminal underworld of Ganesh Gaitonde, the most wanted gangster in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sartaj, one of the very few Sikhs on the Mumbai police force, is used to being identified by his turban, beard and the sharp cut of his trousers. But &quot;the silky Sikh&quot; is now past forty, his marriage is over and his career prospects are on the slide. When Sartaj gets an anonymous tip-off as to the secret hide-out of the legendary boss of G-Company, he&#39;s determined that he&#39;ll be the one to collect the prize. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vikram Chandra&#39;s keenly anticipated new novel is a magnificent story of friendship and betrayal, of terrible violence, of an astonishing modern city and its dark side. Drawing inspiration from the classics of nineteenth-century fiction, mystery novels, Bollywood movies and Chandra&#39;s own life and research on the streets of Mumbai, &lt;em&gt;Sacred Games&lt;/em&gt; evokes with devastating realism the way we live now but resonates with the intelligence and emotional depth of the best of literature. &lt;/p&gt;" />
