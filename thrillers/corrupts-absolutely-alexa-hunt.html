  <title>Corrupts Absolutely - Alexa Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An action-packed thriller about the NEXT war on terror...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First came &quot;the Slaughter&quot;: the Colombian drug cartel launched a massive attack on American soil, assassinating thousands of federal judges and law enforcement officers in an attempt to stop the crackdown on drugs. Then came public outrage: Congress created a new supersecret agency, the Bureau of Illegal Substance Control. BISC operatives short-circuit due process, acting as judge, jury, and executioner for drug traffickers. When she loses her kid brother to a drug OD, Leah Berglund is recruited by BISC. She becomes one of their finest agents and a skillful assassin. She has a perfect kill record for every guilty verdict. Then she is assigned to a special case...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliott Delgado was a hot shot FBI agent until a burst of machine-gun fire retired him on a disability pension. Now all Del wants is to spend time with his son and enjoy his new career as a Pulitzer Prize--winning reporter. Until he receives a phone call from his old mentor at the FBI....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posing as a research assistant to Del, Leah investigates secret drug charges against him while he uncovers a conspiracy between BISC and the Pentagon. He learns that the war on drugs is about to go nuclear. The Western Hemisphere will be flash-fried if the conspirators are not stopped. As she digs deeper into Del&#39;s case, Leah realizes she has been set up to kill an innocent man. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now she and Del are running targets as BISC agents chase them from Mexico to Maine. America&#39;s worst nightmare is set to begin if they can&#39;t run fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
