  <title>Ship of the Damned - James F. David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On October 28, 1943, a U.S. Navy ship was successfully teleported with disastrous effects on its crew.  Crewmen died, developed rare or yet unidentified diseases, and most horrifying of all, some became fused to the metal, their arms and legs protruding from the bulkhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of psychologists has gathered at a small university to study and analyze the same reoccurring dream of seven completely different people.  The dream involves a large navy ship in a vast desert with soldiers trapped inside the bulkheads.  Slowly, by depriving the dreamers of REM sleep, the dreams are killing the dreamers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the dreamers do not realize is that another vessel; this one equipped with nuclear missiles has disappeared in a green-gray mist over the North Atlantic.  Only Elizabeth Foxworth, a social worker studying the dreamers, can prevent nuclear disaster by entering the dream, and risking her life and the lives of the dreamers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
