  <title>Cold to the Touch - Frances Fyfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A tense psychological thriller ideal for fans of Faye Kellerman and Louise Penny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things are not going well for prestigious lawyer and professional mistress Sarah Fortune. Her life is a mess, but it would be so much simpler to try and fix somebody else&#39;s. So when she meets the vulnerable and troubled Jessica Hurley, Sarah feels she must save her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica longs to return to the small village where she grew up, but she has burned all her bridges. Instead, Sarah travels to Jessica&#39;s cloistered hometown to repair the wreckage of her friend&#39;s past&amp;#8212;and to solve the mystery of why she left in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Sarah arrives, she finds that Jessica is even more unwelcome than she thought, and suddenly Jessica is missing, her number unavailable. Sarah&#39;s increasingly desperate search for her tortured friend takes her to places even colder than the grave.&lt;/p&gt;" />
