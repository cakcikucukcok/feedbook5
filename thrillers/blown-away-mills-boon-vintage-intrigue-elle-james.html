  <title>Blown Away (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Elle James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Overseas, TJ Barton narrowly survived an American Embassy bombing, only to lose two good men: her influential boss and her lover, Sean McNeal.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Back in Washington, TJ set out to find out who did it. Undaunted, she maneuvered through corridors of power, exposing the secrets hidden behind every door on Capitol Hill– only to smack right into the broad, familiar chest of Sean McNeal– in the flesh. And she could have, would have decked him if she had the opportunity to get a good shot!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Inexplicably Sean had survived and was now undercover. He needed TJ&#39;s silence, her help and her kisses more than he wanted to admit. The last thing he wanted to do was draw TJ into a web of high-stakes corruption. But there was no shaking her off and there was no way she was going to let him get killed– again.&lt;/p&gt;
