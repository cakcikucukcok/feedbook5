  <title>Adios! - Dennis J. Wootten, Stephen A. Enna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ADIOS is the second book in this action packed political thriller trilogy.  The first in the series was ALOHA.  If you liked ALOHA, then youre going to love ADIOS.
President Bruce Gavin has his hands full with problems on all fronts.  At the top of his list are illegal immigration and the influx of drugs from the Mexican Drug Cartels.  Now he learns that al-Qaeda has been in meetings with the largest cartel in Mexico. Nothing good can come from this.
Can a determined woman with two small children stop the most powerful Cartel in Mexico?  Follow her intense journey as the drug cartel desperately seeks to destroy her and her family.  Will her actions impact US policy on immigration?  
President Gavin is out of the closet and in a relationship with a defrocked Catholic Priest.  Will the US and the World accept an openly gay President or will his sexuality be the cause of his ultimate demise?
ADIOS sets you up for the finale in the last book of the trilogy, GOODBYE." />
