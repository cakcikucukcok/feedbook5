  <title>Hanging Hill - Mo Hayder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;#147;[Hayder] has in no way lost her ability to shock, thrill, entertain and occasionally torture us with her use of words. . . . A chiller to the very end. Hayder deals with Britain at its grittiest.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;Peter Millar, &lt;I&gt;The Times&lt;/I&gt; (London)&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mo Hayder is a world-class author of gritty, gripping page-turners, winner of the Dagger in the Library from the Crime Writers&amp;#8217; Association for outstanding body of work. With her latest novel, she ratchets up the terror to fever pitch. Fast-paced and addictive, &lt;I&gt;Hanging Hill&lt;/I&gt; centers around a pair of estranged sisters&amp;#151;one a cop, one a coddled wife fallen on hard times&amp;#151;and the gruesome homicide of a teenage beauty, which exposes the nightmares that lurk at the edges of our safe domestic lives.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One morning in picture-perfect Bath, England, a teenage girl&amp;#8217;s body is found on the towpath of a canal. Lorne Wood&amp;#151;beautiful, popular, and apparently the victim of a disturbingly brutal murder. Why was she on the towpath alone late at night? Zoe Benedict&amp;#151;Harley-riding police detective, independent to a fault&amp;#151;is convinced the department head needs to look beyond the usual domestic motives to solve the case, but no one wants to hear it, especially from the department&amp;#8217;s black sheep. Meanwhile, Zoe&amp;#8217;s sister, Sally&amp;#151;recently divorced and in dire financial straits, supporting a daughter who was friends with the dead girl&amp;#151;has begun working as a housekeeper for a rich entrepreneur who seems less eccentric and more repugnant, and possibly dangerous. And why are his sinister associates showing up at her daughter&amp;#8217;s school? When Zoe&amp;#8217;s investigation turns up evidence that Lorne&amp;#8217;s attempts to break into modeling had delivered her into the world of webcam girls and amateur porn, a crippling secret from Zoe&amp;#8217;s past seems determined to emerge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All roads seem to be leading to one conclusion: there&amp;#8217;s something very wrong at the house on Hanging Hill. But will Zoe and Sally put their differences aside and fit all the pieces together before it&amp;#8217;s too late? &lt;I&gt;Hanging Hill&lt;/I&gt; is a masterful, terrifying book that will have readers sleeping with the lights on.&lt;/div&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Hanging Hill - Mo Hayder</i></b> | Hanging Hill is the story of two sisters, opposites in everything and estranged until dark events bring them back together once again. This is a classic Hayder novel, where I read this lightheaded from holding my breath in anticipation for the next fright I am sure to receive. And this never lets up throughout the whole novel!<br /><b><i>Hanging Hill by Mo Hayder - Goodreads</i></b> | Hanging Hill is a murder mystery, but it is also about lies, relationships, connections, and the secrets we cannot bear to have brought to light. If you enjoy British writers such as Sophie Hannah, and like your mysteries dark and twisty, you should read Hanging Hill. I only wish Mo Hayder wrote more often.<br /><b><i>Hanging Hill: Hayder, Mo: 9780802120854: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | "Hanging Hill is an authentically disturbing, gripping winner." - Christopher Fowler, Financial Times "[Hayder] has in no way lost her ability to shock, thrill, entertain, and occasionally torture us with her use of words...A chiller to the very end.
