  <title>A Hustler&#39;s Tale - C.J. Land</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Hustlers Tale
  Welcome to the world of shadows where everthing is not what it seems.
  A world where conmen, pimps, drug dealers and thieves struggle daily to survive and prosper. 
  The rules are different in the world of shadows and the games played are for keeps. 
  In the drug-ridden streets  
of Cleveland, Darius Javon a charismatic conman at the top of his game pursues his dream of becoming a multi-millionaire. The cons and scams which he runs on the Banks take intricate planning and nerves of steel to pull off. 
  But robbing banks is the least of his problems. 
  FBI agents are in hot pursuit of a certain elusive conman who is making a mockery of the banking system in the country. He is consider a threat to the Economy of the United States, because he robs with an ink pen and a smile leaving the female tellers wishing he would come again. 
  While barely staying one step ahead of the FEDs he inadvertantly kidnap a woman bringing the wrath of a very dangerous man down on him. With the FEDs and the criminal underworld closing in on him, Darius must make some real hard decisions that may cost him his life or his freedom. The deadly game he is playing is about to come to an abrupt end. There can be only one winner and Darius is determined to make sure its him. He will live by the game or die by the game but the game must be played." />
