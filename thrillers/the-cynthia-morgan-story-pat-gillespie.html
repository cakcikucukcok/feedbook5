Back then, the marriage was arranged by the girls parents. Unbeknownst to anyone, the witch fell in love with the same man and before the two were to wed the witch cursed Clarisa. Thus ending her life when she gave birth to her first-born child, a girl. For several generations after, the curse carried on, until it reached Catherine Habersham-Fairbanks, where both she and her daughter die.&lt;/p&gt; 
	After their deaths, Catherines husband, Morgan Fairbanks, an OB-GYN, learns that she was the last known heiress to the Morgan Estate in New Orleans, which he now inherits. Once he takes charge of the estate, things get really intense. He meets the spirit of his late wifes great-great grandmother, Cynthia Morgan, who is the spitting image of his beloved Catherine. At the same time, a very powerful man decides he wants the Morgan Estate for himself, and is willing to kill for it.&lt;/p&gt; 
	Its now Cynthia and Morgans story with yet one more crucial hitch, Michael Fairington, Cynthias true love, who had been done in by Cynthias father, when he discovered her pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
