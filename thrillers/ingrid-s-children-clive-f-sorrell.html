      <meta name="description" content="James Goodfellow was fired from the police force for repeatedly sleeping on the job but his passion to be a detective was stronger than his narcolepsy so he went into business with his own private investigation agency. His first client required her burgled gems to be recovered which led to the discovery of a strangled woman at East Steading station. James is consequently drawn into a lethal web of deceit and murder that can threaten Europe with the return of an old order and genocide. James takes on the task of exterminating this cancer before it becomes too powerful to stop." />
