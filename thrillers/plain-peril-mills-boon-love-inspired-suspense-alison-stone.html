        &lt;p&gt;After her sister is found dead and her brother-in-law goes missing, Hannah Wittmer rushes back to the Amish community she abandoned to care for her young nieces. Although she makes every effort to blend in, she&#39;s still seen as an outsider–and quickly attracts the attention of a killer. She knows Sheriff Spencer Maxwell is fast on the murderer&#39;s tracks, but the Amish townspeople are as suspicious of him as they are of Hannah. As threats escalate–now targeting Hannah and the handsome sheriff–they&#39;ll follow any trail to uncover a vicious criminal. Even if that trail leads them right to their own backyard…&lt;/p&gt;
