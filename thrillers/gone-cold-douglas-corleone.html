  <title>Gone Cold - Douglas Corleone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twelve years after a kidnapping destroyed former US Marshal Simon Fisk&#39;s family, he is newly determined to find the people responsible for taking his then-six-year-old daughter. Returning home from a case, Simon transforms his apartment into a war room and refuses to step away from the cold case, even after enduring months of dead ends and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, at last, he gets a break in the case. On a brutal January night, Simon finds an urgent message on his computer. Attached are two images: one, a computer-generated image of Hailey Fisk had she reached eighteen years of age; the second, a sketch of a young woman wanted for murder in Ireland. The two images aren&#39;t identical, but there are striking similarities. Within a matter of hours, Simon is on a flight to Dublin, setting off to find a girl who may be Hailey Fisk--before she&#39;s arrested for murder.&lt;/p&gt;" />
