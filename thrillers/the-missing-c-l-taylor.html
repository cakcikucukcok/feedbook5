      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this harrowing psychological thriller about a missing teenage boy whose mother must expose the secrets within their own family if she wants to find her son&amp;#8212;perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;Reconstructing Amelia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You love your family. They make you feel safe. You trust them. Or do you&amp;#8230;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When fifteen-year-old Billy Wilkinson goes missing in the middle of the night, his mother, Claire Wilkinson, blames herself. She&amp;#8217;s not the only one. There isn&amp;#8217;t a single member of Billy&amp;#8217;s family that doesn&amp;#8217;t feel guilty. But the Wilkinsons are so used to keeping secrets from one another that it isn&amp;#8217;t until six months later, after an appeal for information goes horribly wrong, that the truth begins to surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claire is sure of two things&amp;#8212;that Billy is still alive and that her friends and family had nothing to do with his disappearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mother&amp;#8217;s instinct is never wrong. Or is it&amp;#8230;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining an unreliable narrator and fast-paced storytelling, &lt;em&gt;The Missing&lt;/em&gt; is a chilling novel of psychological suspense that will thoroughly captivate and obsess readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;The Missing&lt;/em&gt; has a delicious sense of foreboding from the first page, luring us into the heart of a family with terrible secrets and making us wait, with pounding hearts for the final, agonizing twist.
