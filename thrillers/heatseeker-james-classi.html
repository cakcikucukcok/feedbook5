      <meta name="description" content="On a 20X20 boxing ring in the belly of Madison Square Garden, Tommy Farrow defends his title for the WBO championship belt against Jeffrey Johnson. Near the end of the 10th round, a solid left hook to Farrow&#39;s head drops him to the canvas, killing him instantly.
Thus begins an adventure into hell and a race against the clock.
     Farrow must rescue the soul of a writer who dies just seconds before him. The writer, Robert Scalia, has been hijacked by demons through a passage into purgatory called the Hellmouth.
     Tommy Farrow has been told that in the future Scalia is going to write a tell-all book that will prevent a madman from becoming the President of the United States...a madman who will eventually cause a nuclear war, ending the world as we know it.
     The final round is upon us.The timer is set. Get ready to rock" />
