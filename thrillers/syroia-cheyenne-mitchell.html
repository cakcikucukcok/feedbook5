&quot;WHAT IF  THE  DEMONIC  SPIRIT  OF A LONG-DEAD MURDERER  WAS AFTER YOUR SOUL  TO CONTINUE  ITS&#39;  KILLING  SPREE  WHICH  BEGAN  OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE YOU WERE EVEN BORN?&quot;   On his thirty fifth birthday Arquito Desmunde is given an old diary by his mother which belonged to his uncle, Ross Yarbrey.   Unknown to Quito, as his family calls him,  Uncle Ross was the unfortunate victim of a terror too horrible to be believed.  But only few family members know of this terror.   Once he begins to read the diary, Quito recalls the nightmare that he suffered at the hands of who he believed at the time was the spirit of  his Uncle Ross, but in reality his uncle himself was a victim of the same monstrous demon that he was.   An unholy terror that was a part of his family, and a well-kept secret by all.  However, it is not the only secret held by the Desmunde family, but only one of many.  To his astonishment Quito learns that he is only one in a long line of family members that this murderous monstrous demon has tormented through the years.  And in order to stop her forever he, along with his loving sister, seek the help of a powerful yet famous witch who reveals to them some of the many horrifying secrets that they have never known about.  To destroy this monster from their family forever Quito and his family will suffer a terrible tragedy." />
