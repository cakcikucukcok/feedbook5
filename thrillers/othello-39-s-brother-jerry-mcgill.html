  <title>Othello&#39;s Brother - Jerry Mcgill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the dark gray winter of the Pacific Northwest, a disturbing pattern is taking hold. In Portland, Oregon, two white males, in completely different locations, with no apparent connection, have been found brutally murdered in the same fashion: their skulls bashed in with a rock-pick hammer and their throats slashed with a straight razor. Beside each victim was placed the name of a slain civil-rights figure. When a third white male victim is found murdered in a suburb in Seattle a task force is put together to investigate what is clearly a serial killer case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading that task force is PATTON JAMESON of Portland Homicide. A white male in his late 40s, Jameson became famous early in his career for being part of a team that captured the notorious Polk Place Killer. But one old case that was tragically mishandled still haunts him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teamed with Jameson on that task force is MAYA DEVERAUX, an extremely talented 
young homicide detective with a chip on her shoulder that everyone assumes is because she is a black female in an all white profession. But it isnt as simple as that. Deveraux holds a dark secret close to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VERNON LANDRY is the head janitor at Portlands toughest high school. He possesses an anger towards a system that he feels has given so much advantage to white males at the expense of people of color, and one evening he just snaps. His first victim he killed out of sheer passion. But he had no idea he would enjoy killing so much, and before he knows it he cant stop. Under the moniker Othellos Brother he methodically terrorizes the city and begins a game of cat and mouse with the police force that ultimately addresses issues of culture, race, and asks the question: Just what is justice anyway?&lt;/p&gt;" />
