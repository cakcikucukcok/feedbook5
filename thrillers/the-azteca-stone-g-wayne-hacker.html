  <title>The Azteca Stone - G Wayne Hacker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Azteca Stone 
A Novel by G. Wayne Hacker
Texas businessman Eduardo Gomez was exploring a cave in Northern Mexico where he inadvertently set free the seven-hundred-year-old spirit of Moctezuma IIIwho would have been the next ruler of the enslaved ancient Aztecs if he had not been secretly abducted and buried by a Spanish priest and his followers. Once Moctezumas life force is released from the underground crypt, he displaces the soul of Eduardo. And with the help of the dark angel Abaddon, he uses the millionaires wealth and human form to reestablish one of the bloodiest and most powerful nations the world has ever known. He was well on the road to success when he had a chance encounter with Alejandra Santiago, a young attorney of Columbian heritage, and her US Marine Corpstrained boyfriend, police detective Free Varner. The couple, along with the help from the detectives rookie partner, Louisianan Francine Gilbeau, rises up to the challenge. But will their actions be enough to thwart the advancing forces of evil? And if so, at what cost?
The Azteca Stone is an original work that has no equal in todays contemporary marketplace. It is an action-packed thriller filled with bizarre rituals, human sacrifices, and an all-out assault on humanity by an army of genetically engineered half-human and half-beast gargoyles. The Azteca Stone will keep the readers gasping for air while at the same time crying out for more." />
