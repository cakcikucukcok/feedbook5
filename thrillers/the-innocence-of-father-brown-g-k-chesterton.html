  <title>The Innocence of Father Brown - G.k.chesterton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his day, Flambeau was a legend of the underworld. Even now, his old confederates remember with pride the Tyrolean Dairy scheme, in which he built a thriving milk business despite owning not a single cow. But today the master thief finally meets his match. Attempting to steal a priceless cross, Flambeau runs afoul of Father Brown, an ordinary-looking priest with amazing insight into the criminal mind. With grace, logic, and good humor, the stout little clergyman soon reforms one of England&amp;#39;s most notorious villains.&lt;br /&gt;
In thrilling tales such as &amp;quot;The Blue Cross,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Secret Garden,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Hammer of God,&amp;quot; G. K. Chesterton&amp;#39;s immortal priest-detective applies his extraordinary intuition to the most intricate of mysteries. No corner of the human soul is too dark for Father Brown, no villain too ingenious. The Innocence of Father Brown is a testament to the power of faith and the pleasure of a story well told." />
