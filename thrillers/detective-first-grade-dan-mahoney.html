  <title>Detective First Grade - Dan Mahoney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a secret war on the streets of the city. Only a New York cop can win it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His claim to fame is finding guns on the bad guys, and Detective Second Grade Brian McKenna has just spotted the beard carrying a piece. What he doesn&#39;t know is that he&#39;s about to shoot his way into a war with a highly disciplined, well-armed enemy so treacherous, not even the NYPD knows they exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exiled from the bright lights of Manhattan for breaking one too many rules, pressured by his girlfriend to quit the job, this is McKenna&#39;s last chance to win back his reputation and make the coveted rank of Detective First Grade. But if his moves aren&#39;t swift and right, a new breed of criminal-- who has found a leader in an exotically beautiful and ruthless woman-- will own his city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the savvy and experience of a cop who gave over 25 years of his life to the NYPD comes a stunning novel of undeniable authenticity and unrelenting suspense.&lt;/p&gt;" />
