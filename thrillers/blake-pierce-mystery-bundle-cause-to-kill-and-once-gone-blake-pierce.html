  <title>Blake Pierce: Mystery Bundle (Cause to Kill and Once Gone) - Blake Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A two-book mystery bundle by #1 bestselling author Blake Pierce, author of ONCE GONE, a #1 bestseller on Amazon with over 350 five star reviews!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a bundle of the first books in two Blake Pierce series—the Avery Black, and Riley Paige series—all here in one convenient place. This bundle offers a great introduction to Blake Pierce’s series with over 140,000 words of reading.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CAUSE TO KILL (AN AVERY BLACK MYSTERY—BOOK 1), Homicide Detective Avery Black has been through hell. Once a top criminal defense attorney, she fell from grace when she managed to get a brilliant Harvard professor off—only to watch him kill again. She lost her husband and her daughter, and her life fell apart around her. Trying to redeem herself, Avery has turned to the other side of the law. Working her way up the ranks, she has reached Homicide Detective, to the scorn of her fellow officers, who still remember what she did, and who will always hate her.Yet even they cannot deny Avery’s brilliant mind, and when a disturbing serial killer strikes fear into the heart of Boston, killing girls from elite colleges, it is Avery that they turn to. It is Avery’s chance to prove herself, to finally find the redemption she craves. And yet, as she is soon to find out, Avery has come up against a killer as brilliant and daring as she.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ONCE GONE (A RILEY PAIGE MYSTERY--BOOK #1), women are turning up dead in the rural outskirts of Virginia, killed in grotesque ways, and when the FBI is called in, they are stumped. A serial killer is out there, his frequency increasing, and they know there is only one agent good enough to crack this case: Special Agent Riley Paige. Riley is on paid leave herself, recovering from her encounter with her last serial killer, and, fragile as she is, the FBI is reluctant to tap her brilliant mind. Yet Riley, needing to battle her own demons, comes on board, and her hunt leads her through the disturbing subculture of doll collectors, into the homes of broken families, and into the darkest canals of the killer’s mind. As Riley peels back the layers, she realizes she is up against a killer more twisted than she could have imagined. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark psychological thrillers with heart-pounding suspense, CAUSE TO KILL and ONCE GONE mark the debut of riveting new series—and beloved new characters—that will leave you turning pages late into the night. Books #2 and #3 in the Riley Paige series are also available!" />
