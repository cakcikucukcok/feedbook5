  <title>Dracula Terrorizes Seattle - Richard Shallow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Down through the ages, people have been fascinated by horror stories! There had always been mystical stories of the spilling of blood, like blood sacrifices to the gods for a good harvest or the consumption of blood from a warrior to gain the dead warriors strength.  Look no further than our own Bible. Look at Cain and Abel, the Aztec, Toltec, Inca, and many of the Central and South American tribes.
A person walking past a narrow alley in the daytime will give it a quick glance and think nothing of it. But add the darkness of a late night or a sudden wind or a sudden noise or a shadow upon the wall and have that same person walk past that same alley, and he will conjure up within his mind all kinds of things hiding in that alley.
Many people are fascinated by eternal life and staying young forever. As an example, look at the money we spend on makeup to camouflage our age. A vampire can accomplish staying young forever by drinking the blood of the living. It is the ancient ritual of consuming the blood of the living to extend ones life or to absorb virility, strength, and youth of the one that was killed.
There are stories that have been handed down through the ages about the existence of vampires in the Far East, like China and Japan, all over Europe, but mostly in Eastern Europe, particularly in Romania and Bulgaria." />
