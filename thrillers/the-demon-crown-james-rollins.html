  <title>The Demon Crown - James Rollins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Bone-chilling.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211;&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; (Starred Review)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;One of the best in the series.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211;&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt; (Starred Review)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To save mankind&amp;#8217;s future, the members of Sigma Force must make a devil&amp;#8217;s bargain as they join forces with their most hated enemy to stop an ancient threat in this gripping adventure from #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author James Rollins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off the coast of Brazil, a team of scientists discovers a horror like no other, an island where all life has been eradicated, consumed, and possessed by a species beyond imagination. Before they can report their discovery, a mysterious agency attacks the group, killing them all, save one: an entomologist, an expert on venomous creatures, Professor Ken Matsui from Cornell University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strangest of all, this inexplicable threat traces back to a terrifying secret buried a century ago beneath the National Mall: a cache of bones preserved in amber. The artifact was hidden away by a cabal of scientists&amp;#8212;led by Alexander Graham Bell&amp;#8212;to protect humankind. But they dared not destroy it, for the object also holds an astonishing promise for the future: &lt;em&gt;the very secret of life after death&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet nothing stays buried forever. An ancient horror&amp;#8212; dormant in the marrow of those preserved bones&amp;#8212;is free once more, nursed and developed into a weapon of incalculable strength and malignancy, ready to wreak havoc on an unsuspecting world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stop its spread, Commander Grayson Pierce of Sigma Force must survive a direct attack on the island of Maui. To be there first has always been the core mission of Sigma Force, a covert team forged to be America&amp;#8217;s front line against emerging threats. But this time, even Sigma may not be able to decipher the deadly mystery, one that traces back to the founding of the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With each new discovery, the menace they hunt is changing, growing, spreading&amp;#8212;adapting and surviving every attempt to stop it from reconquering a world it once ruled. And each transformation makes it stronger . . . and smarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running out of time and options, Commander Grayson Pierce will be forced to make an impossible choice. To eradicate this extinction-level threat and expose those involved, he will have to join forces with Sigma&amp;#8217;s greatest enemy&amp;#8212;the newly resurrected Guild&amp;#8212;even if it means sacrificing one of his own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
