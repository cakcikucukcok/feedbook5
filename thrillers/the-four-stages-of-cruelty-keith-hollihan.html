  <title>The Four Stages of Cruelty - Keith Hollihan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ditmarsh Penitentiary holds many secrets within its walls. A maximum-security prison, it contains every breed of hatred, self-destruction, greed, and regret. Its inmates aren&#39;t the only ones who grapple with these emotions. Under constant threat yet given absolute authority, the guards routinely cross the divide between law enforcement and criminality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrections Officer Kali Williams takes pains to avoid the complicated traps of inmates and guards alike. Then a young inmate named Joshua comes to her for help. He claims that another prisoner has drawn an elaborate comic book, which holds a guide to the illicit underworld of Ditmarsh. The struggle to obtain the information encoded in its pages has been the cause of ever-increasing violence throughout the prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first Kali can&#39;t take Joshua seriously. But soon afterward, the artist-inmate disappears completely. As she retraces his steps, she enters a labyrinthine world inside the prison with unexpected connections to the outside world. Along the way, she uncovers the most bewildering secret of all ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Hollihan&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Four Stages of Cruelty &lt;/i&gt;is a story of the mystery of human compassion, the twisted forms it can take, and the violence and redemption it makes possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
