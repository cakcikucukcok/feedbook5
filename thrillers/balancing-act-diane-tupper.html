  <title>Balancing Act - Diane Tupper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kate, a forty-three-year-old single mother of three, is trying not to panic. As she hobbles down the street to the courthouse in her new high heels, she quickly realizes that law school has done nothing to prepare her for the real world of practicing law. Ready to embark on a year of articling as part of her last steps toward attorney accreditation, Kate finds herself in the midst of a balancing act she fears she will never get right.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she immerses herself in her new corporate life at a family law firm, she must somehow find her way in an intimidating environment made worse by a lack of an office, secretary, or her own chair. While dealing with the whirlwind that surrounds her lonely and rejected clients enduring divorce, custody battles, and the division of property, Kate is kept incredibly busy by the demands of her job and the pressure of caring for her children. To top it off, now she has been put in charge of the law firms softball team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Balancing Act&lt;/i&gt; shares a humorous, heartfelt glimpse into a single mothers struggle to balance the needs of her family with the demands of her career. Only time will tell if she will make it to the finish line without losing her balance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
