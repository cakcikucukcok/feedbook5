  <title>Thunder Horse Heritage (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Elle James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;d been his wife for barely a day and now FBI agent Tuck Thunder Horse was responsible for identifying her body.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So he was more than shocked when Julia Anderson turned up very much alive–and on the run. Julia confessed to witnessing a murder and now needs Tuck to help her stay alive…and protect the baby he hadn&#39;t known she&#39;d had.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Julia and Tuck&#39;s marriage might not have lasted, but there was no time for recriminations with a killer on their trail. As Tuck struggles to put their painful past behind them, he can&#39;t help but find himself overwhelmed by his love for his little daughter…and his still-burning passion for Julia. Unable to trust anyone but each other, they know working together is the only way to safeguard their child. Could their one-day marriage turn into a lifelong adventure?&lt;/p&gt;
