  <title>Sons of Darkness - Lecy McKenzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you ready for a scare?  Sons of Darkness Release of the Demons just might be the book to take you there. A science fiction thriller that will make you fear the darkness and pray for the light. A solar max is bringing with it much more than power being out all over the world but a threat to all of mankind. A reluctant Duncan Roberson follows his friends, but soon finds himself alone and outnumbered, darkness and death surrounding him, and having to battle vile twisted demons, some of whom had once been his friend.  Duncan soon realizes his presence there was not unexpected; it was deception that led him there.  He could have a bond with the demon that may make loosing this battle cost him more than his life, but his very soul.  Sometimes it is not always the strong that survive, and Duncan must look deep within himself to find the one thing that might give him the edge.  There is light at the end of the tunnel, but reaching it may be an unattainable goal." />
