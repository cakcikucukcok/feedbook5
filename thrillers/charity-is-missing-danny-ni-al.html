  <title>Charity Is Missing - Danny Ni単al</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charity Is Missing is a story of Charity as a person juxtaposed with Charity as a virtue, both of which were missing in the fictional Manakitanga Island when a series of crimes happened, all within the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Dunn, a police detective, and his very versatile team were tested for the first time. The city of Manakitanga was known as one of the most peaceful cities in the country. They never had a murder case in twenty-one years and never experienced a series of crimes committed all within forty-eight to seventy-two hours. But, as they followed every lead, they found themselves into a more sinister crime that was way beyond their cup of tea. But they cannot let the cup pass and the will of the evil one be done. The stakes were higher than they thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of the whole community, information was gathered, and the blurry picture of events became clearer but not necessarily better. The island gathered all its resources to fight the crime and to keep the city beautiful again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But life in the island was never the same again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
