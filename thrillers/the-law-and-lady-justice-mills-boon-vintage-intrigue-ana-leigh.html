        &lt;p&gt;SHE WAS HIGH SOCIETY. HE WAS BLUE COLLAR.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Judge Jessica Kirkland and Detective Doug McGuire clashed every chance they got, from the courtroom to the evening news, but ultimately they were after the same things–justice and each other. But they had every reason to ignore the passion singeing the air between them, tempting them to cross the line and risk it all….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Until someone started taking the law into his own hands, meting out punishment in the form of murder. Now the lady judge and the rugged detective had two new assignments: Stop the vigilante killer before it was too late…and keep from imprisoning each other&#39;s hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
