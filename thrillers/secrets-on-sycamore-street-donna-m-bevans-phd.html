  <title>Secrets on Sycamore Street - Donna M. Bevans, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Secrets on Sycamore Street is a suspense story about four housewives caught up in sex, lies, drugs, and blackmail.
Abandoned on a ranch in Wyoming by her drug-dealing parents, Catherine has no memory of her childhood before being adopted at age twelve by her grandmother. Educated in an all-girls Catholic school, she was not prepared for the changes in her life when she moved from Fort Collins, Colorado, a college town, to Irvine, California, an affluent bedroom community south of Los Angeles.
Entering marriage as a naive young woman, she feels unfulfilled in her role as a wife of a controlling, self-centered husband and mother of a two-year-old. With no money to finish her college education, she stumbles into a job as a sex phone operator. Fearing his disapproval, she keeps the nature of her job a secret from her husband. Surprisingly, she discovers she has a knack for dealing with the men who call, a skill she learns to use wisely.
Confiding in her friends about her job, she discovers they too have secrets. All too quickly, Catherine realizes secrets dont always stay hidden when a blackmail letter arrives, demanding money to keep silent." />
