  <title>Firefly - Henry Porter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;Henry Porter is frequently described as the heir to John le Carré and is a massive bestseller in the UK. After a nearly decade-long hiatus from fiction-writing, Firefly is a triumphant return from a writer at the top of his game. 
&lt;li&gt;A bestselling author in the UK, Porter won the CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award for &lt;i&gt;Brandenburg Gate&lt;/i&gt;, which was also named an &lt;i&gt;Economist&lt;/i&gt; best book of the year, and was again a finalist for the Steel Dagger for &lt;i&gt;The Bell Ringers&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Empire State&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;Grove Atlantic has previous published Porter’s &lt;i&gt;The Bell Ringers&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Brandenburg Gate&lt;/i&gt; on the Atlantic Monthly crime list and looks forward to welcoming Porter to The Mysterious Press. 
&lt;li&gt;Porter’s novels have a political timeliness and sophistication that speak to his long career as a political columnist/writer, previously for the &lt;i&gt;Observer&lt;/i&gt; and now for the &lt;i&gt;Hive&lt;/i&gt;, but they still manage to be high stakes and suspenseful in their plotting.     
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Firefly&lt;/i&gt; engages with the fight against the Islamic State, the Syrian Civil War, and, in particular, the refugee crisis in Europe. It captures the experience of an adolescent Syrian boy who washes ashore on Lesbos and makes his way towards Germany, where he hopes to be able to bring his family to safety, in a way that no journalistic report can, giving this book a uniquely humanizing and moving angle." />
