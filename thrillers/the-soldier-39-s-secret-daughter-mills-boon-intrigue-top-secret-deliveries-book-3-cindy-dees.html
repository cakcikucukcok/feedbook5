          &lt;strong&gt;“I hated you, but I still wanted you.” &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dashing spy Jagger lived in a world of danger. Not even a sweet brown-eyed siren could be trusted, especially when he had to bring down her employer. Somehow Emily broke through his defences – and set him up for two years of captivity. Or so he thought. Emily hadn’t expected a cryptic message to lead her to rescue the man who’d disappeared after their night of passion.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nor had she known that he’d been held prisoner and believed she was responsible. Despite the suspicion, they must work together to stop the threat against them…and protect their precious daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
