  <title>Spider&#39;s Web - Kurt Hafner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Intrigue, Greed and Murder culminate in a dramatic Conclusion to this International Web of Mystery and Deceit
Rolf and Sabine Brenners company and its USA subsidiary are flourishing as the Millennium approaches but their holiday on the Gulf Coast of Florida is marred by a terrible accident. - At the same time an ambitious and ruthless social climber is developing his predatory plans in England in order to acquire wealth and power in a vicious game of removing anything that may stand in his way.
A mysterious suspect is being tracked on his way to Miami by a young woman who is already an expert in fighting organised crime but unaware of the danger that she will meet after her arrival in the United States. A highly respected Aristocrat and powerful business investor travels by Concorde to New York in order to protect Brenner Inc. from collapse where he teams up with his celebrated and glamorous lawyer to face the subversive elements at large.
A brilliant police graduate with roots in the Bronx mounts a major campaign to identify, hunt down and eliminate the gang that has invaded Manhattan and caused major problems in Chicago. - A Harvard Professor and his family become embroiled in the fall out of intrigue and duplicity until their daughter Fiona decides to fight back and to confront the dark forces involved.
The action moves from an idyllic island off the West Coast of Florida to the English countryside until an attack takes place in Switzerland. New York, Miami and Chicago provide the background to an increasing number of sinister incidents until their dramatic conclusion is reached and the different pieces of the puzzle finally fall into place - But is the Spiders Web complete?" />
