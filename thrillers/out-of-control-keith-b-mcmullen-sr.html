  <title>Out of control - Keith  B. McMullen Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While in his youth, David&amp;rsquo;s ignorance of his environment and desire for friendship leave him vulnerable to the influences of the illicit members of his community. And though David is naive, as were his intentions, he is not excused from the consequences of his choices. David pays for his mistakes in time lost, personal attachment, and self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As David&amp;rsquo;s life moves forward, he&amp;rsquo;s embraced by people who see in him value he can&amp;rsquo;t see himself. Eventually, David is faced with the reality that one person who has been there for him doubts their own value at times as well. When David is challenged to look inward and put his own issues aside so he can be there for someone else, his past fears and insecurities grip him with a stranglehold.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;David&amp;rsquo;s struggle with his past and doubts compel him to make decisions that he believes will lead to him feeling more sure of himself. And once more, though his intentions are to make his life better, David may not be spared the consequences of his actions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
