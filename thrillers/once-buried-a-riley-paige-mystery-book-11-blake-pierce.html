  <title>Once Buried (A Riley Paige Mystery—Book 11) - Blake Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“A masterpiece of thriller and mystery! The author did a magnificent job developing characters with a psychological side that is so well described that we feel inside their minds, follow their fears and cheer for their success. The plot is very intelligent and will keep you entertained throughout the book. Full of twists, this book will keep you awake until the turn of the last page.” 
--Books and Movie Reviews, Roberto Mattos (re Once Gone) 
ONCE BURIED is book #11 in the bestselling Riley Paige mystery series, which begins with the #1 bestseller ONCE GONE (Book #1)—a free download with over 1,000 five star reviews! 
A serial killer is killing victims with rapid speed, and in each crime scene, he leaves an unusual signature: an hourglass.
Its sand is designed to fall for 24 hours—and when its empty, a new victim appears.
Amidst intense media pressure, and in a frantic race against time, FBI Special Agent Riley Paige is summoned, with her new partner, to crack the case. Still reeling from the fallout with Shane, trying to sort out her family life, and to help Bill get back on his feet, Riley’s plate is already full. And as she enters the darkest canals of this twisted killer’s mind, this just may be the case that sets her over the edge.
A dark psychological thriller with heart-pounding suspense, ONCE BURIED is book #11 in a riveting new series—with a beloved new character—that will leave you turning pages late into the night. 
Book #12 in the Riley Paige series will be available soon." />
