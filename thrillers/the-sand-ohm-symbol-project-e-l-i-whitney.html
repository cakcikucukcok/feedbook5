  <title>The Sand (Ohm Symbol) Project - E.L.I. Whitney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For over a hundred years, the world has been at war with terrorism.  During the early part of the 21st century, a select group of radical Muslim countries from the Middle East has formed an Alliance.  This Alliance has but a single goal in mind: to eliminate the Infidels of the world by any means-every last man, woman and child.
But the world has been brought to its knee&#39;s after the detonation of three large nuclear devices by terrorists from the Alliance: three capitals-three governments: wiped off the face of the planet. 
   	A secret organization known to but a few as &quot;The Order&quot; has vowed to fight the final battle to eradicate the terrorist issue by the Alliance once and for all.  These countries leaders have forged a new pact and are preparing to fight back with the most deadly virus mankind has ever seen, a special virus, one that has been groomed to kill the enemy!  
	While on mission, operative Commander DC Rhodes comes across physical evidence that leads to the re-cultured and enhanced WWII virus that has just been used on a major Asian city by the Alliance.  After recovery of the remaining Nazi canisters from a remote mountaintop lake in the Swiss Alps, DC and his team are ordered by the American President and Chairmember of &quot;The Order&quot; to provide security of the canisters while enroute to the highly modernized top secret labs at South Pole Station and Russias Vostok Station on the Antarctic peninsula while he and his team are absorbed under The Orders wing.  
	As the Alliance unfolds its final plans to once and for all remove its enemies from the world; DC and his team are thrust into action to counter the world-wide threats as the virus they are escorting could be the worlds undoing as the use of this mutated virus could put the human race on the brink of a world-wide extinction." />
