  <title>Lasting Impressions - John Schlarbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the Town of Lasting, summer is typically a time to relax and enjoy the warm weather with family and friends. That was before the arrival of Dale Hawks. He has it all: good looks, great body and a killer smile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unknown to the mayor&amp;#39;s overachieving son Jeremy Atkins, the amicable hitchhiker he gives a ride to has a horrifying past. His ability to blend in with total strangers is almost supernatural. Jeremy&amp;#39;s girlfriend Susan soon finds that out, as does his secret admirer and his best friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the days get hotter, one thing becomes clear: Dale Hawks is more than a sociable drifter. He&amp;#39;s a mystical manipulator with a plan to bring the community to its knees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only question is can he escape his personal demons long enough to carry it out to its devastating conclusion?" />
