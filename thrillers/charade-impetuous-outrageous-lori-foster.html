  <title>Charade: Impetuous / Outrageous - Lori Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Love isn&#39;t always what it seems in these two timeless tales from New York Times bestselling author Lori Foster&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;IMPETUOUS&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When grade school teacher Carlie McDaniels trades in her frumpiness for an exotic harem girl Halloween costume, it&#39;s so long, spinsterhood–and hello, tall, dark and handsome Tyler Ramsey. But even after the best night of their lives, Tyler hasn&#39;t guessed the identity of his harem hottie…and Carlie plans on keeping him in the dark. After all, a gorgeous guy like Tyler would never fall for his smart-talking best friend. And Carlie&#39;s not sure what would happen if he ever unveiled the naked truth!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;OUTRAGEOUS&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Judd Sanders couldn&#39;t believe it when the beautiful, wide-eyed woman he&#39;d rescued from some drunk hoodlums started poking her gorgeous little nose into his business. She was obviously a menace to herself–not to mention to his libido. Worse, she&#39;d blow his cover. For little did Emily Cooper know that Judd was really a cop–whose feelings for Emily left him a little too uncovered for his liking.&lt;/p&gt;
