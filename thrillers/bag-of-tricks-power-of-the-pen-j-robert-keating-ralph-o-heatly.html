  <title>Bag of Tricks: Power of the Pen - J. Robert Keating, Ralph O. Heatly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With worldwide control of the Internet newly in its hands, the optimistically named Internet Fairness Service (IFS) is supposed to provide technological governance for the good of all. But from the shadows, a devious mastermind known only as Mr. S is pulling strings to manipulate the most ambitious insider trading scheme the world has ever known. When an IFS employee ends up dead after secretly tipping off struggling middle-aged journalist Henry Vanzant, Henry reluctantly finds himself drawn into a dangerous high-tech underworld.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are only two people Henry can trust to help him: edgy, Russian-born cyber security expert Alex, who might just turn out to be more than Henry can handle, and Karen, the beautiful and brilliant former college bandmate he always believed was out of his league.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Framed for the whistleblower&amp;rsquo;s murder, Henry must evade the FBI long enough to uncover the truth. Meanwhile, the corrupt and powerful Mr. S is setting dangerous forces in motion as he gets ever closer to staging his coupe.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With the security of the world&amp;rsquo;s financial markets in jeopardy and a target on his back, can Henry overcome his own demons and expose the real criminals in time?&lt;/p&gt;" />
