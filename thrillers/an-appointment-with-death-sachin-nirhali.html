  <title>An Appointment  with Death - Sachin Nirhali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amit Choudhary is a vile, unscrupulous builder of Thane, a bustling satellite city of Mumbai. Although married, itches to lay girls on and off. 
Vaishali Chitnis, a college-going girl, gets ensnared in his murky net, but suddenly, the tables turn and Amit finds himself at the receiving end. 
While there are many out there who are willing to give anything to see him dead, foremost among them is an eminent lawyer, Amrish Agarwal, who has an ax to grind against him. 
The lawyers hassled legal secretary, Ashu Kulkarni, has vowed to get to the root of the murky matter and send him packing from the legal firm. 
Suddenly Amit gets murdered in his Chandrama bungalow, sending shock waves throughout the city. 
And while the police are still on the lookout for the elusive killer, a blackmailer, out of the blue, appears on the scene. 
To make matters worse, a girl is suddenly found dead in mysterious circumstances beneath the secluded seven-story building. 
Time is running out for the police, who are still groping in the dark. They have to swoop down now on the killer, who is still at large, and apprehend him before the third murder rocks the city." />
