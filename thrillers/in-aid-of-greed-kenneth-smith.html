  <title>In Aid of Greed - Kenneth Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One hundred and fifty million dollars is a lot of money to give
away. It is an estimate of how much was paid out in foreign aid
last year. When it helps the sick, the starving, the homeless, the
deprived, we feel the money is well spent. But who knows how
much is pocketed by greedy gangsters and government officials,
in corruption or theft?
The origins cannot be traced of eighty percent of hospital drugs
in one large country. If you get sick you pay a lot of money for
treatment with such drugs, but how they got there, no one seems
to know. Those who own the hospitals just get rich.
From the south of France to Italy, London to the Russian Far
East, Marcus Black searches for someone who knows too much.
He finds passion and power, deceit and death. Whether it is
Italian omert or English discretion, so much is kept quiet. And
who can be trusted when big money is at stake." />
