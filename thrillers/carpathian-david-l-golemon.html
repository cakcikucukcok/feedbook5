  <title>Carpathian - David L. Golemon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Event Group tackles their most challenging mission yet in this no-holds-barred thrill ride from the&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Ripper&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Legacy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfect for fans of Clive Cussler, James Rollins, and Matthew Reilly, the latest gripping thriller from David L. Golemon takes the Event Group---the nation&#39;s most secret agency---to the brink in a heart-stopping race against time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;            Rumors of the seemingly magical victory that allowed the Exodus of Israelites from Egypt have resonated through the archaeological world for decades. Now evidence has been discovered that points to a new explanation of how the ancient Hebrews destroyed the unstoppable army of Pharaoh with a tribe of warriors who disappeared a generation later, after the destruction of the City of Jericho, taking with them the most valued treasures of a people without a homeland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today a treasure of a different kind is unearthed at the lost ruins of Jericho, one that will change the history of God&#39;s Chosen People for all time--the petrified remains of an animal that could not exist. Enter the Event Group. Led by Col. Jack Collins, the Group&#39;s brilliant men and women gather to discover the truth behind not only the Exodus, but also the magnificent animals that led the defeat of Pharaoh&#39;s army. On a whirlwind race to save the most valuable treasure and artifacts in the history of the world from those who would destroy them, the Event Group will come face-to-face with every myth, legend, and historical truth that has ever unfolded in the mythic and larger-than-life Carpathians---or as the area was once known, Transylvania, the land of Vlad the Impaler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest pulse-pounding installment in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Event Group Series, &lt;i&gt;Carpathian&lt;/i&gt; pushes the limits of suspense, where every chapter contains new twists and revelations in this exciting, page-turning read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
