  <title>Cowboy Pi (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Jean Barrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;COWBOY UNDER HER COVERS?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Driving cattle across mountainous Colorado terrain to gain an inheritance she didn&#39;t even want was not Samantha Howard&#39;s idea of a good time. Especially since someone was dead set against her inheriting her grandfather&#39;s ranch. A menacing presence overshadowed the drive, and the murderous threats against her became all too real….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then Roark Hawke, the lean-hipped, sexy rancher and sometime private investigator hired to protect her, ambled into her life. He was everything Samantha hated in a man–a cowboy with ranching in his blood. Neither one expected the irresistible passion that arose between them, even as the danger mounted. But when separated by a killer&#39;s last, desperate act, could Roark save the woman he had come to love?&lt;/p&gt;
