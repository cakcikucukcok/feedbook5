  <title>Blood Lies - Daniel Kalla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ben Dafoe, a young emergency-room doctor and part-time crime-scene consultant for the Seattle Police Department, is haunted by addiction. Two years earlier, a cocaine and crystal-meth habit claimed the life of his identical twin, Aaron. Now Ben walks onto the scene of a savage stabbing to find that the victim is his former fiancée, Emily Kenmore--another loved one who fell prey to drugs. Part of the carnage in Emily&#39;s bedroom is a single streak of blood caked on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the DNA from that sample matches Ben&#39;s, he becomes the prime suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convinced his identical twin is still alive and somehow involved in Emily&#39;s death, Ben goes on the run, aiming to find Aaron. Working under an assumed identity at an inner-city clinic, Ben desperately searches for Aaron while playing cat-and-mouse with the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But someone is determined to thwart his hunt at any cost. In the story&#39;s final twist, the truth hits closer to home and more lethally than Ben ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set against the backdrop of the ER, &lt;i&gt;Blood Lies&lt;/i&gt; is a medical thriller and a &lt;i&gt;Fugitive&lt;/i&gt;-style suspense novel with a major twist. As Ben struggles to solve a tragic mystery from his past and clear his name, he might just learn that, sometimes, blood lies. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
