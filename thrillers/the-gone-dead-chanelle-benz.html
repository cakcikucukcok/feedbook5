The house once belonged to her father, a renowned black poet who died unexpectedly when Billie was four years old. Though Billie was there when the accident happened, she has no memory of that day&amp;#8212;and she hasn&#39;t been back to the South since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;Thirty years later, Billie returns but her father&#39;s home is unnervingly secluded: her only neighbors are the McGees, the family whose history has been entangled with hers since the days of slavery. As Billie encounters the locals, she hears a strange rumor: that she herself went missing on the day her father died. As the mystery intensifies, she finds out that this forgotten piece of her past could put her in danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inventive, gritty, and openhearted, &lt;em&gt;The Gone Dead&lt;/em&gt; is an astonishing debut novel about race, justice, and memory that lays bare the long-concealed wounds of a family and a country.&lt;/p&gt;" />
