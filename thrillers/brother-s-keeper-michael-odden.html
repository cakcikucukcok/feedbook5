  <title>Brother’S Keeper - Michael Odden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When a string of racially motivated attacks hits someone close to him, homicidal pit boss Jennings Kavenaugh is out for revenge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennings Kavenaugh is a pit boss at the Royal Flush Casino in Detroit. His job affords him certain opportunities. After his father took his own life because of gambling debt, Jennings developed a real hatred for those harboring a gambling addiction. His position as pit boss allows him freedom to spot the addictsand eventually kill them, believing its for the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly, one of Jenningss closest friends is Detective Nate Jackson, who has no clue Jennings is the guy responsible for so many dead gamblers. Now, a string of racially motivated attacks perpetrated by a violent gang of young, white men catches the attention of the Motor City. Jennings wouldnt have gotten involved, but then the gang targets a member of Jenningss inner circle. While Nate investigates, Jennings plots revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jennings sets his personal agenda aside for the moment and tracks down the white supremacists intent on beating and humiliating Detroits minorities, he fears Nate might be onto him. If his best friend realizes the true nature of his murderous habits, things could get complicatedor deadly.&lt;/p&gt;" />
