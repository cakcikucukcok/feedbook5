  <title>Sick with Revenge - E. Vaughn Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sean Swoboda has it all: a bombshell wife in his rah-rah corner, a rock-solid investment portfolio, an irrefutable reputation for being the top DNA litigator in the country, and a sweet, tread-burning custom ride that stops traffic. Things couldnt be more epic in his life if he tried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when he receives an offer to join a celebrity prosecution team, hes torn. Accepting the offer would mean a happy wife, not to mention a golden chance to flaunt his resplendent DNA litigation skills in front of a national audience. It could also pay off in other ways, by delivering a much-needed way to strengthen waning relationships at his corporate job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the offer is a quintessential opportunity, the truth is that the timing couldnt be worse. Driven by a secret thats haunted him for nearly twenty years, he is too savvy not to fear the consequences that await if he bungles the situation. But is he willing to risk the price for so much fame and fortune? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision dips the stalwart attorney neck-deep into deviltry, danger, and death. Burdened by the choices he made both long ago and recently, Sean Swoboda soon finds himself on the run, guarding his client, his secretand his life. &lt;/p&gt;" />
