  <title>Sweet Amber - William Lynes, Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is New Years Eve at University of Texas Medical Branch as Dr. Lee W. Hickok locks his office door, plops in his leather chair, and pours two fingers of Jim Beam over one finger of ice. A short time later, Dr. Hickok is awakened by his pager defiantly vibrating, summoning him to the operating room. After he downs his last swallow of the liquid sweet amber, the functioning alcoholic urologist grabs his white coat and heads down a dark hallway to put his surgical skills to the test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he manages to control a patients bleeding and save his kidney, Dr. Hickok learns the man on the operating table is a prominent Texas citizen. While the patient is moved to the recovery room, Dr. Hickok has another stiff drink and then heads home. But when he is arrested for DWI, Dr. Hickok begins a downward spiral that not only includes his arrest, but also the death of the patient days later. As Dr. Hickoks alcoholism is revealed, he is blamed for the patients untimely end. Will he be able to face the truth about himself or drown in the darkness of addiction? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet Amber shares the compelling tale of an alcoholic surgeons life, the tragic consequences of his choices, and his journey to redemption.&lt;/p&gt;" />
