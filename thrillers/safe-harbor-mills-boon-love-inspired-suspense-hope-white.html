        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When he finds Nicole Harris cowering in a closet—a terrified witness to murder—Detective Alex Donovan’s only priority is keeping the beautiful redhead alive. But Nicole is harboring a deep, dark secret–a childhood trauma that stops her from counting on anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Haunted by the violence in his own past, Alex knows he shouldn’t get personally involved, but his own feelings blindside him. With a killer targeting Nicole as his next victim, his toughest road is still ahead. Somehow, he’s got to convince her to trust him with her life . . . and her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
