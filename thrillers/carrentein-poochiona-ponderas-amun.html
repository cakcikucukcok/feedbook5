Summary:
Carrentein Ponderas is a black a familys need and desire to survive in the rat race by any means necessary. From the unity, compassion, and guts of some to help others succeed arose what became known as the Black Mafia. Led by C.C.P., a mirror of S.B., he sprung up to become a shady tree for others, and with a heart bigger than they were that bred, a.k.a. urban legends, where cash ruled then, now, and forevermore.
