  <title>Bloodline in Chiaroscuro - Gloria H. Giroux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Danziger was a force to be reckoned with in both his personal and professional lives. From the 1940s to the 1980s, he ruled a business empire, his family, and his friends with an iron fist. An enigmatic man with warring dark and light sides, he eschewed playing by the rules and did anything to accomplish what he wantedeven murder.
However, James didnt just rise from ashes. He was born, he had parents, and he grew up, but what kind of people would create such an ambitious man beyond redemption? In the early 1900s, a chance meeting between Scottish immigrant Elspeth McMorgan and Stefan Danziger occurred, which set into motion a dynasty that would rule the better part of a century.
Jamess parents witnessed a great many amazing events, including the sinking of the Titanic, the suffragette movement, Prohibition, and the Great Depression before things went mad in the dark days of World War II. Through it all, the Danziger clan thrived even when the post-war fifties and sixties collided and planted the seed of power that continues to make its mark in the new millennium." />
