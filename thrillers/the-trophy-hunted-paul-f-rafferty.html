  <title>The Trophy Hunted - Paul F. Rafferty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="(T)he author penned this revenge thriller in the vein of a Twilight Zone  episode that turns the tables on trophy hunters.                                                            BlueInk Reviews
A gruesome tale that clearly and passionately condemns trophy hunting.  
Kirkus Reviews 
&lt;p&gt;Jack is a husband, father, and chiropractor from Wisconsin who, every year, travels to Africa to satisfy his thirst for killing as a trophy hunter, even though his wife does not approve of his habit. However, the tables are turned when Jack is drugged and whisked away to a secret ranch where he finds himself with two other trophy hunters whove met the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To his horror, Jack learns that he and his new friends are now the hunted. Weaponless and without food or water, they must pit themselves against skilled bow hunters who pursue them as if they were no more valuable than the animals they themselves had killed. The three struggle to outwit their killers and run for their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ordeal forces Jack to question his passion for killing animals just for the sake of sport. Separated from his family, and with his life hanging in the balance, he begins to see himself as no less of a monster than the men who now seek to murder him for sport. Gutted by guilt, he desperately tries to escape so that he can return to his family and make things right. Will Jack be able to escape his captors alive, and if so, will his life ever be the same again?&lt;/p&gt;" />
