  <title>Perfect Assassin (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Spy Games, Book 2) - Wendy Rosnau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;With the world&#39;s most wanted assassin behind bars, the good men of ONYXX could relax. Until the killing started again–and every shot bore the mark of the master. But that was impossible…wasn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Beautiful and mysterious, Prisca Reznik had been trained by the best. And now it was time for her to polish off the men on her father&#39;s kill file–beginning with Jacy &quot;Moon&quot; Madox, the man who&#39;d supposedly killed her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when she crash-landed into his backyard, Moon seemed to target her as the love of his life. Soon–when Prisca realized who Moon was–she would be targeting him, too. For very different reasons…&lt;/p&gt;
