  <title>Peas in the Garden - Jack Caymen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Huey Cantrell Martin is a black teen who grows up on the mean, unforgiving streets of the south side of Chicago. Despite having a good single parent mother to raise him constantly in the church life, Huey wants to learn the pulse of the street life and he does. After a few years of hustling on the streets Huey comes face to face with a crime he didnt commit. Facing jail time Huey is seeming miraculously given the choice of military or jail. After deciding on the military, Huey accepts the challenge to become all that he can be. After excelling at everything including being exceptional at marksmanship, Huey does his year in the Gulf War. Later Huey is adopted into the clan destined, off the record (ORGANIZATION) which is offset of the CIA. Hueys mentor is hard, mysterious and very dangerous. After three years in the organization, Huey decides to go back to the streets of Chicago as a detective but fate intervenes when the person he had grown to hate and fear, his mentor calls him out of the blue for one last mission with the organization. This mission would take Huey across the world to an uncertain ending to rescue a Senators wife from a terrorist sect.
An interesting novel with twist and turns that puts Huey in the fight for his life and the woman he seeks to rescue. With past demons and present dangers to deal with, how will Huey get through it all.
