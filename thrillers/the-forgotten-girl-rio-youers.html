  <title>The Forgotten Girl - Rio Youers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nominated for the 2018 Arthur Ellis Award for Best Crime Novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dark mystery unfolds in Rio Youers&#39;s riveting thriller, &lt;i&gt;The Forgotten Girl&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvey Anderson is a twenty-six-year-old street performer from New Jersey. He enjoys his peaceful life, but everything turns upside down when he is abducted and beaten by a group of nondescript thugs. Working for a sinister man known as &quot;the spider,&quot; these goons have spent nine years searching for Harvey&#39;s girlfriend, Sally Starling. Now they think they know where she lives. And whom she loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There&#39;s only one problem: Sally is gone and Harvey has no memory of her. Which makes no sense to him, until the spider explains that Sally has the unique ability to selectively erase a person&#39;s memories--an ability she has used to delete herself from Harvey&#39;s mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But emotion runs deeper than memory, and Harvey realizes he still feels something for Sally. And so--with the spider threatening--he goes looking for a girl he loves but can&#39;t remember . . . and encounters a danger that reaches beyond anything he could ever imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Political corruption and manipulation. A serial killer&#39;s dark secrets. An appetite for absolute, terrible power. For Harvey Anderson, finding the forgotten girl comes at quite a cost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
