  <title>Love&#39;s True Destiny - P. L. Byers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Isabella Walsh was alone in the world. Working full-time and attending the local college, her life was difficult but happy. Until the night she witnessed a police officer execute her boss, forcing her to leave the only place she called home in order to save her own life. Finally, exhausted from months of running, Isabella settles in a small town, but soon realizes the men searching for her have found her once again. Gathering what strength she has left, she fights back, only to collapse in a wooded area, cold, exhausted, and alone. 
Ethan Shay, a former member of the armys elite Special Forces unit, is happy with the quiet life he has chosen to lead. Finding a broken and bleeding unconscious woman was not something he anticipated, but finding her in the woods and knowing that someone had badly beaten her brings out his natural instinct to protect.
Shocked at her vehemence that he not call the police, Ethan takes her home to give her time to recover. When she finally tells him her story, it quickly becomes clear that it will take more than just his resources to help her. As they work together to uncover the mystery surrounding Isabella, they learn that the political ramifications of what she witnessed were only the beginning of what was truly happening. 
To stay alive, Isabella and Ethan will have to figure out how deeply her secrets go and whom, if anyone, they can trust. The decisions they make going forward could be costly, including whether or not they should stay together and forge a relationship they both desperately want. Its only when the bullets start to fly that their true relationship is put to the test." />
