  <title>The President&#39;s Jihadist - Harris Baseman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The nation has been shocked by the simultaneous murder of the President and all his successors, except for Ben Silver, an unpopular Cabinet Secretary. Silver, who many believe was involved in the murders, is the new president. A stunned Congress and Federal Bureaucracy are determined to get rid of Silver by any and all means possible. They are joined by Islamic jihadists who fear and hate Silver for religious and other reasons. The assassin who killed the former president offers to assist Silver as a double agent from within the jihadist movement. As the President attempts to prevent the country from collapsing into chaos, he must wrestle with the problems of accepting the intelligence assistance offered by the assassin. The assassin must himself wrestle with maintaining his position within the Islamic community, if he does in fact perform as offered. While practically everyone believes the assassin is dead, a very corrupt F.B.I. acting director and a woman who thinks she may be in love with the assassin are not so sure and both try to find him for their very different reasons." />
