      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Butch Dixon has been taken for a ride &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a jump in the car, see the sights kind of ride. He&amp;#39;s been taken for everything he has. He&amp;#39;s lost his house, his restaurant business, his savings, his car, his best friend, his faith&amp;#8212;all to his conniving ex-wife. But that was seven years ago. He picked himself up, left Chicago, and started over in Peoria, Arizona, running the Roundhouse Bar and Grill. He doesn&amp;#39;t look back on those bad years; there&amp;#39;s no point. Not until two curious cops show up at the Roundhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faith, Butch&amp;#39;s ex-wife, has been murdered, and the evidence points to him. Stunned, Butch quickly realizes that the black-hearted woman is going to ruin him again, from her grave. Lucky for Butch, the Old Blue Line, a group of retired&amp;#8212;but still sharp and tenacious&amp;#8212;former legal and law enforcement coots, have taken it upon themselves, as a favor, to make sure he doesn&amp;#39;t cross that thin line. After the dust settles, Butch&amp;#39;s life is again upended&amp;#8212;when a little red-haired ball of fire, Sheriff Joanna Brady, takes a seat at his bar.&lt;/p&gt;" />
