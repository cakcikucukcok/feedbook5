  <title>The Apocalypse Stone - Pete Earley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Judge not, lest ye be judged.&quot; &lt;br&gt;These words have rarely if ever crossed the mind of Aberlene county judge Evan Spencer. From a middle class background, he graduated law school, married into wealth, and now has his eye on a Supreme Court seat. All seemed to be going well for Judge Spencer, until he received a package from an old college friend he hadn&#39;t heard from in years containing a cryptic note and a small stone. But in trying to track down his old friend, Spencer learns of the man&#39;s suicidal leap from the roof off a 20-story balcony.&lt;br&gt;Evan Spencer now has control of an object whose power is beyond anything he could possibly imagine--an object whose very existence has been kept under wraps by the Vatican for decades. Spencer has been given the Apocalypse Stone: the actual stone Christ used when he stated &quot;He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone.&quot; Throughout history this stone has been passed along, inflicting its possessor with stigmatic wounds and vivid visions of their sinful life. &lt;br&gt;Enlisting the help of Reverend Angelo Grasso, a seventy-two year-old expert on the history of stigmatic cases, Spencer must uncover the secrets behind this strange stone, or watch his family, career, and possibly his life be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
