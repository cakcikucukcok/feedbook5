          &lt;strong&gt;THERE IS ONLY ONE MAN WHO CAN HELP YOU. IF HE&#39;LL TAKE YOUR CASE.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;–Victoria Colby of the Colby Agency to Rachel Larson, desperate mother&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;d heard his heart was as hard as his honed body and as cold as the steel of his gun. But the man called Sloan was Rachel Larson&#39;s last hope. She had nowhere left to hide from her son&#39;s father–a cold-blooded assassin, and Sloan&#39;s deadliest enemy. So she would face this lone wolf in his lair and plead for his help… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ex-agent Sloan lived only to take down the man who&#39;d killed all he loved. Now a desperate, desirable woman offered him that chance on a silver platter. Vengeance was his–if he could keep Rachel and her son from invading the fortress around his heart….&lt;/p&gt;
