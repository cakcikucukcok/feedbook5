  <title>Heartless - Danny Falcone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What happens when a serial killer has the mafia after him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a serial killer murders the sister of a big mob guy, the chase is on to catch him before the police do.  HEARTLESS takes you into the mind of a killer.  It reveals his thoughts and feelings before, during and after the kill.  It offers a brilliant perspective of the police detective&#39;s challenge, a chilling inside look at how the mafia operates, and the lengths they will go to catch the killer.  Follow the fear and apprehension of the beautiful Melissa Burke as she becomes the center of the insanity.  The mafia is after the killer.  The detective is after the killer, and the killer is after Melissa.  This cold-blooded pursuit peaks with a brutal ending when they all meet.   
Can the mafia outrun a street smart cop, especially when their mutual target is a cold-hearted serial killer in New York City who removes the hearts of his young beautiful victims like Melissa Burke? After she got a glimpse of him as he left a club with her best friend and then killed her, Melissa becomes the sole obsession of the killer&#39;s eye. His next victim is the sister of Rocky T a prominent mob captain.  The race begins between whether the street smart tough cop or the mafia will catch the killer before the killer cuts apart his next victim. This cat and mouse, blood spattered adventure peaks as the killer sets his sights on Melissa Burke. The pursuit of the killer leaves a heartless trail of victims and a blood thirsty spree as they all meet in a riveting standoff that forces a Machiavellian ending.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Heartless is Book Two in a series of four.&lt;/p&gt;" />
