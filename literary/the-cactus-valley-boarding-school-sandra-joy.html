  <title>The Cactus Valley Boarding School - Sandra Joy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kathlyn Farrel had never been away from home without her parents for more than a weekend, much less out of the country. So you can imagine her shock when her parents announce that they have decided to send her to boarding school in Dallas for a year. Her parents were both hard working people and hardly ever home, and with her brother in college, they had thought it best to send her to boarding school. The only good thing is, all three of her best friends are going, too.
     Once there, it doesn&#39;t take long to get into tons of trouble. Being accused of theft, and having a frustrating and impossible crush on the main handyman, who doesn&#39;t seem to be much of a handyman, doesn&#39;t make life any easier. Will Kathlyn&#39;s stubborn determination to catch the thief (on her own, if no one&#39;ll help her), get her expelled? Or worse, break her friendship with her three best friends?
     Follow Kathlyn as she proves to everyone that she&#39;s innocent. Once more, she learns to trust, and she learns that not everyone is out to get her, as she was starting to believe. And she once again learns to be her own joyful self again." />
