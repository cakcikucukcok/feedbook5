  <title>Baby Dreams And Wedding Schemes (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - C.J. Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;TO HAVE A FAMILY OF HER OWN…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Perpetually single Sasha Lambert would do anything to have a baby. But days before her trip to the sperm bank she met a lonely little boy…and his irresistible father. Despite widower Jacob Windsor&#39;s announcement that he was not interested in marriage, Sasha could see he desperately needed some help with his adorable son.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What choice did a natural-born do-gooder have? Sasha would help father and son to reconnect, gaining some invaluable lessons on mommyhood. And hope that when the time came, one very determined single dad would agree to grant her baby wish…and maybe a trip to the altar, as well!&lt;/p&gt;
