  <title>A Conspiracy of Dunces - Bill Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Conspiracy of Dunces, the third in Shaw&#39;s Pistol Thicket trilogy, is a rollicking send-up of John Kennedy Toole&#39;s 1980 Pullitzer Prize winning A Confederacy of Dunces.  Ignatius P. Reilly, a product of Ignatius J&#39;s New Orleans neighborhood, is a 270 pound college star whose NFL destiny is sidetracked by a football injury.  Not to be diminished, I.P. is sped upon a godly mission by his church, Trinity Baptist of Pistol Thicket, La., to install an evangelical president in the White House.  Along the way, he is assailed by two liberal Marxist Occupy-DC beauties -- Lizza Sachs and Myrna Minkoff -- who make his life a political hell until . . . love happens.  Ignatius P stretches his luck and his madcap schemes about as far as can be done as he works himself into the Bachmann campaign while countering the vicious assaults from Lizza and Myrna.  Ignatius P. is supported by Tim Sorenson, a Marine veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, and Jim Loughlin, a Bachmann operative.  But wait . . . but wait . . . there&#39;s a big election night party, November 6, 2012, in Charleston.  Readers will be overwhelmed by the unexpected!!!" />
