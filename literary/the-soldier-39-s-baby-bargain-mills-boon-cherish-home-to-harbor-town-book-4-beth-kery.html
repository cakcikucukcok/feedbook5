          &lt;strong&gt;UNEXPECTEDLY EXPECTING! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She’d been his best friend’s wife…then widow, and Air Force pilot Ryan Itani had been captivated by Faith Holmes even before they met. They say grief makes people do crazy things – well, sleeping with Faith was one of them. But then Ryan found out she was carrying his baby…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Faith wasn’t about to let him into her heart. If there was any chance to be part of her and their child’s life, Ryan had to prove he wasn’t just another carefree flyboy. Ryan had risked life and limb before, but this was about to become his most important mission yet!&lt;/p&gt;
