Or is he?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat spent endless hours chain-smoking and propping up the counter of Sullivan&#39;s Select Bar (not that Mrs. McNab knew anything about it&amp;#8212;she and Timmy the barman didn&#39;t get along at all) or sitting on his mother&#39;s knee singing away together like some ridiculous two-headed human jukebox.
