  <title>Paradise Dogs - Man Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Adam Newman once had it all. But then he lost it. &lt;br&gt;Now Adam yearns to reunite with his estranged wife, Evelyn, and recapture the Edenic life they once had running Paradise Dogs, the roadside hot-dog restaurant now legendary throughout central Florida.&lt;br&gt;He has a few obstacles along the way. For starters, there&#39;s his impending marriage to Lily. There&#39;s also the matter of a quarter million dollars&#39; worth of diamonds that he mislaid, along with what appears to be a shadowy conspiracy that is buying up land around the Cross-Florida Canal (and which may or may not be a product of Adam&#39;s alcohol-infused imagination).&lt;br&gt;Despite his own troubles---and a brief stay in Chattahoochee---Adam looks to mentor his son, Addison, in the ways of love. Awkward, unsure, and employed as the world&#39;s least accurate obituary writer, Addison pines for a beautiful and painfully earnest linguistic student but must compete for her attention with his older and more sophisticated half brother from Evelyn&#39;s first marriage.&lt;br&gt;But if anybody can set these worlds in order, it is Adam, who has an uncanny knack for being in the right place at the right time and allowing others to believe he&#39;s someone he&#39;s not. Whether it&#39;s delivering a baby, rescuing a marriage, or exposing a Communist conspiracy, our protagonist is up for the job. &lt;i&gt;Paradise Dogs, &lt;/i&gt;from Georgia Author of the Year Award winner Man Martin, is a farcical tale of paradise lost, the American Dream, and the true measures of love&lt;/p&gt;" />
