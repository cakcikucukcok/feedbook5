  <title>Out With The Old, In With The New (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Nancy Robards Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Ask your husband what he&#39;s been doing all those nights he claimed to be at the hospital…&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The aforementioned suggestion would never be welcomed by any woman who&#39;d been married for the better (well, mostly) part of twenty years. But for Kate Hennessey, who was celebrating turning forty by taking a fabulous vacation with her two best friends, the timing was not the best.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Does she go, or does she stay?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;ll get the answer soon enough. And though her world may be rocked, maybe she can cope better than we think. Because design is her business, after all. You know, changing things around and putting the pieces together in a whole new way….&lt;/p&gt;
