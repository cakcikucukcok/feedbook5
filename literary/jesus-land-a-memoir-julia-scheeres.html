  <title>Jesus Land: A Memoir - Julia Scheeres</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The memoir the &lt;I&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/I&gt; called &quot;heart-stopping and enraging&quot; and about which Entertainment Weekly raved &quot;Jesus &lt;I&gt;Land&lt;/I&gt; will break your heart and mend it again&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Sinners go to: HELL. Rightchuss go to: HEAVEN. The end is neer: REPENT. This here is: JESUS LAND.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Julia Scheeres stumbles across these signs along the side of a cornfield while out biking with her adopted brother David. It&#39;s the mid-1980s, they&#39;re sixteen years old, and have just moved to rural Indiana, a landscape of cottonwood trees and trailer parks--and a racism neither of them is prepared for. While Julia is white, her close relationship with David, who&#39;s black, makes them both outcasts. At home, a distant mother--more involved with her church&#39;s missionaries than with her own children--and a violent father only compound their problems. When the day comes that high-school hormones, racist brutality, and a deep-seated restlessness prove too much to bear, their parents&#39; solution is reform school--in the Dominican Republic.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this riveting memoir, first-time author Scheeres takes us with her from the Midwest to a place beyond imagining. Surrounded by natural beauty, the Escuela Caribe is nonetheless characterized by a disciplinary regime that demands its teens repent for their sins under boot-camp conditions. Julia and David&#39;s striving to make it through is told here with startling immediacy, extreme candor, and not an ounce of malice.&lt;/div&gt;" />
