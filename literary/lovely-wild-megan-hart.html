  <title>Lovely Wild - Megan Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From New York Times bestselling author Megan Hart comes a haunting and insightful novel about a woman trying to find her place in the world&amp;#133;&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Brought up in the savage captivity of her unstable grandmother&#39;s rural Pennsylvania home, Mari Calder once yearned for rescue. Now she struggles every day to function as an adult in the confines of normal society. Left with only a foggy recollection of her childhood, she&#39;s consumed with being a dutiful wife to her husband, Ryan, and mother to their two children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;But an unexpected twist of events returns her to that long-forgotten house in the woods. Soon, Mari is greeted with reminders of a past life, the clarified memories only inviting a new level of strangeness into her fragile world. To protect her family, she must find the beautiful, powerful strength hidden in her inner chaos. Because someone is bent on exploiting Mari&#39;s trauma, and as normal and wild begin to blend, a string of devastating truths force Mari to question all she thought she knew.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&amp;#34;Haunting, devastating, heart-wrenching.&amp;#34; &amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&amp;#151;RT Book Reviews on Precious and Fragile Things" />
