  <title>The Oddity - Kat Hawthorne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You know all those stories you&#39;ve read about fair maidens trapped in high towers by evil caretakers, forced to do hard manual labour until their fingers are worn to mere nubs?   How about the ones starring charming knights who risk life and limb to bravely rescue those who have been wronged? Is that what you&#39;re looking for?  Well, I&#39;m sorry to disappoint, but this is not that kind of book.  What if our heroine is actually a genetically engineered monster capable of great destruction? What if the scientist who invented her really is mad? What if the caretaker actually has a legitimate reason for locking the fair maiden up? And what if our charming prince is really a snivelling brat who can&#39;t talk his way out of a paper bag...or yet another jail cell?  Based on the Tarot and rich with thoughts on life and death, right and wrong, betrayal and...the opposite of betrayal, Kat Hawthorne&#39;s The Oddity is like no other book you&#39;ve ever read." />
