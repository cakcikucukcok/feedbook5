  <title>Fishing for Bacon - Michael Davie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My name&#39;s Bacon Sobelowski, and I&#39;m trying to find my someone. Kenny Rogers sings a song that says there&#39;s someone for everyone, and in Bellevue where I live, Kenny Rogers&#39; word is gold. It&#39;s just too bad my mother thinks girls turn boys into pigs, but that&#39;s probably just because my father had enough of her Eggos and walked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But maybe she&#39;s right. I&#39;m not sure if Sarah is my someone because she got mad and smashed chili peppers into a cut on my head, and maybe my someone wouldn&#39;t do that. Karla could be it because she lets me stay at her condo, but she might be too old to be my someone. Then there&#39;s Mr. Kwon&#39;s daughter, but she&#39;s sort of my cousin and I&#39;m not sure if sort-of cousins can be someones at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it might all come down to timing, and if that&#39;s true then I&#39;m in trouble. I&#39;m Bacon Sobelowski - who knows if I&#39;ll ever find my someone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Fishing for Bacon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The dialogue maintains a nice rhythm for humorous emphases, the gags are well placed and developed, and the plot keeps all its balls in the air for the duration. . . [it] makes for a fun ride, with many laughs along the way.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ &lt;i&gt;Quill and Quire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Bacon&#39;s story, told in the first person, is funny but painful, not unlike adolescence itself ... Davie&#39;s ability to create bizarre, intriguing and yet believable circumstances make this a unique story. &lt;i&gt;Fishing for Bacon&lt;/i&gt; is a charming and promising debut.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ &lt;i&gt;Alberta Views&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A sudden burst of comic energy that, like a field of canola on the Prairie, just goes on and on ... It&#39;s also fun to watch Davie, whose first novel this is, exercise a love of the unlikely that boots him out of the predictable and into fresher and much suppler territory. [Davie] has placed himself squarely in the tradition of various classic Prairie writers.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ &lt;i&gt;National Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
