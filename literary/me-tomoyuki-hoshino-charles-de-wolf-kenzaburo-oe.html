  <title>ME - Tomoyuki Hoshino, Charles De Wolf, Kenzaburo Oe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&quot;Mr. Hoshino&amp;#8217;s superb talent allows for a development of the richly imaginative details that is completely natural, without any hint of forced contrivances . . . There is a clear distinction to be seen here between &lt;I&gt;ME&lt;/I&gt; and the sort of television drama or potboiler fiction already available that take up telephone fraud as a social topic. Nor does the novel allow itself to slip into simplistic allegory. The weight of reality it creates reflects the substantiality of the author&amp;#8217;s prowess. [Chapters 3 and 4] surpass even Kobo Abe, Japan&amp;#8217;s great forerunner in the power of literary thought. The author has leaped to a higher level.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;B&gt;Kenzaburo Oe&lt;/B&gt;, Nobel Prize&amp;#150;winning author of &lt;I&gt;The Silent Cry&lt;/I&gt;, from the afterword&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Tomoyuki Hoshino&amp;#8217;s &lt;I&gt;ME&lt;/I&gt; is a daring literary triumph, unlike any book you&amp;#8217;re likely to read this year or any other. Inventive, absurd, and thrilling, Hoshino draws upon the work of a wide array of literary masters--Abe, Camus, Vonnegut, and Chandler--to create a character and world that&amp;#8217;s wholly unique. A thoughtful, somewhat surreal exploration of the darkest self-reflexive tendencies of this modern moment. I strongly recommend it.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--&lt;B&gt;Joe Meno&lt;/B&gt;, author of &lt;I&gt;Marvel and a Wonder&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;There is more than a little of a great episode of&amp;#160;&lt;I&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#160;in Tomoyuki Hoshino&amp;#8217;s funny, frightening&amp;#160;&lt;I&gt;ME&lt;/I&gt;. But&amp;#160;&lt;I&gt;ME&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#160;is considerably more than a clever premise, and as I moved deeper into mental and physical dislocation alongside its hero, I felt my own sense of reality being pulled apart. Hoshino&amp;#8217;s sharp, understated prose, in Charles De Wolf&amp;#8217;s excellent translation, is what makes this incredible journey possible. The whole is both pleasurable and profound.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;B&gt;Laird Hunt&lt;/B&gt;, author of&amp;#160;&lt;I&gt;The Evening Road&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This novel centers on the &amp;#147;It&amp;#8217;s me&amp;#8221; telephone scam&amp;#151;often targeting the elderly&amp;#151;that has escalated in Japan in recent years. Typically, the caller identifies himself only by saying, &amp;#147;Hey, it&amp;#8217;s me,&amp;#8221; and goes on to claim in great distress that he&amp;#8217;s been in an accident or lost some money with which he was entrusted at work, etc., and needs funds wired to his account right away.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;ME&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#8217;s narrator is a nondescript young Tokyoite named Hitoshi Nagano who, on a whim, takes home a cell phone that a young man named Daiki Hiyama accidentally put on Hitoshi&amp;#8217;s tray at McDonald&amp;#8217;s. Hitoshi uses the phone to call Daiki&amp;#8217;s mother, pretending he is Daiki, and convinces her to wire him 900,000 yen.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Three days later, Hitoshi returns home from work to discover Daiki&amp;#8217;s mother there in his apartment, and she seems to truly believe Hitoshi is her son. Even more bizarre, Hitoshi discovers his own parents now treat him as a stranger; they, too, have a &amp;#147;me&amp;#8221; living with them as Hitoshi. At a loss for what else to do, Hitoshi begins living as Daiki, and no one seems to bat an eye.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In a brilliant probing of identity, and employing a highly original style that subverts standard narrative forms, Tomoyuki Hoshino elevates what might have been a commonplace crime story to an occasion for philosophical reflection. In the process, he offers profound insights into the state of contemporary Japanese society.&lt;/div&gt;" />
