      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author! A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Best Seller! &lt;i&gt;Goodreads&lt;/i&gt; Choice Award Winner for Best Fiction of 2014! An Indie Next Pick!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Eleanor &amp; Park&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fangirl&lt;/i&gt;, Rainbow Rowell, comes a hilarious, heart-wrenching take on love, marriage, and magic phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgie McCool knows her marriage is in trouble. That it&#39;s been in trouble for a long time. She still loves her husband, Neal, and Neal still loves her, deeply-but that almost seems beside the point now.&lt;br&gt;Maybe that was always beside the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days before they&#39;re supposed to visit Neal&#39;s family in Omaha for Christmas, Georgie tells Neal that she can&#39;t go. She&#39;s a TV writer, and something&#39;s come up on her show; she has to stay in Los Angeles. She knows that Neal will be upset with her-Neal is always a little upset with Georgie-but she doesn&#39;t expect to him to pack up the kids and go without her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her husband and the kids leave for the airport, Georgie wonders if she&#39;s finally done it. If she&#39;s ruined everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That night, Georgie discovers a way to communicate with Neal in the past. It&#39;s not time travel, not exactly, but she feels like she&#39;s been given an opportunity to fix her marriage before it starts. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that what she&#39;s supposed to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or would Georgie and Neal be better off if their marriage never happened?&lt;/p&gt;" />
