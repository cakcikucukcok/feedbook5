  <title>Nude Walker - Bathsheba Monk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the most beautiful things in the world are things in flux,&quot; says Kat Warren-Bineki, the heroine of &lt;i&gt;Nude Walker&lt;/i&gt;. Everything about Kat&#39;s world is in flux. She hails from Warrenside, Pennsylvania, a once prosperous town named after her mother&#39;s family. With the death of the steel industry, Warrenside has fallen on hard times; when its economy falters, Kat and her parents are among the few citizens still eking out a living there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there&#39;s Kat&#39;s love life. As the young, beautiful granddaughter of a proud old-guard industrialist, she has plenty of suitors and a longtime boyfriend; certainly she has no business falling in love with Max Asad. After all, Max is the aloof only son of a newly arrived Lebanese entrepreneur who, despite the resistance of Warrenside&#39;s traditionalists, has bought up most of its dilapidated downtown and is trying to get it off life support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Max and Kat return from Afghanistan, where both served with the National Guard, they share a series of intriguing encounters, and soon neither can deny that their romance has changed them. Kat forfeits her social standing by declaring love for a bitterly resented foreigner, and when Max&#39;s heart wins out, he jeopardizes his father&#39;s dreams for a brighter, better Warrenside. As their families feud (sometimes comically, sometimes ferociously), the old town braces for an epic flood, and the city&#39;s denizens try frantically to realize their ambitions--with love, lust, insurance fraud, hallucinations . . . any means of outrunning their obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, &lt;i&gt;Nude Walker&lt;/i&gt; is a story of forbidden love seen through the prism of post-industrial America. Bathsheba Monk writes with flinty wit and warm spirit, but she&#39;s unlike other writers we know. In a voice as true as it is disarming, she depicts the kaleidoscopic tensions between generations and cultures. As &lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt; said about her, &quot;Monk makes us see that we are all exiles in a changing world.&quot; In &lt;i&gt;Nude Walker&lt;/i&gt;, she offers an unlikely romance about the fantastical myths we weave to define ourselves in unmoored times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
