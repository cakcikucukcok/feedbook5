  <title>Four Friends - Robyn Carr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;From #1 New York Times bestselling author Robyn Carr comes the story of four friends determined to find their stride. Ultimately, they&#39;ll discover what it means to be a wife, mother, lover, friend…and most important: your true self.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gerri can&#39;t decide what&#39;s more devastating: learning her rock-solid marriage has big cracks, or the anger she feels as she tries to repair them. Always the anchor for friends and her three angst-ridden teenagers, it&#39;s time to look carefully at herself. The journey is more than revealing–it&#39;s transforming.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Andy doesn&#39;t have a great track record with men, and she&#39;s come to believe that a lasting love is out of reach. When she finds herself attracted to her down-to-earth contractor–a man without any of the qualities that usually appeal to her–she questions everything she thought she wanted in life.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sonja&#39;s lifelong pursuit of balance is shattered when her husband declares he&#39;s through with her New Age nonsense and walks out. There&#39;s no herbal tonic or cleansing ritual that can restore her serenity–or her sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Miraculously, it&#39;s BJ, the reserved newcomer to Mill Valley, who steps into their circle and changes everything. The woman with dark secrets opens up to her neighbors, and together they get each other back on track, stronger as individuals and unfaltering as friends.&lt;/p&gt;
