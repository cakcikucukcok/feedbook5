  <title>Red Clocks - Leni Zumas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In this ferociously imaginative novel, abortion is once again illegal in America, in-vitro fertilization is banned, and the Personhood Amendment grants rights of life, liberty, and property to every embryo.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Five women. One question. What is a woman for?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In a small Oregon fishing town, five very different women navigate these new barriers alongside age-old questions surrounding motherhood, identity, and freedom. Ro, a single high-school teacher, is trying to have a baby on her own, while also writing a biography of Eivv?r, a little-known 19th-century female polar explorer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Susan is a frustrated mother of two, trapped in a crumbling marriage.  Mattie is the adopted daughter of doting parents and one of Ro&#39;s best students, who finds herself pregnant with nowhere to turn. And Gin is the gifted, forest-dwelling herbalist, or &quot;mender,&quot; who brings all their fates together when she&#39;s arrested and put on trial in a frenzied modern-day witch hunt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Red Clocks&lt;/i&gt; is at once a riveting drama, whose mysteries unfold with magnetic energy, and a shattering novel of ideas. In the vein of Margaret Atwood and Eileen Myles, Leni Zumas fearlessly explores the contours of female experience, evoking &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid&#39;s Tale&lt;/i&gt; for a new millennium. This is a story of resilience, transformation, and hope in tumultuous -- even frightening -- times." />
