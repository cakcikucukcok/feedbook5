  <title>Ballroom - Alice Simpson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Told in interconnecting stories, &lt;em&gt;Ballroom&lt;/em&gt; is a beautifully crafted debut novel&amp;#8212;reminiscent of the works of Elizabeth Strout and Jennifer Haigh&amp;#8212;about a group of strangers united by a desire to escape their complicated lives, if only for a few hours each week, in a faded New York City dance hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time has eroded the glamour of the Ballroom, but at the end of the 1990s, a small crowd of loyal patrons still makes its way past the floor-to-ceiling columns which frame the once grand hall each Sunday evening. Sweeping across the worn parquet floor under a peeling indigo ceiling, these men and women succumb to the magic of the music, looking for love and connection, eager to erase the drab reality of their complicated lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly forty and still single, Sarah Dreyfus is desperate for love and sure she&amp;#8217;ll find it with debonair Gabriel Katz, a dazzling peacock who dances to distract himself from his crumbling marriage. Tired of the bachelor life, Joseph believes that his yearning for a wife and family will be fulfilled&amp;#8212;if only he can get Sarah to notice him. Besotted with beautiful young Maria Rodriguez, elderly dance instructor Harry Korn knows they can find happiness together. Maria, one of the Ballroom&amp;#8217;s stars, has a dream of her own, a passion her broken-hearted father refuses to accept or understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the rhythms of the Ballroom ebb and flow through these characters&amp;#8217; hearts, their fates come together in touching, unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
