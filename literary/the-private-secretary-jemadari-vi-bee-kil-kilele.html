  <title>The Private Secretary - Jemadari Vi-Bee-Kil Kilele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Private Secretary is an explosive and action-packed drama.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It excels in exposing endemic evils of our modern society in all its profundity. To some extent, it shows that the misbehaviour of an individual can cause a chain-reaction in the milieu that he dwells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mr. Maseko is the epitome of a boss who uses his fiscal power to act as it pleases him. He breaks teenagers&#39; hearts and braggarts within the human society as an untouchable. While he is away on &quot;business errands&quot;, his private secretary; Ms Dada faces a mamouth task in shielding all the assaults launched by his multiple ennemies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Through different scenes and acts, anyone who behaves like Mr Maseko discovers a kind of truth tha scathes one&#39;s ears and that becomes consciously unbearable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The comical ingredients in the opening scene may lead the reader astray; but as one progresses, one discovers that the book is indeed  provocative, acerbic, daring and satirical. It is a portrait of character.
&lt;/p&gt;
