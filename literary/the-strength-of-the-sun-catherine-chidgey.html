  <title>The Strength of the Sun - Catherine Chidgey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A mysterious letter-writing campaign bears unexpected consequences in this gifted young writer&#39;s intimate exploration of loss and discovery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every contact leaves a trace. But when Colette receives a letter from The Friends of Patrick Mercer about a man lying unconscious in a hospital on the other side of the world, she has no idea who the man might be. Why is she being written to?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitalized in England after a car accident, medievalist Patrick Mercer reconstructs his life through memory, dreams, and the inspiration of his treasured illuminated manuscripts. Half a world away, Colette is adjusting to new classes, a new apartment, a new job-and the mysterious &quot;Patrick&quot; letters that keep arriving. Meanwhile, Ruth and Malcolm-whose young son is Colette&#39;s charge-are desperately seeking to pick up the pieces of their lives after the terrifying disappearance of their teenage daughter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Strength of the Sun&lt;/i&gt; is a novel about the human desire to make connections, to pick through our lives in search of what can be found among the daily losses. Compassionate, beautifully written, and compelling to the final page, &lt;i&gt;The Strength of the Sun &lt;/i&gt;introduces talented new writer Catherine Chidgey to American readers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
