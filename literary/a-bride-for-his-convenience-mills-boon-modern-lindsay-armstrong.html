          &lt;em&gt;For Convenience–Or For Real?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rob Leicester&#39;s wealth was matched by his arrogance. Initially Caiti found working for the millionaire Australian resort owner tough. But hostility turned to attraction and virginal Caiti gave Rob everything. She was overjoyed when he proposed that they wed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, Caiti&#39;s joy turned to shame when she discovered that Rob had married her purely for reasons of convenience. Her only option was to leave and build a new life elsewhere. But Rob wasn&#39;t about to let her go. As soon as an opportunity arose, he was in Caiti&#39;s life again, ready to claim her–but, this time, as his wife for &lt;em&gt;real!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
