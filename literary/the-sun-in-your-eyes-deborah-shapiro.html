And if you were with her, I&amp;#8217;d always thought, you could walk into any room.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For quiet, cautious and restless college freshman Vivian Feld real life begins the day she moves in with the enigmatic Lee Parrish&amp;#8212;daughter of died-too-young troubadour Jesse Parrish and model-turned-fashion designer Linda West&amp;#8212;and her audiophile roommate Andy Elliott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a one-night stand fractures Lee and Andy&amp;#8217;s intimate rapport, Lee turns to Viv, inviting her into her glamorous fly-by-night world: an intoxicating mix of Hollywood directors, ambitious artists, and first-class everything. It is the beginning of a friendship that will inexorably shape both women as they embark on the rocky road to adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a decade later, Viv is married to Andy and hasn&amp;#8217;t heard from Lee in three years. Suddenly, Lee reappears, begging for a favor: she wants Viv to help her find the lost album Jesse was recording before his death.&amp;#160; Holding on to a life-altering secret and ambivalent about her path, Viv allows herself to be pulled into Lee&amp;#8217;s world once again.&amp;#160; But the chance to rekindle the magic and mystery of their youth might come with a painful lesson: While the sun dazzles us with its warmth and brilliance, it may also blind us from seeing what we really need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What begins as a familiar story of two girls falling under each other&amp;#8217;s spell evolves into an evocative, and at times irrepressibly funny, study of female friendship in all its glorious intensity and heartbreaking complexity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
