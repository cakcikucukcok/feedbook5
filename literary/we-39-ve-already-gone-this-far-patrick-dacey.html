  <title>We&#39;ve Already Gone This Far - Patrick Dacey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A heartfelt, vital collection; the debut of an exciting new talent already hailed as one of George Saunders&#39; &quot;favorite young American writers&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Patrick Dacey&#39;s stunning debut, we meet longtime neighbors and  friends--citizens of working-class Wequaquet--right when the ground  beneath their feet has shifted in ways they don&#39;t yet understand. Here,  after more than a decade of boom and bust, love and pride are closely  twinned and dangerously deployed: a lonely woman attacks a memorial to a  neighbor&#39;s veteran son; a dissatisfied housewife goes overboard with  cosmetic surgery on national television; a young father walks away from  one of the few jobs left in town, a soldier writes home to a mother who  is becoming increasingly unhinged. &lt;i&gt;We&#39;ve Already Gone This Far&lt;/i&gt;  takes us to a town like many towns in America, a place where people are  searching for what is now an almost out-of-reach version of the American  Dream&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Story by story, Dacey draws us into the secret lives of  recognizable strangers and reminds us that life&#39;s strange intensity and  occasional magic is all around us, especially in the everyday. With a  skewering insight and real warmth of spirit, Dacey delivers that rare  and wonderful thing in American fiction: a deeply-felt, deeply-imagined  book about where we&#39;ve been and how far we have to go.&lt;/p&gt;" />
