  <title>Compartment No. 6 - Rosa Liksom, Lola Rogers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the waning years of the Soviet Union, a sad young Finnish woman boards a train in Moscow. Bound for Mongolia, she&#39;s trying to put as much space as possible between her and a broken relationship. Wanting to be alone, she chooses an empty compartment--No. 6.--but her solitude is soon shattered by the arrival of a fellow passenger: Vadim Nikolayevich Ivanov, a grizzled, opinionated, foul-mouthed former soldier. Vadim fills the compartment with his long and colorful stories, recounting in lurid detail his sexual conquests and violent fights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a hint of menace in the air, but initially the woman is not so much scared of or shocked by him as she is repulsed. She stands up to him, throwing a boot at his head. But though Vadim may be crude, he isn&#39;t cruel, and he shares with her the sausage and black bread and tea he&#39;s brought for the journey, coaxing the girl out of her silent gloom. As their train cuts slowly across thousands of miles of a wintry Russia, where &quot;everything is in motion, snow, water, air, trees, clouds, wind, cities, villages, people and thoughts,&quot; a grudging kind of companionship grows between the two inhabitants of compartment No. 6. When they finally arrive in Ulan Bator, a series of starlit and sinister encounters bring Rosa Liksom&#39;s incantatory &lt;i&gt;Compartment No. 6 &lt;/i&gt;to its powerful conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
