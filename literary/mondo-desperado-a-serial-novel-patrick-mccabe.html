  <title>Mondo Desperado: A Serial Novel - Patrick McCabe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Patrick McCabe has long been recognized as a writer of rare talent and unique voice, whose vision of the world is so distinctive that &quot;McCabesque&quot; has become an adjective with multiple meanings, including &quot;exquisitely, beautifully, mad in the head!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a Booker Prize finalist for The Butcher Boy, which won the Irish Times Aer Lingus/Irish Literature Prize for Fiction and was made into a motion picture directed by Neil Jordan and cowritten by McCabe and Jordan. He was again a Booker Prize finalist for Breakfast on Pluto, which won the Spirit of Life Arts/Sunday Independent Irish Literature Award and was a number one international bestseller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCabe has been described as &quot;the lodestone of new Irish fiction&quot; (Wall Street Journal), &quot;a dark. genius of incongruity and the grotesque&quot; (Sunday Observer) and &quot;one of Ireland&#39;s finest living writers&quot; (New York Times Book Review).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minneapolis Star-Tribune commented on McCabe&#39;s &quot;remarkable...ability to induce compassion for the unlikeliest people,&quot; and in Mondo Desperado: A Serial Novel, that ability and the full range of his &quot;grotesque genius&quot; (Marie Claire) combine to produce a brilliant, macabre&#39; dementedly funny and surreally imagined fiction of intertwined narratives set in a small Irish town. McCabe himself has described Mondo Desperado as being &quot;like Sherwood Anderson&#39;s Winesburg, Ohio -- on drugs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his mondo tales of the insular town of Barntrosna, McCabe assembles a distinctly Irish crew of odd and unusual inhabitants who live on and regularly cross, often unconsciously, the border between fantasy and reality. In &quot;Hot Nights at the Go-Go Lounge,&quot; Larry Bunyan is certain his demure wife is secretly out at night with deadbeat swingers, shooting drugs and having wild sex, while in &quot;I Ordained the Devil,&quot; the Bishop of Barntrosna confesses that his ordination of Father Packie Cooley was really an ordination of His Satanic Majesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Barntrosna resident, Dr. John Joe Parkes, discovers &quot;The Valley of the Flying Jennets,&quot; the secret place in the mountains created by his Dr. Frankenstein -- type medical ancestor where his horrible, mutated genetic failures live. In the concluding &quot;Forbidden Love of Noreen Tiernan,&quot; Noreen escapes Barntrosna, goes to London for nursing school, finds a lesbian lover, and teams up with her to rob and terrorize London until her mother, boyfriend and parish priest bring Noreen back home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With sly wit, characteristic, brilliant blending of sadness and humor and macabre genius, Mondo Desperado is a wonderfully imagined work of fiction -- McCabe&#39;s most dazzling yet -- rom a truly original literary talent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
