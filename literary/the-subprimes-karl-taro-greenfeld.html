  <title>The Subprimes - Karl Taro Greenfeld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A wickedly funny dystopian parody set in a financially apocalyptic future America, from the critically acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Triburbia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a future America that feels increasingly familiar, you are your credit score. Extreme wealth inequality has created a class of have-nothings: Subprimes. Their bad credit ratings make them unemployable. Jobless and without assets, they&amp;#8217;ve walked out on mortgages, been foreclosed upon, or can no longer afford a fixed address. Fugitives who must keep moving to avoid arrest, they wander the globally warmed American wasteland searching for day labor and a place to park their battered SUVs for the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karl Taro Greenfeld&amp;#8217;s trenchant satire follows the fortunes of two families whose lives reflect this new dog-eat-dog, survival-of-the-financially-fittest America. Desperate for work and food, a Subprime family has been forced to migrate east, hoping for a better life. They are soon joined in their odyssey by a writer and his family&amp;#8212;slightly better off, yet falling fast. Eventually, they discover a small settlement of Subprimes who have begun an agrarian utopia built on a foreclosed exurb. Soon, though, the little stability they have is threatened when their land is targeted by job creators for shale oil extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all is not lost. A hero emerges, a woman on a motorcycle&amp;#8212;suspiciously lacking a credit score&amp;#8212;who just may save the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Subprimes&lt;/em&gt;, Karl Taro Greenfeld turns his keen and unflinching eye to our country today&amp;#8212;and where we may be headed. The result is a novel for the 99 percent: a darkly funny comedy about paradise lost and found, the value of credit, economic policy, and the meaning of family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
