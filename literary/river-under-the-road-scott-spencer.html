      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the bestselling, critically acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Man in the Woods&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Endless Love&lt;/em&gt;, a stunning, stinging portrait of class and creativity-and the double-edged sword of success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen parties over the course of two decades-an opium infused barbeque, a reception for a doomed presidential candidate, a fund-raiser for a blind child who speaks in tongues, a visit to one of New York&amp;#8217;s fabled sex clubs-brilliantly reveal the lives of two couples, one hoping to be admitted to the kingdom of Art, the other hoping for a small share of the American dream, both driven by forces of history they rarely perceive or acknowledge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaddeus Kaufman, the son of booksellers, and Grace Cornell, raised in a basement apartment she longs to escape, meet at a neighborhood art fair in Chicago. Soon after, they head to New York, aloft on the wings of young love.&amp;#160; Jennings Stratton, the son of a caretaker, and Muriel Sanchez, the daughter of a cop, meet in a house he is refurbishing in New Mexico, and they, too, head for the big city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a vast Hudson River estate, the lives of the two couples ultimately intertwine.&amp;#160; Thaddeus has made it big in an unexpected way, setting off a chain reaction of envy among his friends and peers and forever changing the dynamic of his marriage with Grace, for whom success has been elusive, and art, once a source of solace, has become a font of bitterness. And Jennings, hoping to transcend his reputation as the local Casanova, a man suited only for menial tasks, has ventured into a cycle of theft and betrayal that threatens to destroy the fragile life of his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funny and cutting, affecting and expansive, &lt;em&gt;River Under the Road&lt;/em&gt; is Scott Spencer&amp;#8217;s masterpiece of all that lies beneath our everyday lives-a story about the pursuit of love, art, and money, and the inevitable reckoning that awaits us all. &lt;/p&gt;" />
