      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A novel set in Yellowknife&#39;s historic Old Town in the 70s that explores both abandonment and belonging in the life of a young woman.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1977, Annie, a flighty artist, and her twelve-year-old daughter, Delilah, trade the cherry blossom trees and beaches of Vancouver for rugged and remote Old Town in Yellowknife, surprising Delilah’s father by showing up on his doorstep. As she adapts to her new surroundings, Delilah befriends Will, a local Dene man and her father’s business partner. But Annie’s capricious nature undermines Delilah’s elusive sense of belonging when Annie leaves Old Town for an artists’ colony without saying goodbye. While coping with her family’s instability and changes within herself, Delilah becomes attached to Will as she grows alienated from her increasingly aloof father. When Will vanishes in a blizzard one night, Delilah is devastated and suspects her father is to blame. What happened to Will? Is there anyone she can trust? Where—and with whom—does she belong?&lt;/p&gt;" />
