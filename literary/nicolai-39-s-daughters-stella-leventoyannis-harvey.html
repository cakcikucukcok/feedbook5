  <title>Nicolai&#39;s Daughters - Stella Leventoyannis Harvey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Compelled to fulfill her father&#39;s dying wish to find the half-sister he kept from her, Alexia arrives in her father&#39;s village of Diakofto on the edge of the Peloponnese. There she discovers a culture she knows nothing about, a country in financial crisis, and an extended family with too many secrets. The Sarinopoulos family has long been marked by tragedy, war, and a shame fanned by idle village gossip. Looming over Alexia&#39;s visit and the one trip back to Greece her father had taken twenty-five years earlier is the tragedy of Kalavryta, a Second World War massacre that changed their family forever. Told in alternating voices of Alexia and Nicolai, who each return to Greece to mourn a loss and find solace, &lt;i&gt;Nicolai&#39;s Daughters&lt;/i&gt; uncovers the secret shame that festers in a family, refusing to heal until the truth is revealed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
