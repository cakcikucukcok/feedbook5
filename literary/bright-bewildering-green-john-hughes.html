  <title>Bright Bewildering Green - John Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bright Bewildering Green is a vivid, harrowing tale - told from the emotional security of middle age - of an impoverished childhood in rural Northern Ireland during the 1950s and early &#39;60s. In its detailed evocation of the realities of life for an orphan family on an Armagh hill-farm, the sentimentality of the family pig is bled to death. William vents his frustrations on John, his sensitive youngest brother, and severe beatings lead to the boy&#39;s collapse and treatment for epilepsy until he escapes to Coventry. Inherited pluck and fortitude sustain him in a strange city, and from an achieved tranquillity the author allows himself to reflect upon the horrors, and occasional joys, endured as a child, and faces them with dispassion. This compelling narrative is the record of a survivor. &#39;A story remarkable because commonplace in rural Ireland - the surplus child, the tragedy of the extra mouth.&#39; - from the Foreword by John Stalker &#39;A heartening, eloquent but dispassionate testimony to the triumph of determination over adversity. Hughes shows himself to be a writer of unusual talent, clarity and perception.&#39; - Albert Smith, Irish Independent &#39;Powerfully written, with the vivid clarity of a naive painting.&#39; - Roy Foster, Book of the Year, The Irish Times" />
