  <title>Two-Part Inventions: A Novel - Lynne Sharon Schwartz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;Two-Part Inventions&lt;/I&gt; begins when Suzanne, a concert pianist, dies suddenly of a stroke in the New York City apartment she shares with her producer husband Philip. Rather than mourn in peace, Philip becomes deeply paranoid: their life is based on a fraud and the acclaimed music the couple created is about to be exposed.  Philip had built a career for his wife by altering her recordings, taking a portion of a song here and there, from recordings of other pianists. Syncing the alterations seamlessly, he created a piece of flawless music with Suzanne getting sole credit.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this urban, psychological novel, author Lynne Sharon Schwartz brilliantly guides the reader through a flawed marriage and calculated career. Beginning with Suzanne&amp;#8217;s death and moving backwards in time, Schwartz examines their life together, and her remarkable career, while contemplating the nature of truth, marriage and the pursuit of perfection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
