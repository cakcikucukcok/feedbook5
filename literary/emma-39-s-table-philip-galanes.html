  <title>Emma&#39;s Table - Philip Galanes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the moment Emma Sutton walks into the esteemed FitzCoopers auction house, the one-time media darling knows exactly what she wants: an exquisite antique dining table. What she doesn&#39;t realize is what she&#39;s getting: the chance to set things right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh from a year-long stretch in prison and the public bloodletting that accompanied her fall, Emma needs a clean slate. She finds her life just as she left it, filled with glittering business successes and bruising personal defeats&amp;#8212;rolling television cameras and chauffeured limousines, followed by awkward Sunday dinners at home. She knows, deep down, that she needs a change, though she can&#39;t imagine where it might come from or where it will lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Benjamin Blackman, a terminally charming social worker who moonlights for Emma on the weekends, and Gracie Santiago, an overweight little girl from Queens, one of Benjamin&#39;s most heartbreaking wards. Together with an eclectic supporting cast&amp;#8212;including Emma&#39;s prodigal ex-husband, a bossy yoga teacher, and a tiny Japanese diplomat&amp;#8212;the unlikely trio is whisked into a fleet-footed story of unforeseen circumstance and delicious opportunity, as their solitary searching for better paths leads them all, however improbably, straight to Park Avenue and the dynamic woman at the novel&#39;s center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophisticated yet accessible, lighthearted but also telling, &lt;em&gt;Emma&#39;s Table&lt;/em&gt; is a thoroughly winning and surprisingly affecting tale of second chances.&lt;/p&gt;" />
