  <title>Hannah&#39;s List (A Blossom Street Novel, Book 7) - Debbie Macomber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Perfect for fans of Maeve Binchy&#39; - &lt;em&gt;Candis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;I want you to marry again. . . .&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On the anniversary of his beloved wife’s death, Dr. Michael Everett receives a letter Hannah had written him. In it she makes one final request. An impossible request: I want you to marry again – and she’s chosen three women he should consider.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First is Winter Adams, a trained chef who owns a café on Blossom Street. The second is Leanne Lancaster, Hannah’s oncology nurse. Michael knows them both. But the third name is one he’s not familiar with – Macy Roth.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each of these three women has her own heartache, but during the months that follow, Michael spends time with Winter, Leanne and Macy, learning more about each of them… and about himself.&lt;/p&gt;
