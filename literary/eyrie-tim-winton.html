  <title>Eyrie - Tim Winton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shortlisted for the 2014 Miles Franklin Literary Award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;An exhilarating new book from Australia&#39;s most acclaimed writer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Winton is Australia&#39;s most decorated and beloved literary novelist. Short-listed twice for the Booker Prize and the winner of a record four Miles Franklin Awards for Best Australian Novel, he has a gift for language virtually unrivaled among English-language novelists. His work is both tough and tender, primordial and new--always revealing the raw, instinctual drives that lure us together and rend us apart.&lt;br&gt;     In &lt;i&gt;Eyrie&lt;/i&gt;, Winton crafts the story of Tom Keely, a man struggling to accomplish good in an utterly fallen world. Once an ambitious, altruistic environmentalist, Keely now finds himself broke, embroiled in scandal, and struggling to piece together some semblance of a life. From the heights of his urban high-rise apartment, he surveys the wreckage of his life and the world he&#39;s tumbled out of love with. Just before he descends completely into pills and sorrow, a woman from his past and her preternatural child appear, perched on the edge of disaster, desperate for help.&lt;br&gt;     When you&#39;re fighting to keep your head above water, how can you save someone else from drowning? As Keely slips into a nightmarish world of con artists, drug dealers, petty violence, and extortion, Winton confronts the cost of benevolence and creates a landscape of uncertainty. &lt;i&gt;Eyrie&lt;/i&gt; is a thrilling and vertigo-inducing morality tale, at once brutal and lyrical, from one of our finest storytellers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
