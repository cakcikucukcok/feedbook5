  <title>No One Can Pronounce My Name - Rakesh Satyal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;Goodreads&lt;/i&gt;&#39; Best Books of the Month (May 2017)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of&lt;i&gt; BuzzFeed&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s 31 Incredible New Books You Need to Read This Spring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;The Millions&lt;/i&gt;&#39; Most Anticipated Books of the Year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A HUMOROUS AND TENDER MULTIGENERATIONAL NOVEL ABOUT IMMIGRANTS AND OUTSIDERS--THOSE TRYING TO FIND THEIR PLACE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY AND WITHIN THEIR OWN FAMILIES&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a suburb outside Cleveland, a community of Indian Americans has settled into lives that straddle the divide between Eastern and Western cultures. For some, America is a bewildering and alienating place where coworkers can&#39;t pronounce your name but will eagerly repeat the Sanskrit phrases from their yoga class. Harit, a lonely Indian immigrant in his mid forties, lives with his mother who can no longer function after the death of Harit&#39;s sister, Swati. In a misguided attempt to keep both himself and his mother sane, Harit has taken to dressing up in a sari every night to pass himself off as his sister. Meanwhile, Ranjana, also an Indian immigrant in her mid forties, has just seen her only child, Prashant, off to college. Worried that her husband has begun an affair, she seeks solace by writing paranormal romances in secret. When Harit and Ranjana&#39;s paths cross, they begin a strange yet necessary friendship that brings to light their own passions and fears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rakesh Satyal&#39;s &lt;i&gt;No One Can Pronounce My Name&lt;/i&gt; is a distinctive, funny, and insightful look into the lives of people who must reconcile the strictures of their culture and traditions with their own dreams and desires.&lt;/p&gt;" />
