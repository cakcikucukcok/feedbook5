  <title>One D.O.A., One On The Way - Mary Robison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Robison&#39;s minimalism is more like a slap in the face: it&#39;s short, it stings, and you wonder who in tarnation did that to you.&quot; —&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Eve. Based in New Orleans, she&#39;s a location scout for a movie production company and complacently married to Adam. &quot;Now you know,&quot; she says. &quot;Our names really didn&#39;t bother me that much until the mail started arriving addressed to &#39;Adam and Eve Broussard.&#39;&quot; He&#39;s just been diagnosed with a grave illness and gone back to the palatial family home where his parents reside. It&#39;s all just fine with Eve—or so she tells herself at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But standing left of center in this still-prosperous but mortally wounded family does not get easier as the weeks wear on. As she negotiates her way around the anger of Adam&#39;s despised twin brother Saunders, maintains her friendship with his beautiful and volatile wife Petal, and protects what&#39;s left of the innocence of her niece Collie, Eve finds more than the Louisiana heat oppressive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
