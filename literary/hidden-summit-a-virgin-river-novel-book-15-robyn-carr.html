            &lt;em&gt;Virgin River – Now a Netflix Original series&lt;/em&gt;

          &lt;strong&gt;Virgin River – Book 15&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Finding a home in most unexpected of places&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Connor Danson becomes an unwitting witness to a violent crime, he is forced to leave Sacramento and keep a low profile until the trial is over. He arrives in the tiny mountain town of Virgin River with a chip on his shoulder and an ache in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Leslie Petruso didn’t want to leave her hometown. But she can no longer face her ex-husband tell everyone that his new wife and impending fatherhood are the best things that ever happened to him. She needs to escape and, although Virgin River may not be home, it’s a place where she can be anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Neither Connor nor Leslie is remotely interested in starting a new relationship. But even they can’t deny they have a lot in common—broken hearts notwithstanding. And in Virgin River, no one can stay hidden away from life and love for very long.…&lt;/p&gt;
