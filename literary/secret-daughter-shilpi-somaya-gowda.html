      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Somer&amp;#8217;s life is everything sheimagined it would be&amp;#8212;she&amp;#8217;s newly married and has started her career as a physician in SanFrancisco&amp;#8212;until she makes the devastating discovery she never will be able to have children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same year in India, a poor mother makes the heartbreaking choice to save her newborn daughter&amp;#8217;s life by giving her away. It is a decision that will haunt Kavita for the rest of her life, and cause a ripple effect that travels across the world and back again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asha, adopted out of a Mumbai orphanage, is the child that binds the destinies of these two women.
