          &lt;strong&gt;Billionaire’s Contract Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Billionaire businessman Evan Reese had wanted her for six months. Now Celia would accompany him to beautiful Catalina for a family wedding. There he would wine, dine and seduce the stunning ad executive…for he knew she desired him. Yet how would she react when Evan told her she’d be playing the role of his fake fiancée?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Money Man’s Fiancée Negotiation&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, Ash Williams had found his runaway mistress. Melody Trent couldn’t even remember him, but Ash was determined to discover the truth. Had he fathered her child? And the only way to bring her to his home was to claim her as his fiancée – even if she had no memory of him whatsoever!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;KINGS OF THE BOARDROOM&lt;em&gt; They need the right women to melt their steel-hard hearts!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
