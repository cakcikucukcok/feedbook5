      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wenona Black Elk is woven from three threadsDakota Sioux, Navajo, and white. Her father trades his soul to keep the secret that he has created a child with a white woman.

&lt;p&gt;As a child, a stable family life eludes Wenona. She is shuffled from her Dakota Sioux grandparents windswept farm in South Dakota to her great aunts ranch on the Navajo desert. Her unstable father drops into her life at rare moments, leaving as quickly as he arrives. But Wenona faces more challenges than trying to figure out where she belongsshe is taunted by other children and called half-blood. Her childhood is not easy, and despite all she endures, Wenona becomes a young woman with hopes and dreams. Unfortunately, she finds herself in an ill-fated marriage and soon after, her father unleashes a devastating blow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Painted against the colorful backdrop of Dakota and Navajo culture, Wenonas journey carries her from prejudice to self-acceptance, forgiveness and the eventual realization that true family is found in the hidden depths of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
