  <title>The Lost Daughter Collective - Lindsey Drager</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Using bedtime stories as cautionary tales, a Wrist Scholar relays the story of a fabled group of fathers coping with dead and missing daughters. When the girl sacrifices everything to send a final message to her father through her art and one lost girl is revealed to be not dead or missing but a daughter who has transitioned into a son, fathers are faced with the reality that their children&amp;#8217;s &amp;#147;play&amp;#8221; is anything but.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Caught in a strange loop that&amp;#151;like Escher&amp;#8217;s &amp;#147;Drawing Hands&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;confuses the line between reality and artifice, folklore and scholarship, far past and near future, &lt;I&gt;The Lost Daughter Collective&lt;/I&gt; illustrates how the stories we receive are shaped by those who do the telling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A story about the complex relationship between fathers and daughters as well as the ethics of storytelling, The Lost Daughter Collective is a gothic fairy tale fusing the fabulism at work in Donald Barthleme and Ben Marcus with the brevity and language play of Rikki Ducornet and Jenny Offill to raise questions about agency and authorship in our narratives.&lt;/div&gt;" />
