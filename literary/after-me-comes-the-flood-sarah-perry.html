Perry’s first book in some ways shows it is just that, clinging a little too closely to a creative writing course, composed of some excellent ideas, evident depth and craft, but not quite seamlessly connecting and connected.<br /><b><i>After Me Comes The Flood: Sarah Perry: 9781781253649 ...</i></b> | The intriguing premise of Sarah Perry's After Me Comes the Flood is as follows: 'What if you walked out of your life only to find another one was already waiting for you?' Heralded 'elegant, gently sinister and psychologically complex', the novel holds instant appeal for fans of books like Diane Setterfield's The Thirteenth Tale , Susan Hill's The Woman in Black , and of authors such as Sarah Waters.<br /><b><i>After Me Comes the Flood by Sarah Perry - Goodreads</i></b> | After Me Comes the Flood: A Novel [Sarah Perry] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers.
