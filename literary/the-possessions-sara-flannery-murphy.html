  <title>The Possessions - Sara Flannery Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Refinery29&lt;/em&gt; Best Book of the Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;I was totally immersed in the strange, beautiful world of Sara Flannery Murphy&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Possessions&lt;/em&gt;. A gripping, chilling read that&amp;#8217;s part love story, part mystery, and completely original, it&amp;#8217;s sensuous, scary, and utterly thrilling. I&amp;#8217;ve never read anything quite like it.&quot; &amp;#8212;Anton DiSclafani, author of &lt;em&gt;The Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;An enthralling meditation on grief and memory cloaked in suspenseful psychodrama, &lt;em&gt;The Possessions&lt;/em&gt; dissolves the boundaries of past and present and artfully, heartbreakingly maps the consequences of transgressive desire. Sara Flannery Murphy has written the best kind of ghost story.&quot; &amp;#8212;Robin Wasserman, author of &lt;em&gt;Girls on Fire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this electrifying literary debut, a young woman who channels the dead for a living crosses a dangerous line when she falls in love with one of her clients, whose wife died under mysterious circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an unnamed city, Eurydice works for the Elysian Society, a private service that allows grieving clients to reconnect with lost loved ones. She and her fellow workers, known as &quot;bodies&quot;, wear the discarded belongings of the dead and swallow pills called lotuses to summon their spirits&amp;#8212;numbing their own minds and losing themselves in the process. Edie has been a body at the Elysian Society for five years, an unusual record. Her success is the result of careful detachment: she seeks refuge in the lotuses&amp;#8217; anesthetic effects and distances herself from making personal connections with her clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Edie channels Sylvia, the dead wife of recent widower Patrick Braddock, she becomes obsessed with the glamorous couple. Despite the murky circumstances surrounding Sylvia&amp;#8217;s drowning, Edie breaks her own rules and pursues Patrick, moving deeper into his life and summoning Sylvia outside the Elysian Society&amp;#8217;s walls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of hiding beneath the lotuses&amp;#8217; dulling effect, Edie discovers that the lines between her own desires and those of Sylvia have begun to blur, and takes increasing risks to keep Patrick within her grasp. Suddenly, she finds her quiet life unraveling as she grapples not only with Sylvia&amp;#8217;s growing influence and the questions surrounding her death, but with her own long-buried secrets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tale of desire and obsession, deceit and dark secrets that defies easy categorization, &lt;em&gt;The Possessions&lt;/em&gt; is a seductive, absorbing page-turner that builds to a shattering, unforgettable conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
