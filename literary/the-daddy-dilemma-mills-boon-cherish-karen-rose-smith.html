          &lt;strong&gt;Could she have found her little boy? &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Six years ago, Sara Hobart helped a childless couple create their own miracle. Now she needed one of her own. All her instincts were telling her she was Kyle Barclay’s birth mother. Only one thing stood in the way of her answers: Kyle’s widowed father.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ever since his wife had died, Nathan had tried to be the best parent he could to five-year-old Kyle. Then this gorgeous, sensual stranger showed up. Legally, Sara had no claim on his son. But could he keep her from the little boy who already adored her? That went double for Nathan, who was suddenly yearning to go from single dad to devoted family man…&lt;/p&gt;
