  <title>The Body of the Beasts - Audrée Wilhelmy, Susan Ouriou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Reminiscent of Ga&amp;#233;tan Soucy&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches&lt;/em&gt; and William Golding&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt;, Audr&amp;#233;e Wilhelmy&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Body of the Beasts&lt;/em&gt; is a startling, gorgeously written novel that tells the story of the Boryas family, who mind a lighthouse and live in isolation until their lives are altered when young No&amp;#233; arrives in Sitjaq after fifteen years of wandering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her dresses are torn, her manners are savage. No&amp;#233; marries into the family and bears seven children that she leaves to the care of Sevastien-Benedikt, an elder and kind of giant on whose hunting and gathering the family depends. No&amp;#233; then moves into a cabin on her own and covers the walls with drawings that explain her mysterious life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extended family&amp;#8217;s curious and enthralling descent into a weirdly carnal, primal existence reaches its disturbing, singular apogee in the revelatory life of twelve-year-old Mie, one of No&amp;#233;&amp;#8217;s daughters, who is able to borrow at will the body of mammals, birds, fish, and insects. Her shape-shifting allows her to know the world, but only to a point. When her awakening body starts to intrigue her, she shamelessly asks her uncle Osip to show her &amp;#8220;how humans do sex,&amp;#8221; something she has as yet only briefly experienced through the animals whose bodies she has borrowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Body of the Beasts is a tour de force, driven by uninhibited and sensuous writing, a book that explores an aspect of the human condition too often ignored &amp;#8212; our animal nature.&lt;/p&gt;" />
