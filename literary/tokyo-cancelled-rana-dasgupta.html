  <title>Tokyo Cancelled - Rana Dasgupta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Thirteen passengers are stranded at an airport. Tokyo, their destination, is covered in snow and all flights are cancelled. To pass the night they form a huddle by the silent baggage carousels and tell one another stories. Thus begins Rana Dasgupta&#39;s Canterbury Tales for our times.&lt;br&gt;In the spirit of Borges and Calvino, Dasgupta&#39;s writing combines an energetically modern landscape with a timeless, beguiling fairy-tale ethos, while bringing to life a cast of extraordinary individuals-some lost, some confused, some happy-in a world that remains ineffable, inexplicable, and wonderful.&lt;BR&gt;A Ukrainian merchant is led by a wingless bird back to a lost lover; Robert De Niro&#39;s son masters the transubstantiation of matter and turns it against his enemies; a man who manipulates other people&#39;s memories has to confront his own past; a Japanese entrepreneur risks losing everything in his obsession with a doll; a mute Turkish girl is left alone in the house of a German man who is mapping the world.&lt;BR&gt;Told by people on a journey, these are stories about lives in transit, stories that grow into an epic cycle about the hopes and dreams and disappointments that connect people everywhere.&lt;/div&gt;" />
