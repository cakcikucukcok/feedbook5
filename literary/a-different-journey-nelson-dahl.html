  <title>A Different Journey - Nelson Dahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eric McGrann is a young man who is filled with uncertainty as he enters the adult world of college and career decisions on the cusp of the 1960s. But his twin, who had shared an almost identical life before, seems to know exactly what he wants to do in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching his brothers progress only makes Eric more undecided. He is drawn to the ever-changing kaleidoscope of the world around him as he heads from his native Minneapolis to the West Coast to seek answers to questions he has not yet formed. Stopping first in Los Angeles and later San Francisco, Eric is drawn to several unique people who share their life views with him. In Los Angeles, he learns about love. In the Bay Area, he experiences the antiwar movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his voyage of discovery, the love of a girl from his home town sustains him as Eric tries on more than one identity before he settles in Seattle. There, he finds himself and discovers his true passion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
