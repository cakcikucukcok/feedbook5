  <title>Eight White Nights - André Aciman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A LUSHLY ROMANTIC NOVEL FROM THE AUTHOR OF &lt;i&gt;CALL ME BY YOUR NAME&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eight White Nights&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable journey through that enchanted terrain where passion and fear and the sheer craving to ask for love and to show love can forever alter who we are. A man in his late twenties goes to a large Christmas party in Manhattan where a woman introduces herself with three words: &quot;I am Clara.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the following seven days, they meet every evening at the same cinema. Overwhelmed yet cautious, he treads softly and won&#39;t hazard a move. The tension between them builds gradually, marked by ambivalence, hope, and distrust. As André Aciman explores their emotions with uncompromising accuracy and sensuous prose, they move both closer together and farther apart, culminating on New Year&#39;s Eve in a final scene charged with magic and the promise of renewal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Call Me by Your Name&lt;/i&gt;, Aciman&#39;s debut novel, established him as one of the finest writers of our time, an expert at the most sultry depictions of longing and desire. As &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post Book World &lt;/i&gt;wrote, &quot;The beauty of Aciman&#39;s writing and the purity of his passions should place this extraordinary first novel within the canon of great romantic love stories for everyone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aciman&#39;s piercing and romantic new novel is a brilliant performance from a master prose stylist.&lt;/p&gt;" />
