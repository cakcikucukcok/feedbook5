  <title>The Atlas of Forgotten Places - Jenny D. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From author Jenny D. Williams, a fresh new voice in fiction, comes her stunning debut novel &lt;i&gt;The Atlas of Forgotten Places. &lt;/i&gt;Set against the backdrop of ivory smuggling and civil war in Uganda and the DR Congo, it is a story of two women from different worlds, bound in a quest to save their loved ones.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every page of &lt;i&gt;The Atlas of Forgotten Places&lt;/i&gt; resonates with an intimate knowledge of life in &#39;Africa&#39;...the impossible beauty of the landscape, the depths of sorrows carried by ordinary citizens, the miraculous melding of violence and personal grace. Jenny D. Williams has written that rare thing: a page-turning adventure story that simultaneously goes deep into the heart of what it is to be human and present.&quot; --Malla Nunn, award-winning screenwriter and author of &lt;i&gt;A Beautiful Place to Die&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Silent Valley&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Present Darkness&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a long career as an aid worker, Sabine Hardt has retreated to her native Germany for a quieter life. But when her American niece Lily disappears while volunteering in Uganda, Sabine must return to places and memories she once thought buried in order to find her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Uganda, Rose Akulu -- haunted by a troubled past with the Lord&#39;s Resistance Army and a family torn apart by war -- is distressed when her lover Ocen vanishes without a trace. Side by side, Sabine and Rose must unravel the tangled threads that tie Lily and Ocen&#39;s lives together--ultimately discovering that the truth of their loved ones&#39; disappearance is inescapably entwined to the secrets the two women carry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Atlas of Forgotten Places&lt;/i&gt; is a book that delves deep into the heart of compassion and redemption. It spans geographies and generations to lay bare the stories that connect us all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
