  <title>The Rainbow Troops - Andrea Hirata, Angie Kilbane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Published in Indonesia in 2005, &lt;i&gt;The Rainbow Troops&lt;/i&gt;, Andrea Hirata&#39;s closely autobiographical debut novel, sold more than five million copies, shattering records. Now it promises to captivate audiences around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ikal is a student at the poorest village school on the Indonesian island of Belitong, where graduating from sixth grade is considered a remarkable achievement. His school is under constant threat of closure. In fact, Ikal and his friends--a group nicknamed the Rainbow Troops--face threats from every angle: skeptical government officials, greedy corporations hardly distinguishable from the colonialism they&#39;ve replaced, deepening poverty and crumbling infrastructure, and their own low self-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the students also have hope, which comes in the form of two extraordinary teachers, and Ikal&#39;s education in and out of the classroom is an uplifting one. We root for him and his friends as they defy the island&#39;s powerful tin mine officials. We meet his first love, the unseen girl who sells chalk from behind a shop screen, whose pretty hands capture Ikal&#39;s heart. We cheer for Lintang, the class&#39;s barefoot math genius, as he bests the students of the mining corporation&#39;s school in an academic challenge. Above all, we gain an intimate acquaintance with the customs and people of the world&#39;s largest Muslim society.&lt;br&gt;This is classic storytelling in the spirit of Khaled Hosseini&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Kite Runner&lt;/i&gt;: an engrossing depiction of a milieu we have never encountered before, bursting with charm and verve.&lt;/p&gt;" />
