          &lt;strong&gt;He was the man she had once offered her innocence to. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The man who had heartlessly turned her away, claiming she was too young for him. Now Hunter Whitelaw, world-weary security agent with a body built for sin, was the man Manda Munroe would marry….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hunter claimed their marriage was only a means to lure her stalker out. But when the brooding bodyguard discovered his bride was just as passionate - and just as innocent - as ever, his hard heart was shaken to the core. For now Hunter knew with the certainty of a man aching with long-held desire that Manda was bound to be only his!&lt;/p&gt;
