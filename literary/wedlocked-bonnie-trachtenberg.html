  <title>Wedlocked - Bonnie Trachtenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On what should be the happiest day of her life, Rebecca Ross is panic stricken. Rebecca has just wed Craig Jacobs, but she realizes she put more thought into choosing her florist than she did in choosing the man shes just pledged to love for the rest of her life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Craig, Rebecca, a talented Long Island girl, dreamed of following in her grandmothers footsteps with an acting career. Unfortunately, she was cut down to size by years of disappointment, and by her first lovea Hollywood director. She returned to Long Island a lost and broken woman, and ended up in the last place she ever wanted: her old bedroom at her parents house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Rebeccas mother, an overzealous convert to Judaism, has a long held dream too: marry off her three daughters to Jewish men. So no one is more thrilled than her when Rebecca meets and marries bon vivant Craig Jacobs, the man who has won over the whole family. Too bad theyre all about to discover that underneath his charismatic shell, this Prince Charming is anything but! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Wedlocked&lt;/i&gt; is a funny, warm, and engaging story about life, love, marriage and family. This page-turner is the perfect summer read! Wendy Walker, bestselling author of Social Lives&lt;/p&gt;" />
