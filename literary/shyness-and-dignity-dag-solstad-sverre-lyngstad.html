  <title>Shyness and Dignity - Dag Solstad, Sverre Lyngstad</title>

He asked them to take out their school edition of &lt;/i&gt;The Wild Duck&lt;i&gt;. He was once more struck by their hostile attitude toward him. But it couldn&#39;t be helped, he had a task to perform and was going through with it. It was from them as a group that he sensed that massive dislike sent forth by their bodies. Individually they could be very pleasant, but together, positioned like now, at their desks, they constituted a structural enmity, directed at him and all that he stood for.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elias Rukla begins yet another day under the leaden Oslo sky. At the high school where he teaches, a novel insight into Ibsen&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Wild Duck &lt;/i&gt;grips him with a passion so intense that he barely notices the disinterest of his students.
