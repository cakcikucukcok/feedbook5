  <title>Shadow Seduction - Teddy Bart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why do decent people do shameful things? While media attention focuses on the misbehavior of the rich and famous, every day, thousands of ordinary people make choices for which they suffer humiliation, emotional pain, and loss. They can hide behind the cloak of anonymity and their stories are rarely told.
Such was the case of Jonathan Feldman, a respected sixty-nine-year-old businessman. Since childhood, Jonathan has had an ongoing relationship with what Dr. Carl Jung would call his &lt;i&gt;shadow&lt;/i&gt;everything that is repressed, undeveloped, and denied in ones self. For Jonathan, this darker alter ego is the famous actor he had aspired to become. Jonathans shadow manifests as an apparitional entity co-existing as the antagonist, snidely debating with Jonathan as he wrestles with his options, cleverly influencing him to make a series of bad choices. And if Jonathan isnt careful, his shadow could ultimately lead him into planning his final exit.
As he did with &lt;i&gt;A Particle of God,&lt;/i&gt; author Teddy Bart probes one of lifes enigmas through the journey toward self-discovery of Jonathan Feldman." />
