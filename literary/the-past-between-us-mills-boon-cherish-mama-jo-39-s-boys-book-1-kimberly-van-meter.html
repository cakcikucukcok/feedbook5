  <title>The Past Between Us (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (Mama Jo&#39;s Boys, Book 1) - Kimberly Van Meter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;FBI Agent Thomas Bristol has wanted Cassi Nolan since he was a kid.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now Cassi is wanted by the law and he&#39;s tracking the little thief down. The former prom queen was always wild, even when she was befriending poor foster child Tommy. But he never thought she could turn this bad: swindling destitute old ladies out of thousands, jilting men after stealing their cash. Cassi has changed - no doubt about it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So he can&#39;t let those guileless blue eyes trick him into letting her go. Even if she does profess her innocenceand her story is starting to make sense. He made vows to follow the law to the letter. And he won&#39;t let a word like love get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
