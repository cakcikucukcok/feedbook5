  <title>A Father&#39;s Law - Richard Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;An intense, provocative, and vital crime story that excavates paradoxical dimensions of race, class, sexism, family bonds, and social obligation while seeking the deepest meaning of the law.&quot; &amp;#8212;&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Originally published posthumously by his daughter and literary executor Julia Wright, &lt;em&gt;A Father&amp;#8217;s Law &lt;/em&gt;is the novel Richard Wright, acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Black Boy &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Native Son&lt;/em&gt;, never completed. Written during a six-week period prior to his death in Paris in 1960, it offers a fascinating glimpse into the writer&amp;#8217;s process as well as providing an important addition to Wright&amp;#8217;s body of work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rough form, Wright expands the style of a crime thriller to grapple with themes of race, class, and generational conflicts as newly appointed police chief Ruddy Turner begins to suspect his own son, Tommy, a student at the University of Chicago, of a series of murders in Brentwood Park. Under pressure to solve the killings and prove himself, Turner spirals into an obsession that forces him to confront his ambivalent relationship with a son he struggles to understand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prescient, raw, and powerful, &lt;em&gt;A Father&#39;s Law&lt;/em&gt; is the final gift from a literary giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We can be grateful for what [Wright] left behind and for what this book gives us to contemplate.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post Book World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
