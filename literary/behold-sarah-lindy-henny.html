  <title>Behold Sarah - Lindy Henny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sarah&#39;s autobiography will interest anyone who is curious about life&#39;s meaning, the value of self-discovery, and the search for some form of God. It is, in itself, a blueprint of self-analysis, and at the same time a description of Sarah&#39;s raw, rich life, and her restoration from despair to wanting to live. In reading &#39;Behold Sarah&#39; you will time travel with her through her singular, often murky, ever emerging past. She shares her story with an italicisedgod - but whose voice are we actually hearing? Perhaps Sarah&#39;s voice and God&#39;s are one and the same. Prepare to float on the flotsam-jetsam Thames, be guided through quirky parts of London, be banged up blissfully in a high security prison, fall in and out of love, and out and into sex , and, deep breath, find yourself in the painfully comfortable paradox of the therapy room. I, Lindy Henny (like Sarah in many respects!) am a psychotherapist, and an author. I love to write in different styles and genres - plays, poetry, novels, both profane and sacred. Accompanying Sarah on her journey, she and I spend time in an imaginary place which she calls The Hut, or The Willow Cabin; there we reflect and ponder on such things as old age, adoption, sex, love, writing poetry, relationships, croquet and tennis. I hope you enjoy &#39;Behold Sarah&#39;, and might be encouraged to &#39;Behold Yourself&#39; and like Sarah find understanding, meaning, and whatever it is you are seeking." />
