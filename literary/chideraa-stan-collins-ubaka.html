  <title>Chideraa - Stan-Collins Ubaka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ada tuned into a song while walking into the house. Instead of the excitement and pleasure that usually came with singing, a haze of vagueness and emptiness hung on her mind. What was that for? She just couldnt tell. Maybe seeing her son, Chideraa, would make her feel better. She had left him in the sitting room. But Chideraa was not in the sitting room when she walked in. Ada searched under the bed, and table. She looked up to the ceiling and the walls, even though she knew Chideraa could not have climbed there. When she couldnt find him, she screamed, Chideraa! But there was no response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, suspense, intrigue, conspiracy, deceit, treachery, pain, and anguish are all here in author Stan-Collins Ubakas latest book, Chideraa: Love and Bruises. Ubaka tells a story most of us can relate to. Ada was a young, innocent girl in love. This supposed beautiful feeling resulted in pain, then gain, then pain, and then The emotional roller coaster seemed never-ending.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Chideraa: Love and Bruises educates you about the many ills in our society. You will also find there is hope despite how things look at times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
