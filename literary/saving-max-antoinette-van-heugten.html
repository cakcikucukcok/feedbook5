          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Max Parkman—autistic and whip-smart, emotionally fragile and aggressive—is perfect in his mother&#39;s eyes. Until he&#39;s accused of murder.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Attorney Danielle Parkman knows her teenage son Max&#39;s behavior has been getting worse—using drugs and lashing out. But she can&#39;t accept the diagnosis she receives at a top-notch adolescent psychiatric facility that her son is deeply disturbed. Dangerous. Until she finds Max, unconscious and bloodied, beside a patient who has been brutally stabbed to death.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Trapped in a world of doubt and fear, barred from contacting Max, Danielle clings to the belief that her son is innocent. But has she, too, lost touch with reality? Is her son really a killer? With the justice system bearing down on them, Danielle steels herself to discover the truth, no matter what it is. She&#39;ll do whatever it takes to find the killer and to save her son from being destroyed by a system that&#39;s all too eager to convict him.&lt;/p&gt;
