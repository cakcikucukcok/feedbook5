  <title>Wife - Michelle Monay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life has never been a struggle for India, the hood&#39;s celebrity. For this inner city girl, escaping out of the Queens projects and settling into the suburban hills was more than easy. Accustomed to the luxuries of life, this ghetto-superstar has everything a hood-born chick could dream of, but most prominently, she&#39;s married to Queens&#39; biggest dope king: Sumpter &quot;Sump&quot; Jones. With two beautiful daughters, the good life and her childhood sweetheart all in tow, living couldn&#39;t have been better. That is, until one day when tragedy strikes and secrets emerge. Soon, India finds herself lost in the sauce, stagnant, and trapped in a world where the streets love no one. Eventually she realizes that being the wife of a kingpin isn&#39;t always sweet. The question is, will she be able to triumph out of the mean wicked streets, or fall victim to the dope game? Kidnapping, deception and death fill the pages from urban literary powerhouse Michelle Monay." />
