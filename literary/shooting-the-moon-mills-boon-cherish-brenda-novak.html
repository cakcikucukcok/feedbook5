  <title>Shooting the Moon (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Brenda Novak</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;When Harley Nelson got on his motorcycle and drove out of Portland, Oregon, ten years ago, he left behind a bad reputation–and a baby.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Audra Worthington was the reason for both. Well, the baby, anyway. The reputation he already had. It&#39;s why rich girl Audra fell for him in the first place. Now Audra&#39;s dead. His son, Brandon, is being raised by her family–good girl Lauren, the perfect daughter, and her uncompromising parents.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Harley&#39;s a self-made success down in California and he&#39;s ready to take responsibility for his son. And Harley Nelson&#39;s trouble. He&#39;s shown up at her door, saying he wants to get to know his son–ten years too late, in Lauren&#39;s opinion. Too bad he didn&#39;t stick by her sister, Audra, when he got her pregnant. (At least, that&#39;s the story Lauren&#39;s always heard.) And too bad he still looks so good in that black leather jacket…&lt;/p&gt;
