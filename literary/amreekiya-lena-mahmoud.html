  <title>Amreekiya - Lena Mahmoud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Isra Shadi, a twenty-one-year-old woman of mixed Palestinian and white descent, lives in California with her paternal  &lt;I&gt;amu&lt;/I&gt; (uncle),  &lt;I&gt;amtu&lt;/I&gt; (aunt), and cousins after the death of her mother and abandonment by her father at a young age. Ever the outcast in her amu and amtu&#39;s household, they eagerly encourage Isra to marry and leave. After rejecting a string of undesirable suitors, she marries Yusef, an old love from her past.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In  &lt;I&gt;Amreekiya,&lt;/I&gt; author Lena Mahmoud deftly juggles two storylines, alternating between Isra&#39;s youth and her current life as a married twentysomething who is torn between cultures and trying to define herself. The chapters chronicle various moments in Isra&#39;s narrative, including the volatile relationship of her parents and the trials and joys of forging a partnership with Yusef. Mahmoud also examines Isra&#39;s first visit to Palestine, the effects of sexism, how language affects identity, and what it means to have a love that overcomes unbearable pain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An exploration of womanhood from an underrepresented voice in American literature,  &lt;I&gt;Amreekiya &lt;/I&gt;is simultaneously unique and relatable. Featuring an authentic array of characters, Mahmoud&#39;s first novel is a much-needed story in a divided world.&lt;/P&gt;" />
