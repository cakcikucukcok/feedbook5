  <title>The Cantora - Paul D Cohn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It all began with a rumor: an Indian girl who sang with the voice of an angel. A tiny girl, perhaps only nine years old. No one believed it at first, but the rumor persisted. Finally one day a runner arrived bringing news&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;And so the journey of the woman and the girl&amp;mdash;Sister M&amp;atilde;e da Do&amp;ccedil;ura and Yema, the Caet&amp;eacute; Indian child acclaimed as The Cantora&amp;mdash;begins to unfold as perilous circumstance compels them to become agents of fate, changing the destinies of all who cross their path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setting for &lt;em&gt;The Cantora&lt;/em&gt; is coastal Brazil during the early 1500s, in the colonial town of Lu&amp;iacute;s, a shipping port for the brutal and lucrative dyewood trade. Many Indians and Africans are enslaved at the port, and the Indians, afflicted with European diseases, are perishing by the hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village priest discovers an Indian child who can sing the Latin Mass with the voice of an angel. The regional bishop assigns the girl to Sister Do&amp;ccedil;ura with the intention of making the child singer a ward of the Church. The girl is also treasured by her tribe as a mystical &lt;em&gt;Tuguy Ku&amp;ntilde;&amp;atilde;&lt;/em&gt; (Blood Woman).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bishop summons The Vatican&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Consilium de Virtutibus&lt;/em&gt; (The Council of Miracles) to certify Yema as a The First True Miracle of The New World, but when an Indian rebellion breaks out, the Council accuses the nun and child of heresy and condemns them to death. Do&amp;ccedil;ura and Yema are forced to flee for their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
