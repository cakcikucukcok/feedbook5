  <title>When the Moon Shines by Day - Sahgal Nayantara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;India has changed. Rehana finds her father&amp;rsquo;s books on medieval history have been &amp;lsquo;disappeared&amp;rsquo; from bookstores and libraries. Her young domestic help, Abdul, discovers it is safer to be called Morari Lal in the street, but there is no such pro&amp;not;tection from vigilante fury for his Dalit friend, Suraj. Kamlesh, a diplomat and writer, comes up against official wrath for his anti-war views. A bomb goes off at Cyrus Batliwala&amp;rsquo;s gallery on the opening day of an art show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presiding over this new world is the Director of Cultural Transformation, whose smiling affability masks a relentless agenda to create a Hindu master race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this atmosphere, Rehana and her three book-club friends, Nandini, Aruna and Lily, meet every week to discuss a book one of them has chosen&amp;mdash;their oasis of peace amidst the harshness of reality&amp;mdash;even as Rehana&amp;rsquo;s German friend, Franz Rohner, haunted by his country&amp;rsquo;s Nazi past, warns her of what is to come. All revolutions, he wryly observes, follow the same path. But is India about to prove him wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this brilliant, dystopian satire, Nayantara Sahgal draws a telling portrait of our times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
