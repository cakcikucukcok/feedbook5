          &lt;strong&gt;The secret of the &quot;Homecoming Baby&quot; is about to be revealed!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Patrick Torrance is shocked to discover he&#39;s adopted. But that&#39;s nothing compared to what he feels when he finds out the details of his birth. He&#39;s Enchantment&#39;s so-called Homecoming Baby–born and abandoned in the girls&#39; room during a high school dance. All the folks in town think they know who his parents are, but he&#39;s determined to find out the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But uncovering the truth is going to mean using some of Enchantment&#39;s finest residents. And once he gets to know some of them, especially Celia Brice, he begins to wonder just how much it&#39;s going to cost him to get the answers he wants.&lt;/p&gt;
