  <title>Endgame - Ahmet Altan, Alexander Dawe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Named one of &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo;s 50 Notable Books of 2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite widespread political censorship and crackdowns by the&amp;#160;Erdo&amp;#287;an&amp;#160;regime, Ahmet Altan bravely crafts a novel about the ways in which corruption envelops contemporary Turkish life. &lt;i&gt;Endgame&lt;/i&gt; is an atmospheric and enigmatic literary noir, in which an unnamed writer visits a small town and finds himself involved in a mystery with existentialist implications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A womanizing writer who has lived his entire life in the city retires to a sunbaked Turkish village. Instead of the quiet life he hoped for, he encounters a world of suspicion, paranoia, and violence. The town&#39;s mayor is both his only real ally and his greatest nemesis; his lover shares an ambiguous past with the mayor; the town seems hell-bent on turning him into a murderer; and, he is initiated into the town&#39;s biggest secret only to discover this knowledge will become a weapon used against him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The protagonist of this bestselling existential page-turner is an appealingly untrustworthy narrator whose story transports the reader into a world of lust, ambition, small-town politics, and death. A detective story turned on its head, &lt;i&gt;Endgame&lt;/i&gt; is compellingly infused with a dreamlike logic reminiscent of Paul Auster and Graham Greene." />
