  <title>Shallow Enough to Walk Through - Marissa Reaume</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Three weeks it&#39;s been raining, but no puddles...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Sara Pierce is slowly drowning in Windsor, a city where water will seemingly not stay put long enough to form puddles. While living with her germophobic best friend Angie and dealing with her online gaming-addicted boyfriend Dan, Sara finds herself obsessively writing and rewriting her own story in order to gain some sense of control over her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading like John Barth by way of Lena Dunham, &lt;i&gt;Shallow Enough to Walk Through&lt;/i&gt; is a portrait of the artist as a young woman trapped in a world she never imagined would end up this way. Marissa Reaume&#39;s playful debut is a novel that makes and unmakes itself at the same time, as strikethroughs and compulsive editorial injections take us into the mind of a young writer struggling to finally come into her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Shallow Enough to Walk Through&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;This was a strong debut from Marissa Reaume, perfect for readers who are looking for reads on the cusp between young adult and adult fiction, and I&#39;m very interested to see what she comes up with in the future.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ &lt;i&gt;Reading in Winter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;This debut novel clearly documents author Marissa Reaume&#39;s genuine talent for deftly crafted characters and nicely woven plots.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ &lt;i&gt;Midwest Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
