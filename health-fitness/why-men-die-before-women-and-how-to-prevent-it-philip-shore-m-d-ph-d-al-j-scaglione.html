      <meta name="description" content="Why Men Die Before Women and How to Prevent it contains all the exercises and principles that Al J. Scaglione used in his acting class for 25 years. Principals that today are being discovered such as &quot;The Secret&quot;, Laughter Therapy, Fear Control, etc. Women live longer than men and Al J Scaglione shows men in simple exercises how to extend their lives, living fully and productive in their family and business life.
Dr. Phillip Shore, a Research Cardioligist and a Diabetes expert validates the principles of these eexercises and why they should be adopted and used on a daily basis. He tells the story of how he met Mr. Scaglione. His wife(a cancer survivor) worked in an Al J Scaglione workshop and Dr. Shore stated that the help he gave her in time of crisis was a major factor in beating this disease.
