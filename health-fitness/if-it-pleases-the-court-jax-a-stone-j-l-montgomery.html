  <title>If It Pleases the Court - Jax A. Stone, J.L. Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The sole intent behind the creation of this book is to tell a story of a subject line exposing legal corruption and domestic violence. Most people do realize that there is always a little corruption in any form of government, but after becoming aware of the real-life events this book portrays, this story had to be told. As you start to follow this story through the pages, I think you will be blown away and, frankly, astonished at just how far corruption can grow if not held in check. As the author, I was so taken by the story as told by J.L. Montgomery that I knew it would have to be me who would bring this story to light.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If it is your desire to have a book grab your attention upfront and carry you on an epic journey of one incident building on another, this book will do it for you. Powerful and realistic story line packed with deceit, corruption, and betrayal. Even for those of you who thought you had seen or witnessed everything, this book will be a wakeup call that will show you just how far a person or organization is willing to push the lines of morality and justice to have their way.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is a story of a young lady starting out life with a bright future that quickly turned to a nightmare that she could not escape. She learned the hard way that justice can be purchased by the very people who were trying to inflict harm and destruction on her way of life. In reading my book, I hope you will agree with me that this act of judicial corruption and failure to enforce laws truly needed an avenue to be expressed and brought to the publics attention.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the read. &lt;/p&gt;
