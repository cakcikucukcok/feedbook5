  <title>Relationship Agreement - Herman Franck, Sabrina Chen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Relationship Agreement&lt;/I&gt;: Avoid Breakup. 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Relationship Agreement&lt;/I&gt; sets forth acceptable and unacceptable conduct for people in romantic relationships. Sometimes spelling out agreements can avoid breakups.
&lt;p&gt;
Couples can choose from the series of agreements by initialing each chosen page. Below each agreement is a space to handwrite proposed consequences in the event of a violation. The booklet includes an appendix with proposed consequences, and encourages couples to come up with their own ideas of what happens in the event of a breach. 
&lt;p&gt;
The appendix also sets forth dispute resolution forms. The author has established a web court (relationshipagreement.com) available to willing couples that wish to submit a dispute (at no charge) to the judgment of the Relationship Agreement Court. (The names can be changed to protect the guilty).
&lt;p&gt;
This is not a book about community property, spousal support or other matters commonly set out in pre nuptial agreements. This is a book about how two people in a relationship will conduct themselves toward each other, with the overall goal of avoiding breakup and maintaining the relationship." />
