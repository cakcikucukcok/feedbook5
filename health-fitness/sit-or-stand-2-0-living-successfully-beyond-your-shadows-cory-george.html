  <title>Sit or Stand 2.0: Living Successfully Beyond Your Shadows - Cory George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neither childhood sexual assault, a seemingly debilitating speech impediment, bullying, or bearing witness to drug and alcohol addiction within his family resulted in total defeat for the author of this gripping and frankly transparent literary offering that combines the power of testimony with carefully crafted lessons. Author, speaker, and coach practitioner, Cory George, raises the stakes for the reader to make the life-changing decision to reconcile their past hurts and to recognize and accept the valuable life lessons that will ultimately lead to better life choices. If you are tired of SITTING and continually accepting consequences related to past decisions and stuck in a continuous loop of pain, negative consequences based on bad choices, and wondering how to make sense of it all then Sit or Stand 2.0 offers, from a coach&amp;rsquo;s perspective, a playbook of tried-and-true techniques that will assist you in four critical areas of situation resolution: Acceptance, Forgiveness, Reconciliation, and Retention and Application of Wisdom.&amp;nbsp; In addition, you will come to further understand how pain, adversity, and trials can be transformed into PURPOSE and PASSION.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This highly-relatable and highly-palatable &amp;ldquo;problem resolution guide&amp;rdquo; helps to build confidence and effective communication skills by stressing the importance of understanding who you are before you are able to translate your desires to others. In addition, lessons in understanding and creating realistic expectations and understanding the importance of a healthy support system allows the reader the opportunity to fortify themselves from the outside. Finally, George empowers the reader by making clear that we all have the ability to positively affect the life of someone else. You are taught how to give positive value to every adversity that you will overcome. Your current and future relationships will become more meaningful and intentional. Your dreams will be transformed into realistic and attainable goals, and you will be able to balance confidence and courage with humility and grace as you are urged to pay it forward. You are challenged to find the courage to not only break the chains of a hostile past but to also walk into a life whereby more positive chances are taken and, in return, share the lessons of faith, reconciliation, and excellence with someone else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
