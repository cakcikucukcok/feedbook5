  <title>The 7 Systems Plan - Pat Luse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you could lose weight, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;heal chronic illness, and reverse aging for good?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks to the 7 Systems Plan, you can!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most diets have one major flaw. They focus on restricting calories without addressing the cause of your weight and health problems: a malfunction in one or more of your body&amp;rsquo;s 7 Systems. These diets give disappointing results that are often short-lived, leaving you frustrated and unfulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be this way. In this book, our strategy is threefold. We&amp;rsquo;ll evaluate your Systems, identify the imbalances or malfunctions, and then optimize your Systems. Long-term health is a result of getting all your 7 Systems working together correctly. When this happens, you can experience these incredible benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lose weight fast and maintain your ideal body weight permanently&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live up to 24 years longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have up to 87% more strength in just 8 weeks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase your energy up to 600%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decrease cancer risk up to 67%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drastically reduce your risk for all 4 of the top killers in America&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look and feel up to 10 years younger in 90 days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decrease or eliminate your need for medications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly improve your sex drive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his career, Dr. Pat Luse has helped countless patients create amazing results by following the 7 Systems Plan. You&amp;rsquo;ll meet just a few of these patients. More importantly, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover a proven process for creating the life you&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted. It&amp;rsquo;s time to get your body working for you, not against you.&lt;/p&gt;
