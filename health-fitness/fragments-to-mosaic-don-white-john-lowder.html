  <title>Fragments to Mosaic - Don White, John Lowder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Fragments to Mosaic&quot; is a book for everyone interested in education  especially math education.  The principles described and explained are transferable to other subjects.  Many people suffer from fragmented understanding.  They often fail to clearly see the big picture.  Here, students, teachers, parents, and school administrators can find hope, encouragement and direction.  Many thought provoking cartoon illustrations make the message more appealing and understandable than the average book on pedagogy.  The book provides the Why, What, and How of a method of teaching that begins with student perceptions, emphasizes conceptual connections, and develops holistic understanding while fostering critical thinking and problem solving skills.  Care has been given to point out key differences between this method and more common methods of teaching. Readers will discover how more can be learned better in less time when teachers study, learn, and practice this &quot;art.&quot;" />
