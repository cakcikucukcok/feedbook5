  <title>Best Friends, Occasional Enemies - Lisa Scottoline, Francesca Serritella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the New York Times bestselling writing team comes a hilarious new collection of essays that observe life from a mother/daughter perspective&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;New York Times bestselling author Lisa Scottoline and her daughter Francesca Serritella are the best of friends--99.9% of the time. They&#39;re number one on each other&#39;s speed dial and they tell each other everything--well, almost everything. They share shoes and clothes--except one very special green jacket, which almost caused a catfight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, they&#39;re just like every mother and daughter in the world. Best friends, and occasional enemies. Now they&#39;re dishing about it all--their lives, their relationship, and their carb count. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by their weekly column, &quot;Chick Wit&quot; for The Philadelphia Inquirer, this book is one you&#39;ll have to put down--just to stop laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lisa on Being a Mom&lt;/b&gt; - Motherhood has no expiration date. Francesca lives in the city, and I worry about her all the time. My daughter moved out, so why am I still lactating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Francesca on Being a Daughter &lt;/b&gt;- My mother is always right. Just ask her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lisa on Things Every Daughter Should Know&lt;/b&gt; - Your mother is always thinking about you, but that&#39;s not creepy. Your mother will never forget who did you dirty in the sixth grade, for which you can thank her. And your mother will never stop asking you if you need to go to the bathroom, before you leave the house. Well, do you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Francesca on Closet Wars&lt;/b&gt; - My mom is a great dresser. Mostly because she&#39;s wearing my clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lisa on Aging Gracefully&lt;/b&gt; - My sex drive is in reverse, I have more whiskers than my cat, and my estrogen replacement is tequila.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Francesca on Apartment Living&lt;/b&gt; - When I saw a mouse, the first person I called was Mom. She told me to call my super, but I felt bad bothering him. I hate to bother people. But I love to bother my mother.&lt;/p&gt;" />
