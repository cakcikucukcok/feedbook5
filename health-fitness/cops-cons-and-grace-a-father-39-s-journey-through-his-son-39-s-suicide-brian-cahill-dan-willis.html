  <title>Cops, Cons, and Grace: A Father&#39;s Journey Through His Son&#39;s Suicide - Brian Cahill, Dan Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A decade ago Brian Cahill became the victim of the greatest tragedy any parent can endure with the loss of his firstborn son, a veteran police officer in the aftermath of a painful divorce, to suicide. Far from the carefree retirement he had envisioned, the devastated father faced a journey back from the brink of utter despair. As the author of numerous opinion pieces and essays on religion, the lifelong Catholic was familiar with the concept that the cross is followed by the resurrection, and that from death comes new life. In the devastating years following his beloved son&#39;s suicide, the abstract became very real. Cahill&#39;s work volunteering with two different groups--cops and cons--saved him, allowing him to eventually experience a measure of grace. The unlikely combination of working with SFPD officers on suicide prevention and leading a spirituality group for San Quentin lifers brought him enough of a sense of peace and acceptance to truly want to continue living." />
