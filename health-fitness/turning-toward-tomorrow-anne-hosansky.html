  <title>Turning Toward Tomorrow - Anne Hosansky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In these true-life stories, men and women who lost a spouse or domestic partner (including gay relationships), reveal how they put their lives back together in positive and often dramatic ways.  They share candid revelations about how they dealt with issues ranging from learning to live alone, coping with guilt and anger, and the balancing act of single parent, to venturing into the dating scene and the complexities of new love, including sex with a different partner - along with advice from psychologists and bereavement counselors. Written like a novel, this is a portable support group for anyone determined to triumph over loss. 
Hosansky is a strong authoritative voice because shes been through  loss herself.... Her book Widows Walk is destined to be a classic in the literature of grief.
