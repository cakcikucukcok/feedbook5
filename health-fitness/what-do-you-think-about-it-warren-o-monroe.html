  <title>What Do You Think About It? - Warren O. Monroe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Collection of Daily Thoughts&lt;p&gt;
The word thought generally refers to any mental or intellectual activity
involving an individual&#39;s subjective consciousness. It can refer either to
the act of thinking or the resulting ideas or arrangement of ideas. Over
the past few years I&#39;ve put my thoughts down on paper and shared them
with family and friends. Some said to me &quot;its too long&quot;, some said to me
&quot;Ive heard that before&quot; and some just said nothing as if my thoughts were
delivered and fallen into a black hole. On the other hand there were those
who cheered me on and encouraged me to keep distributing my thoughts
and consider some day writing a book. &quot;What Do You Think About It&quot; is
a labor of love collection of my best 31weekly thoughts for your reading
enjoyment. In addition, you can take an active part in my literary endeavor
by writing down your thoughts at the end of each chapter. One difference
between humans and other animals is our ability to think, process our
thoughts and make life changing decisions on the results. As you read and
hopefully enjoy my book apply your thoughts to the message intended
in each chapter. It&#39;s not really our efforts that define us; it&#39;s our ability to
open our minds and hearts to the depths of our true thoughts and honest
feelings. Paracelsus, renaissance period physician, chemist, and surgeon
wrote; thoughts are free and subject to no rule. On them rest the freedom
of a man and they tower above the light of nature . . . create a new heaven,
a new firmament, a new source of energy from which new art flows.&lt;p&gt;
This book represents a small piece of my heaven, my new firmament, my
new source of energy from which my new art will flow. I hope you enjoy all
my thoughts but I don&#39;t expect you will just sail away on a literary cruise
navigated by everything I&#39;ve written. So I&#39;ve provided space at the end of
each chapter for your thoughts on each topic. Hence the title, &quot;What Do
You Think About It&quot; ...Bon Voyage&lt;p&gt;" />
