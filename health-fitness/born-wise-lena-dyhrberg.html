  <title>Born Wise - Lena Dyhrberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For generations it has been the common perception that children are inarticulate little creatures who, like empty shells, must be filled with knowledge and experiences. However, according to family health nurse Lena Dyhrberg, this is not at all the case. Your child arrives in this world with a highly developed intuition and knowledge, and your child understands everything you say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book she gives numerous examples of how she, by talking with children, has helped families eradicate everything from colic to chronic colds in addition to helping them through difficult life crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born Wise also tackles todays tendency to turn children into projects and parenting into a science. Lena Dyhrberg takes us by the hand and lovingly shows us how simply it can be done.&lt;br /&gt;Mette Moellevang, journalist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an absolutely brilliant book. The author, Lena Dyhrberg, has the eyes of a psychologist, anthropologist, nurse, and experienced mother.&lt;br /&gt;Hikaru Suzuki, mother of twin boys &lt;br /&gt;PhD, Harvard University, MBA, University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines in this book helped to create our healthy, happy, and fantastic family.&lt;br /&gt;Carl Johan Collins; MBA, INSEAD &amp; &lt;br /&gt;Helle Collins; LLM, University of London&lt;br /&gt;Parents of two children&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading this book I now see my son in a wholly new lightas an independent human being who possesses far greater mental awareness.&lt;br /&gt;Mille Kirk, mother of one son&lt;/p&gt;" />
