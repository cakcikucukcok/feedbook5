  <title>Finding Hope - Aura Polanco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finding Hope is the story of a young woman, Kate Connor, who survives a tragedy that resulted in an immense loss. These events force her to question her existence and threaten her ability to move ahead. In a desperate attempt to run from the pain, Kate flees the only home she has ever known for a remote locale in Asia. It is in the lush surroundings and warm waters of a beach in Okinawa that she slowly restores her body and a fragment of her spirit.
Despite the distance Kate has created from her painful past, a surprising exchange begins with the man who was the cause of her anguish through letters, forcing her to question her capacity for forgiveness. Will Kate have the strength of character to forgive and allow her life to open up to new possibilities and love or will she forever be trapped in a void of guilt and fear?
Finding Hope challenges the reader to question if they too can find forgiveness under similar circumstances." />
