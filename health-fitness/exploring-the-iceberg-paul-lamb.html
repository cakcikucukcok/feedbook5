  <title>Exploring the Iceberg - Paul Lamb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When I came out of my coma at mid-life like a six year old, I had no self-esteem, no confidence, no worth or value.  I was lower than a snakes belly. Using the Iceberg Strategies my self-esteem began to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing yourself deeply is the bedrock of self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has the same core strength deep within. Self-esteem is on a continuum. Your self-esteem falls on that continuum different than anyone else. More precisely, you have enabled your self-esteem to fall there.  You are not given high or low self-esteem. Everyone has equal shares. And like everyone else, your self-esteem is bursting to come forth  overflowing its brim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are taught to respect your parents and elders.  This is confused culturally and religiously.  The confusion comes that respecting parents and elders is synonymous with them always being right or knowing better.  Compounding this repression is, you learn what you live.  Growing up with repression you tend to carry your learning with you, internalize it, and it culminates in oppressing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You live life feeling you have no value.  In reality, you have great value, as everyone does.  You just may not know it, yet. Fortunately, emerging your self-esteem and your personal growth can start at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of &lt;i&gt;Exploring the Iceberg&lt;/i&gt; you are discovering the truth.  The deeper you know yourself the more truth you discover to emerge your self-esteem to launch your undeniable freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the truth set you free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing yourself deeply is the bedrock of self-esteem.  The more self-esteem you uncover and use in your life, the more confidence you garner to be the real you!  When you have this, your self-value and self-worth increase for you to have the strength, courage and wisdom to view the world and yourself though truthful eyes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
