  <title>God Made Easy - Jag Gill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why You Shouldnt Choose This Book
It is not that peace is not. It is not that peace is rare.
Heaven is precious, yes. However, it is not rare. In fact heaven, happiness,
peace, joy is so common. It is so easily available to us.
For aeons we have had the knowledge of our truth. Knowledge of our
heaven. But we choose not to be in heaven. We choose hell. There is a
very good reason for that.
Hell is ours. Heaven belongs to God. Hell belongs to us. In heaven, God
rules; in hell, we do.
So hell is dear to us  it gives us our separation, our ego, our I am. An I am
separate from reality, from nature.
Hell gives us our responsibilities, our worries, our judgements, our
control. So we choose to stay in hell and be responsible for our problems.
In heaven, God is responsible for all problems, for all judgements.
That we cannot allow. We love our judgements.
So unless you are really tired of your hell, of your responsibilities, and of
your ego, and if it is not hurting you yet  do not buy this book.
You, like humanity has done for aeons, will choose to ignore its truth. If
ego is still giving you pleasure, stay  there is nothing wrong with hell. It
is just another reality, and it has its charms.
For those who seek change  please read on." />
