  <title>Crooked - Cathryn Jakobson Ramin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Carved in Sand&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;a veteran investigative journalist who endured persistent back pain for decades&amp;#8212;delivers the definitive book on the subject: an essential examination of all facets of the back pain industry, exploring what works, what doesn&#39;t, what may cause harm, and how to get on the road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her effort to manage her chronic back pain, investigative reporter Cathryn Jakobson Ramin spent years and a small fortune on a panoply of treatments. But her discomfort only intensified, leaving her feeling frustrated and perplexed. As she searched for better solutions, she exposed a much bigger problem. Costing roughly $100 billion a year, spine medicine&amp;#8212;often ineffective and sometimes harmful &amp;#8212;exemplified the worst aspects of the U.S. health care system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result of six years of intensive investigation, &lt;em&gt;Crooked&lt;/em&gt; offers a startling look at the poorly identified risks of spine medicine, and provides practical advice and solutions. Ramin interviewed scores of spine surgeons, pain management doctors, physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians, exercise physiologists, physical therapists, chiropractors, specialized bodywork practitioners. She met with many patients whose pain and desperation led them to make life-altering decisions, and with others who triumphed over their limitations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a brilliant and comprehensive book that is not only important but essential to millions of back pain sufferers, and all types of health care professionals. Ramin shatters assumptions about surgery, chiropractic methods, physical therapy, spinal injections and painkillers, and addresses evidence-based rehabilitation options&amp;#8212;showing, in detail, how to avoid therapeutic dead ends, while saving money, time, and considerable anguish. With &lt;em&gt;Crooked,&lt;/em&gt; she reveals what it takes to outwit the back pain industry and get on the road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;" />
