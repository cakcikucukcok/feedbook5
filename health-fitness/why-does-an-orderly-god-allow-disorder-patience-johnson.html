  <title>Why Does an Orderly God Allow Disorder - Patience Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I wrote this book in my darkest time and realized that I must use my experiences to teach people many ways to enjoy both sides of life. I believe that there is no such thing as a good time or bad time in life. Rather, I see opportunities for creative invention, regeneration, growth, circumcision of heart, and thinking about the past and the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this book to answer some of the worlds most commonly asked questions, which always cross my mind. I propose many sources of the problems we have in the world, as well as solutions for how to handle them. Do the politicians really have the solution to our economic problems? Can the world ever experience peace and harmony? Has religion done us more harm than good? Is there really a God? If there is one, where can we find him/her? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that, after reading this book, most of your questions will be answered. Human beings forget that there are two sides to everything: the good and the bad, the sun and the moon, night and day, light and darkness. Unfortunately, we choose to see only the good sides of existence as being beneficial and refuse to embrace and see the opportunities that can come from the hard times. We may be so busy seeing the faults of other people and not our own; could that be one of the reasons we seem to misunderstand each other? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to impart my wisdom to you. Do not worry about death, but consider how to be prepared when it comes. Additionally, you must acknowledge God and his sovereignty, and not only by attending church or Mosque. This book also teaches about parenting, attitudes, character and many other things about life. &lt;/p&gt;" />
