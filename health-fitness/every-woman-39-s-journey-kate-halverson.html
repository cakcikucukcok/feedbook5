      <meta name="description" content="EveryWoman&#39;s Journey is a candid female focused remake of the archaic Everyman. Through a series of thirty tell it like it is prose poems (Guilt - Joy- Forgiveness - Patience), Halverson challenges every woman to prepare for their own &quot;curtain call&quot; by asking the toughest question of all - How will YOU be remembered after death? &quot;Long before our departure date arrives, each of us needs to get our act together and look dethe in the eye,&quot; Halverson shares. Whether you use EveryWoman&#39;s Journey as a morning pick me up, evening prayer or a jump start to journaling, you will find yourself among friends, knowing you are not alone in your darkest of days. &quot;My favorites are about Humor - being able to laugh at life&#39;s everyday absurdities and Passion - meeting each morning with both enthusiasm and desire. This is the perfect &#39;chapter a day&#39; book, to be read again and again.&quot; -Judith Guest, writer/author of Ordinary People" />
