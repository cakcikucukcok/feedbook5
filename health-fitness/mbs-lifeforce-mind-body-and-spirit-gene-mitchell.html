  <title>Mbs Lifeforce – Mind, Body, and Spirit - Gene Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MBS Lifeforce  Mind, Body, and Spirit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a whole person program designed to help you achieve the highest levels of vital energy, functional strength, and optimal health. By amplifying five energy components (Identity, Mind-Body, Nutrition, Muscular, and the Heart), you become dynamically balanced and capable of accelerating your life! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no greater feeling than confidently pursuing your lifes purpose with an expanded self-awareness that youre not only connected to an unlimited Source of energy  but that its already &lt;a name=&quot;_GoBack&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in you, just waiting for you amplify it, and yes, to accelerate it! This expanded awareness may enter your consciousness as a sudden burst  an energized vision of who you truly are. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call this sudden burst a defining moment. As the MBS Lifeforce guidebooks will show you, by using the power of your imagination and your deepest desires as your internal GPS, you can tap into your own defining moment, one so powerful that it will become the game-changer of your life as all your choices and behaviors begin flowing from this expanded self-awareness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By amplifying your energy components and aligning them with your expanded awareness, you are able to accelerate your life as everything gets easier; you face challenges with an increased self-confidence and you begin to pass through resistance with grace and ease. As you embrace the loving principles of discipline and consistency, youll inspire an uncommon belief in yourself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your life is no accident. As these guidebooks will help you discover, you have a higher calling, a divine mission that is no less important than biblical Davids face off with Goliath. Your calling, like Davids, requires all the energy, strength, and health that is your potential. Following this program will amplify your lifeforce. Living this program will accelerate your life! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;Wishing you energy, strength, and health!&lt;br /&gt;  Gene Mitchell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
