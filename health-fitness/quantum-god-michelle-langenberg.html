  <title>Quantum God - Michelle Langenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If Quantum God were a Who, God would not be the judgmental, biased, and sometimes malicious Old Man in the Sky many of us grew up with, but rather the All where everything is possible and pulsating 
with potential.
If Quantum God were a What, God might be the fabric that connects every idea, every desire, every personality, and everything in a pulsating, energetic, ever-Becoming  Whole.
If Quantum God were a Where, God could be the Higgs-Boson God Particle upon which angels dance or an everywhere with ever-burgeoning dimensions well beyond our comprehension of the universe as we know it. 
If Quantum God were a Why, God would exist because creativity cannot be contained or restrained, but seeks free-flowing expression, expanding in waves and ripples of idea-become-event.
Yet Quantum God may be most like a Howthe how behind everything we know and laws we can only guess at, the how that lays the groundwork for miracles as commonplace occurrences and composes a theme from the frequency (or vibration) 
of joy.
Quantum God: How Life Really Works sheds light on the misconceptions that limit us and offers insights that can free us to be the true powers we really are, seemingly magical beings who create with godlike abilities.
When we understand the invisible workings of the universe, we stop being victims of creative laws we dont understand. These laws rule our lives, whether we comprehend them or not. What could we do if we understood them? 
Is there anything we could not do?
Miracles are the way life is meant to work.
Quantum God tells about
how we shortchange ourselves, 
our true creative potential, 
how our hopes and dreams, fears and feelings of inadequacy create our experiences, 
how to rise out of depression, victimhood, and blame to find joy and peace,
how to believe in ourselves and live with confidence and optimism.
You are now what you think you are  but youre actually so much more! You can become whatever you believe is possible. Learn how to redefine yourself." />
