  <title>Voices of Children of Divorce - Dr. David Royko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Among the scores of books concerning divorce, rarely have the voices of the innocent victims--the children--been heard.  In Dr. Royko&#39;s deeply moving assemblage of the kids&#39; sometimes troubled yet revealing thoughts, we hear them at last&quot;  --STUDS TERKEL, author of &lt;i&gt;Working&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The silent sounds of family breakups are captured with startling clarity by Dr. David Royko, who helps us to hear the observations and intimate revelations of those who have the least control of the process and who are most affected by it.  By giving voice to these silent witnesses, Dr. Royko confirms for us working in the field--lawyers, judges, mediators, social workers, and therapists--the devastating impact of divorce on those least able to cope, and the need for divorcing parents to develop an awareness of the child&#39;s perspective.&quot;  --BENJAMIN S. MACKOFF, former presiding judge of the Cook County Domestic Relations Court and director of family mediation services, Schiller, DuCanto and Fleck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dr. David Royko&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Voices of Children of Divorce &lt;/i&gt;provides sage observations from the children who have been the witness of adult folly.  The book is truly wonderful in that it allows children with vastly different experiences to share their perspectives with clarity and focus, in the process teaching adults how to better manage divorce.&quot;  --BENNETT L. LEVENTHAL, M.D., Irving B. Harris Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Chicago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At last we hear from that silent majority, the children, who are always the victims in divorce.  Dr. David Royko&#39;s collection of their candid observations should move divorcing parents to reevaluate their priorities and their behavior.&quot;  --JENNY GARDEN, author of &lt;i&gt;The (Almost) Painless Divorce: What Your Lawyer Won&#39;t Tell You&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
