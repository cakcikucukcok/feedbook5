  <title>How to Vacation &amp; Travel Safely - Earnest Hart Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How to Vacation and Travel Safely..and Come Back Alive begins with the real life story of how author Earnest Hart, Jr. was held captive in Thailand while visiting for a series of kickboxing matches. Hart felt vulnerable in this foreign land where the government was run by a military that imposed their will upon the foreign contestants with Uzis and intimidation.
     Forced to realize that the world we live in is as dangerous outside of the ring as it is inside, Hart continued his martial arts training and added to his knowledge by studying all available material related to security. 
     I didnt get a bit of sleep that night. I sat up in my bed with my back to the wall, looking at the door and hoping no one would come through it. I started to wonder if I was ever going to get back to the U. S. alive. No one outside of Thailand really knew where I was. The most important questions I went over many times during that night were, How could I have prevented this from happening, and how do I get out of this situation?
      Since 9/11, personal safety has never been more paramount. Harts book is an in-depth look at the realities of traveling in the new millennium and managing to stay safe in spite of the many obstacles that may arise. 
     Focusing on important principles for individuals and families to help prepare themselves for real life encounters, the author lays out a detailed yet easy to understand plan for the readers to follow and make a part of their traveling and everyday routines. 
     Earnest Hart, Jr. is a world-class martial arts champion, physical fitness trainer, actor and seminar specialist. He regularly presents workshops and lectures, captivating his audiences with details of his life experiences and providing them with straight talk about their personal safety.
