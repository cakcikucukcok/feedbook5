  <title>Best secret before marriage - Pharable</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;nbsp;You can get along very well with your partner&amp;#39;s family now, but if you get married, you can go from hell to parents-in-law because you are now related to your partner and he claims to be one of them.&lt;br /&gt;
I am the kind of calm person who needs his place, but my husband&amp;#39;s family is full of extroverts who do not understand this perspective.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;It has caused much more heartache than it should over the years (I wish I had this article back then), but I&amp;#39;m glad my husband understands and steps in when needed.&lt;br /&gt;
Others are not so lucky. I have seen couples divorce because of their parents-in-law and not because of problems between the couples.&lt;br /&gt;
So my advice would be that both parties present the worst of their families and how you can fix the problems before they get bigger than the two of you." />
