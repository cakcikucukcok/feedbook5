  <title>Because I&#39;m Suitable - Allison P. Uribe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, he saw it all to be good except for one thing: man was alone. It was then that God created a suitable helper, a wife. Man would no longer be alone but the two would become one flesh. Being a wife is a journey of its own and being the wife of a law enforcement officer is a unique journey. As a wife on duty, whether it be through law enforcement, fire, or military, we share the protection of our spouse with our cities, counties, and country. Take a journey with a wife whose marriage had an uncertain future and see how God transformed her life once she surrendered it all. It was realizing that her role as a wife was prewritten and ordained by her maker which made her put her faith into action. With marriages falling apart every day in the law enforcement community, there is no better time than now to fight for our marriages with God by our side. Who better to seek council and guidance from than the one who created marriage in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;" />

    	<p>In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, he saw it all to be good except for one thing: man was alone. It was then that God created a suitable helper, a wife. Man would no longer be alone but the two would become one flesh. Being a wife is a journey of its own and being the wife of a law enforcement officer is a unique journey. As a wife on duty, whether it be through law enforcement, fire, or military, we share the protection of our spouse with our cities, counties, and country. Take a journey with a wife whose marriage had an uncertain future and see how God transformed her life once she surrendered it all. It was realizing that her role as a wife was prewritten and ordained by her maker which made her put her faith into action. With marriages falling apart every day in the law enforcement community, there is no better time than now to fight for our marriages with God by our side.
