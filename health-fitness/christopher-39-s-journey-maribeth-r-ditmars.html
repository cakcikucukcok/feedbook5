  <title>Christopher&#39;s Journey - Maribeth R. Ditmars</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poignant and bittersweet, &lt;I&gt;Christopher&#39;s Journey&lt;/I&gt; is the true story of a remarkable young man&#39;s battle with leukemia and the lives that he touches along the way. Author Maribeth Ditmars chronicles her son Christopher&#39;s chemotherapy treatments, his irrepressible antics, and finally, his insightful acceptance of his own illness.&lt;/P&gt;
&quot;Maribeth Ditmars writes with a special sense of humor so reminiscent of Chris. Her understanding of the critical need for laughter during such difficult times is a valuable message to all who read her words. Chris&#39;s story, as told from a mother&#39;s perspective, will be helpful to others as they journey through treatment, recovery, and sometimes loss.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
-&lt;B&gt;Anna Maria Gentile&lt;/B&gt;, Regional Director, The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society&lt;/P&gt;
&quot;I was incredibly moved by this story. It made me go home and hug my kids. Although I cried several times during the reading, I never wanted to stop. I was in awe of Chris&#39;s spirituality, acceptance, and peace. &lt;I&gt;Christopher&#39;s Journey&lt;/I&gt; is a beautiful book.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
-&lt;B&gt;Susan Burns&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Sarasota Magazine&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&quot;&lt;I&gt;Christopher&#39;s Journey&lt;/I&gt; gives voice to those children&#39;s physical and emotional struggles endured during treatment. This book will be a valuable tool for anyone who is touched by a child&#39;s courageous fight against cancer.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
