  <title>A Woman&#39;s Tell, a True Story - Evelyn Eason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was raised in poor neighborhoods with many brothers and
sisters. I had an average education.I was well known in
high school, made good grades, and achieved a lot of awards.
Then I had to face one of my biggest struggles, becoming a
teen mother. I eventually had to give up friends and graduated
after only 3 years of high school.
Kids do not realize the result of the choices that they make may
affect the rest of their lives. I am going to take you through
a journey of one of the most popular choices teenagers choose.
Unprotected sex is one of the most popular choice a teenager would
make without thinking about the affects it would have. In this story,
you would see the difficulties as a teenage mom struggling through
the drama of dealing with her daughters father and his family.
Losing her faith and finding it again. She turns what could have been
the most devastating turning point in her life into her motivation to
become someone her daughter could look up to and be proud of. As
an adult, she has more insight than a person does her age. Parents
I hope this will help you find the strength and courage to talk to
your children about safe sex and start at an earlier age than normal.
That talk may save you and your child some devastating problems in
the end. Teenagers make wiser choices let your parents or someone
grown you trust know that you are having those feeling before you
go out and do it. If you are going to have sex, always use protection,
because it just may save your life in many ways." />
