  <title>When God Speaks… - Writer For The King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear Reader
In prepping for Christmas 2009 I asked the Lord for ideas. He said, write a daily
book of My words to them. I was excited and anxious; it was already December
1. I sat down after work with my journal and Bible and suddenly He began to
speak out the date and the words for that day. If my thoughts got on the page, He
would say, take that out! The project took less than two weeks. I was astounded
at His love coming through the pages. I was broken by His tenderness, grace and
desire to have fun with us and lead us into times of joy with Him.
On January 10, 2010 He told me to print 100 copies and where to sell them.
He had already told my friend to read through the book and edit for spelling errors
Id missed.
He has not allowed me to put any personal words in these pages. They are His
words to you. He made you; knows you. He loves you just as you are: man,
woman, teenager, child. He will speak to you daily as you learn how to hear and
recognize His wonderful voice. He calls us to Come Hear My Voice!
