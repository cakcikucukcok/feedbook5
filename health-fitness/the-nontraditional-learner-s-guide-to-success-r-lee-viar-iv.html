  <title>The Nontraditional Learner’S Guide  to  Success - R. Lee Viar Iv</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book investigates the influence of an informal support network on the growing population of nontraditional learners and explores the implications of this support network for learner persistence and success. Obviously, the end objective is success for the nontraditional learner. This success can manifest itself in the form of an intrinsic motivational purpose, for career advancement or continuing education. Whatever the reason, education is a precious gift and degree attainment should be encouraged, regardless of the learner&#39;s stage of life.
Who should read this book? Nontraditional learners, instructors of nontraditional learners, the support networks, and the nontraditional learners&#39; mentors, as well as, counselors who are working with adult learners, will benefit from the insights provided herein. In addition, it is my sincerest hope that this book can act as a guide to assist working adult learners who enter institutions of advanced learning later in life to achieve their goal of earning a degree. 
The book establishes a theoretical foundation based on an examination of current trends in education in general. The experiences of the nontraditional learner, both positive and negative, are introduced. The discussion of challenges facing the nontraditional learner as they pursue their college education is covered. A nontraditional learner reading this book can conduct a mini-assessment to determine if they have similar characteristics. The book further highlights some of these commonalities so that the reader can identify with the experience and determine what they need to do to succeed, and whether they will be successful in their educational journey. 
The book is concluded by creating recommendations to help the nontraditional learner to be able to develop the characteristics needed to succeed and overcome the challenges that they will face as they pursue their education." />
