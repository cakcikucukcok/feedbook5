  <title>Be Happy or I&#39;ll Scream! - Sheri Lynch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Be Happy or I&#39;ll Scream&lt;/i&gt; is for every married woman who has found just the tiniest bit of disconnect between the image of a perfect family in her head-think &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; or &quot;The Huxtables&quot;-and the evidence in front of her eyes.  Instead of darling and compliant rosy-cheeked children and an adorably tolerant husband ready to go along with zany shenanigans, most women are faced with: kids who view family outings with all the enthusiasm of hardened inmates forced to bust rocks in roadside Alabama and a man who would trade every last one of her kooky ideas for a just a teeny little bit more sex and a hot meal on the table at six. &lt;br&gt;Sheri Lynch, co-cost of radio&#39;s syndicated &lt;i&gt;Bob &amp; Sheri&lt;/i&gt;, is a superb humorist of modern marriage, mores, and motherhood. Her &lt;i&gt;Hello, My Name Is Mommy&lt;/i&gt; decoded the pitfalls of pregnancy and trials of new motherhood. &lt;i&gt;Be Happy or I&#39;ll Scream&lt;/i&gt; taps into the wackier, even more wonderful world of family and husband management, kid-raising, and sanity maintenance in the face of it all.  Her take on what life is really like inside a marriage-as opposed to what it looks like on the holiday card version of same-will ring both wacky and true to any woman who was ever foolish enough to dream of the perfect marriage and family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
