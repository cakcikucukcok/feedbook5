  <title>Liberation - Karina Carrel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;$1 of each book sold will be donated to the Leukaemia Foundation &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Karina Carrel, the devastation of being diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma was a crushing blow. The intense love for her family gave her the strength to face the journey itself, while dealing with the possibility of losing her battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has taken Karina two years to finally get her story on paper, with two primary messages in her vision: to raise lymphoma awareness while also helping anyone reading her story who has been affected by cancer. Reliving her experiences has been a secondary journey in itself. This is her story of how she broke through the chains of cancer, through the highs and the lows, for her very own piece of salvation -- Liberation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every tear that has been written into this book has been worth it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
