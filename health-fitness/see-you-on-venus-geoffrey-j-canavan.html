  <title>See You On Venus - Geoffrey j. Canavan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="See You on Venus! is a book about learning to let go of your investment in self-imposed limitations so that you can dismantle the blocks you have created to your innate freedom, success, choice, happiness and completion. 
It is also a book about hope, observation and reconnecting with your lost self — the self of perfect success, happiness and harmony. Like a half-remembered song, each one of us carries a distant memory of how that perfection feels, but this memory is clouded by what we have learned on our journey through life.
The message is simple: you have the power to bring together the parts of your self that have become fragmented and to become one daring and truthful realization of the perfect star you truly are.
See You on Venus! shows that you can stop undermining yourself and that you can hold the belief of the truth of what you can be. Remember, never lose moments in your own time when a decision to make a new choice or to see the world in a new way can be so freeing. 
Whatever aspect of your life you want to focus on, however you define ‘success’ or ‘happiness’, wherever you want to take that inner perfection, it’s really only a matter of realizing the unlimited resource that you already are (and always were) and reconnecting with what you have forgotten about your perfect self.
We all start perfectly successful. We all start complete. We acquire failure. 
Real success is based on who we are within rather than anything we come by externally. The willingness to look at ourselves in a light of perfection, success, inclusion and completion provides a real opportunity to move forward in the true meaning of peace and happiness.
“In this book Geoffrey Canavan explores the intrinsic nature of success and produces a universal road map for real life that can be tailored to corporate or individual needs. A must read for business and individual decision-making.”
Jerry Flynn, MD Sony Pictures
“There is a way of thinking that will bring peace and happiness into our life; that will free us to the memory of a perfectly whole, completely loving and forgotten Self. It is an awareness that mystics and philosophers through the ages have tried to explain and teach how to access… In a world made from the belief that there is ‘something wrong with me,’ See You On Venus, offers a refreshing and needed alternative to the beliefs that have made the ego’s perception seem true. In a world given to finding better ways to defend ourselves and maintain the ‘distance’ between us, it offers a way to find real healing through forgiveness and joining. For anyone willing to be truly happy or to ‘risk’ finding the truth of who and what they really are, See You On Venus, will be a blessing and a joy!“
Tom Carpenter, Author and founder of The Forgiveness Project
&quot;More than ever, individuals, families, organizations, and governments need to create a vision for success that helps to deliver true happiness, abundance and freedom. Geoffrey Canavan shows us the way.&quot;
Robert Holden Ph.D author of Shift Happens, Happiness Now. Success Intelligence and Be Happy
“As things tighten up, the drive to succeed grows stronger. Widespread exploration of getting to the root and playing the inner game of succeeding in life - achieving results from the inside out - is fast gaining traction. Geoffrey Canavan presents as highly evolved, insightful and succinct a view as you&#39;ll get. World class!”
Stephen Russell, the Barefoot Doctor, author of Supercharged Taoist and 12 other titles
“In an innovative and groundbreaking way Geoffrey Canavan challenges us to expand our thinking and re-evaluate how we do business. He offers a powerful and simple process for recalibrating critical thinking in order to identify sustainable solutions and develop a clear, success-focused strategy for managing any level of change in every area of business and life.” 
Brendan Foster, partner Grant Thornton Ireland and former President of Association of Chartered Certified Accountants
“... a self-growth manual that offers a radical new way of looking at recurring problems in life, love and business.”
Olaf Tyaransen, Journalist (Penthouse, MoJo and Rolling Stone magazines) and Author
“This book provides valuable insights into brotherly love, painful loss, acceptance, and post-traumatic growth. It reflects on hope beyond loss, and provides a candid roadmap from the writer’s personal experience on how to ride the wave of uncertainty that is the experience of living. See you on Venus may just contain a glistening nugget for you, a touchstone that grounds your identity, bringing you full circle to help you discover the person you can be.”
