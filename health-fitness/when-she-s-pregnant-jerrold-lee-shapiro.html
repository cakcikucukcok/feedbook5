  <title>When She’S Pregnant - Jerrold Lee Shapiro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Truly a landmark book
--Martin Greenberg, M.D., psychiatrist and author, Birth of a Father
When a couple decides to have a baby, it&#39;s not only the woman who undergoes changes during pregnancy. The father, too, experiences many changes and it&#39;s important that his needs and concerns be addressed.  In When Shes Pregnant, noted psychologist Jerrold Lee Shapiro helps fathers-to-be understand their new roles, get involved, and prepare for fatherhood. This is a supportive guide for men, addressing their anxieties, fears, and unfamiliarity with imminent fatherhood. It demystifies the nine months of pregnancy, explains step-by-step the labor and delivery process, the experiences of the new mother and baby, and the new family.
&quot;The experiences of men during pregnancy are spelled out with exquisite and sensitive breadth. Filled with information and tips for about-to-be parents. I strongly recommend this book to all couples contemplating or expecting a baby.... Will help the family get off to a good start.&quot;                                         -Martin Greenberg, M.D.
--
&quot;Everyone who works with expectant families and everyone having a baby should read this book. It will make crossing that one-way bridge to fatherhood immeasurably smoother.&quot;
