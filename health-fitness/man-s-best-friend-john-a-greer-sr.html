      <meta name="description" content="Alofus, an Australian shepherd pup, has never been one to give up. When his mother goes into premature labor, Alofus is the only puppy to survive; even then, his link to life is tenuous. His owners, Nana and PawPaw, whisk him to the veterinarian, where he is watched around the clock. His story so touches the heart of everyone in the city that its citizens wait with bated breath to hear his fate.
When six weeks passes and Alofus is now a cute, furry bundle of joy, everyone celebratesincluding ten-year-old Little Jay, Nana and PawPaws eldest grandson. Little Jay, along with his father and mother, become Alofuss proud new owners, and the entire family forges a strong bond with the dog.
Alofus fiercely protects his family from harm. But when Jays father, a policeman, starts investigating a sinister crime syndicate, the criminals take their revenge on Alofus, nearly beating him to death. Once again, the town rallies behind the dog and determines to put the perpetrators behind barsand clean up their city once and for all.
An inspiring tale about the love between man and dog, &lt;i&gt;Mans Best Friend&lt;/i&gt; will warm your heart." />
