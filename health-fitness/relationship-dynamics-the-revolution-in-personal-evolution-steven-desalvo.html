  <title>Relationship Dynamics: The Revolution in Personal Evolution - Steven DeSalvo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself wishing that life came with an instruction manual? You know-the kind of &amp;ldquo;how-to guide&amp;rdquo;-that gives you information that solves real problems: problems you encounter each day and challenges we all face in the world today? Your wish has come true. Relationship Dynamics is exactly that handbook you&amp;#39;ve hoped for, an instruction book you need to navigate your life and create healthier relationship dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the first book in the revolutionary EVOLVE series, Relationship Dynamics looks at how we create and sustain healthy relationships using essential principles applied from Permaculture, including observation, resilience, and sustainability. In Relationship Dynamics, you will learn how to develop deeper intimacy in all relationships, how to sustain relationships by following the six steps to conflict resolution and establishing healthy boundaries, the importance of commitments, as well as how to identify and navigate emotional drama and dysfunction with others.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EVOLVE is a series of books about the discovery of the meaning of life and how we can thrive as responsible Adults in a world of extreme change. With seven billion people on this planet and growing, the question we now face is: How can we share this planet together and Thrive? How do we live in harmony with each other, with the earth, and with all plant and animal life on this planet? We must all do our part to make human evolution a conscious affair, one in which we each raise our awareness and take personal responsibility for living together in harmony and peace. &amp;ldquo;If ever there was a time in human history, now is the time we must come together on this planet to form deeper bonds and connections in our relationships to insure our survival.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We have the awareness to make our world a utopia, but only if we step up to the challenge and EVOLVE.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Start your journey today with Relationship Dynamics!&lt;/p&gt;" />
