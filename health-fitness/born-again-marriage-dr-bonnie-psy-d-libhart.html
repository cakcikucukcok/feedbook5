      <meta name="description" content="Tony and Bonnie&amp;#39;s marriage endured many storms...From their survival of the press box crash at the Indy 500 to their struggle to hold onto their lives in an Arkansas tornado.  But the whirlwind of divorce wreaked the most damaged on their lives.  Their search for happiness in power, prestige, and possessions fed it winds.  To support that search, Bonnie spent more and more hours at her job as a TV talk show host while Tony devoted more and more of himself to his company.  Finally there wasn&amp;#39;t left for each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the storm winds had done their damage, they left behind only the splintered remains of the Libhart&amp;#39;s marriage.  That was when Bonnie called out to God- and He answered her cry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born-Again Marriage is a story of wreckage and rebuilding.  But more that it&amp;#39;s a handbook you can use to look at your own priorities.  The unique Analysis-Action sections at the end of each priorities are-and a chance to set new ones.&lt;br&gt;Born-Again Marriage offers an exciting story of struggle and romance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You, too, can have a Born-Again relationship, if you would please.
