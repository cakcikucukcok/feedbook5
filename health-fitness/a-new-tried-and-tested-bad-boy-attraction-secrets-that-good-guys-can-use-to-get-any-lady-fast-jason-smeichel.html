  <title>A New Tried And Tested Bad Boy Attraction Secrets That Good Guys Can Use To Get Any Lady Fast. - Jason Smeichel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered why the wrong men feel so right? It has been said that ladies are attracted to bad boys. But the truth is, no lady wants a man who will hurt her, abuse her and disrespect her. &amp;nbsp;The &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; that many women are often attracted to is not a man with bad character, but &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; in style and personality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A man who is loyal and loving to the woman but has a strong and almost carefree personality; a man who is nicely dangerous and exciting; who brings the good kind of drama and makes her blood run.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Women are generally attracted to the danger associated with bad boys, which creates a thrill which most believe they cannot get with good guys.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this book are some of the reasons why women are attracted to bad boys! Grab it.&lt;br /&gt;
