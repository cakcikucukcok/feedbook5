  <title>The Uncommon Single - Nicole Porter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I believe that every season has a purpose that prepares us for the next.
Recognize that every season in your life is a training ground for you.
You cant always see it, but God is adding to you. You are growing in
your faith. God is molding you and preparing you for your destiny.
Learning to love the single life is one of the best decisions that Ive
made in my life. Ive been single since 2013 and Ive never been
happier. Sure, I dont have a man around to open pickle jars, squish
spiders, or lift heavy things, but I also know that one day God will
bless me with my soul mate.
Your singledom will not last a lifetime. The worst thing you can do is
to panic and think you have to find someone immediately or your life
is over. This air of desperation will zap the life out of a relationship
with yourself or with anyone new for that matter. It makes you blind
to the obvious red flags and puts you in all kinds of compromising
situations.
I implore you to embrace this special opportunity to get to know
yourself and be happy. If you are uncomfortable spending time alone
with yourself, what makes you think anyone else will feel comfortable
spending time with you? This can be quite a challenge to someone
that has continuously filled up their life with someone else only to
discover that they really dont know or like themselves at all.
In this book, you will discover that there are three characteristics of
an uncommon single. They are:
1. The uncommon single overcomes disappointments.
2. The uncommon single prepares for the future.
3. The uncommon single lives by faith." />
