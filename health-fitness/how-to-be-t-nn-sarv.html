  <title>How to be - Tõnn Sarv</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the end of the body/mind/spirit books&amp;#39; overflow. After publishing this book, there is no need to publish anything about how to find your true destiny or your inner truth/child/man/woman/guardian/angel. Or how to fight for your rights, how to achieve success or how to make sure all your wishes are granted. Or how to win the game called life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to take it? How to be? The answer is here. Don&amp;#39;t take it, leave it. Don&amp;#39;t take it personally. Don&amp;#39;t take it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight is over, the search is over. No more loss or victory, no searching or finding. You&amp;rsquo;re serene and fulfilled at last. Nothing can dissolve you or mislead you any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, there is nothing to discover, there is no lightness or enlightenment at all. You, by yourself, built this dark room around yourself. You are covered by yourself, you are sitting in yourself. You, by yourself, cannot see anything but yourself. This dark room is actually yourself and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come out. Look around. Let the sunshine in. And then, in broad daylight, you can see that the darkness didn&amp;rsquo;t really exist. The cover around you, yourself, was just a myth, just a story you were told by yourself and others. It was not real thing. It was just an imaginary, yet useful, tool in society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing to do and there&amp;rsquo;s no need to do anything anyway. If you leave yourself out, there&amp;rsquo;s no one who can get hurt. If you&amp;rsquo;re not there, no one can harm you, hurt you or insult you. That&amp;rsquo;s how simple it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book includes quotes from Laozi, the Taoist sage, and some themes come from Buddhist scriptures, although these are not worded in the traditional way, to avoid unnecessary resistance from people who don&amp;#39;t like any religion at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sits well on the self-help/spirituality section of the market, although it&amp;#39;s not an ordinary self-help book. You will not find any demands or commandments, any rules or restrictions in this book. No tasks, no exercises, no to-do lists, nothing to compete or complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to be. The short answer is simple: &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t take anything personally.&lt;/em&gt; If anybody wants a longer answer, read the book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
