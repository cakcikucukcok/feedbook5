  <title>It&#39;s Never Quite What You Think - Grace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its Never Quite What You Think
With all the challenges and difficulties of parenting, when all is said and done, if you&#39;ve learned to mother yourself, at least you don&#39;t walk away from the experience empty handed.
In mothering adopted four- and six-year-old daughters from a foreign country, the searing heartbreak of broken dreams compelled me to evaluate the layers of mass consciousness and societal conditioning about what everyone believes love is and what love should do.  
Acquiring self-knowledge is demonstrated as the way to release ancient beliefs and fears that perpetuate guilt, self-sacrificing, superstition, or long-term suffering.  This includes any handed-down text that promotes dependency on a force other than the God Mind mastery within each of us to create our own reality.
My own stumbles in parenting transform themselves into steps of liberation as my story evolves from the taboo of a mother who leaves her home, into a message of freedom in the song that it sings: Love is not held in the captivity of expectation, like the birds, it is free to go as it chooses." />
