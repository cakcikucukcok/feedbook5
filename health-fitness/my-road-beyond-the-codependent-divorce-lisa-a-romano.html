  <title>My Road Beyond the Codependent Divorce - Lisa A. Romano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ending a toxic relationship can sometimes make us feel like we are going insane. Because we are so enmeshed with the other person, we feel nothing but fear, doubt, confusion, shame and even guilt when we consider terminating the relationship. Although we can hear a little voice inside our heads urging us to move forward, all too often our worries overwhelm us and cause us to stay stuck. We no longer know whose thoughts or feelings are in our heads. All we can feel is fear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are contemplating ending a relationship you know in your heart must end, but are struggling with crippling negative emotions, Lisas story is just the right dose of inspiration you will need as you begin facing your new roads ahead. No stranger to heartache, Lisa bravely ended her dysfunctional marriage and took her three small children with her. With nothing to cling to but hope, Lisa courageously learned to navigate her way through unknown terrains, and eventually found the will to even love again. &lt;br /&gt;
