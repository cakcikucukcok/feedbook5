Born in the big city of Manhattan, she and her family move from New York to northern Michigan, where her father, an English professor and show business biographer, teaches at a college on a breathtaking island on Lake Huron. Her mother is a ballet teacher, much loved by her students, whom she equally adores. On the island, the three Manchester kids make friends with the grandchildren of neighbours who live nearby. In their adventures, an old barn becomes the starship Enterprise. The field down the road becomes a graveyard. They go hiking and explore caves. As they grow up, Aurora and her brothers make lifelong friendships and have lots of fun along the way&amp;hellip; until the tragic day when their whole world falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://burnstownpublishing.com/product/great-turtle-island/&quot;&gt;http://burnstownpublishing.com/product/great-turtle-island/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
