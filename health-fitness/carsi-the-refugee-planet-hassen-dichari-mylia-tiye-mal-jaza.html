  <title>Carsi, the Refugee Planet - Hassen Dichari, Mylia Tiye Mal Jaza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Carsi: The Refugee Planet is the fi rst of the Carsian Trilogy by Hassen Dichari. The book will be based off
of five major concepts; I have accumulated for seven years until completing in 2011 when I was 21 years old. Christianity, Lords the Rings book series, accomplishments of England and Spain, and my own personal battle with my eating disorder I briefl y went through in 2004- 2005, when this book fi rst came into surface in my mind, and Ufos that they are not extraterrestrials but Demons fl ying around in vehicles of deception and lies. There are fi ve races of creatures that live in Galaxy Dichri called the Gatekeepers, Glushers, Fisheon, Humans and Gulpers. The Gatekeepers speak Felish, Fisheon speak Fishi, Gulpers speak Gulpish, Glushers speak Glushi, and the Humans speak Human.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
According to Earths terms, Felish is similar to Spanish, Fishi to Arabic, Gulpish to Chinese, Glushi to Russian, and Human to Swahili. The books will be based off of many accomplishments, organizations and beliefs that exist on planet Earth today and over the past 2,000 years. Most of the books in the trilogy will be based on religion, with the Gatish race (called Gatekeepers) being the savior of the creatures of Galaxy Dichri. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sakim is the head fallen Gatekeeper and his followers, other fallen Gatekeepers, are called Mikplutons. Originally named Lucius, Sakim was the Emperor of Carsi 2,000 years ago. He was cast out of Carsi by the Creator itself, along with a third of the Gatish population for leaving the one and only faith of the Gatekeepers  Moral Order. Since then, he has been preparing to release the ultimate lie to the four races of Galaxy Dichri (Glushers, Humans, Fisheon and Gulpers). The time has fi nally come for Sakim to return in physical form to deceive, devour and destroy Human, Fisheon, Glusher and Gulper lives and souls with the ultimate lie.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 The Creator so loves the Galaxy that it does not wish for its creation to suffer like this. So, from the beginning of time, a race of divine kind was created to spread the word of Moral Order after Lucius and a third of the Gatish population of Gatekeepers were cast out of Carsi. When the word of Moral Order would be heard in every country in Gateiniya and Sogyoni, there would be more evil than ever before. To bring an end to it, the Creator would give permission to Sakim to return in physical form. At the same time the Creator would allow the crucifi xion of the Gatekeepers to begin so that the other four races would one day live on Carsi, the Refugee Planet, after this historic event,  instead of living in eternal damnation with Sakim on his spacecraft of doom." />
