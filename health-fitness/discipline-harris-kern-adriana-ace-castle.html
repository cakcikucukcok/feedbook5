  <title>Discipline - Harris Kern, Adriana Ace Castle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you suffer from &lt;b&gt;procrastination&lt;/b&gt;? &lt;br&gt;
Do you suffer from &lt;b&gt;poor goal management&lt;/b&gt;? &lt;br&gt;
Do you ever wonder why its so hard to &lt;b&gt;focus&lt;/b&gt;? &lt;br&gt;
Are you &lt;b&gt;disorganized&lt;/b&gt;? &lt;br&gt;
Do you let &lt;b&gt;negative emotions&lt;/b&gt; derail your goals? &lt;br&gt;
Do you &lt;b&gt;sleep too much&lt;/b&gt; and have a difficult time getting out of bed each morning? &lt;br&gt;
Do you have what it takes to compete in this economically challenged marketplace? &lt;br&gt;
When times are rough, its easy to feel overwhelmed and just accept things the way they are. &lt;br&gt;
However, successful people are ones who take control of their life via discipline. &lt;br&gt;
Discipline is the defining element in your life. With it you can achieve anything; without it you will struggle to exist. &lt;br&gt;
No matter how many books you read, if you don&#39;t commit yourself to self-discipline, the books will not help and you are back where you started. &lt;br&gt;
What if discipline was a meta-skill composed of easy steps that you could learn? &lt;br&gt;
How would that change your life? &lt;br&gt;
Harris Kern and Adriana Ace Castle have distilled their combined 55 years of experience as life coaches and organizational consultants into a knowledge manual that features the &lt;b&gt;10 Commandments for Success&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
This book simplifies the complexity of gaining the ability to discipline yourself into ten principles that you can understand and use right away. &lt;br&gt;
Let us help you &lt;b&gt;train your mind&lt;/b&gt; to build &lt;b&gt;structure&lt;/b&gt; and to live life with a &lt;b&gt;sense of urgency&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
Take the first step in your journey to achieving your goals by reading &lt;b&gt;DISCIPLINE: Take Control of Your Life. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
