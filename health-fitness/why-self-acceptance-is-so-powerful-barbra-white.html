  <title>Why Self Acceptance Is so Powerful - Barbra White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When you welcome your feelings into your heart, you decalre to your Self, No-nothing is separate from Love. You can know Love. But feeling with self-compassionis to BE Love.
	Everything can be alchemized into Love through feeling, because Love IS. Love IS ALL things. Fear is Love. Anger is Love. By feeling the emotions, pain, or wound you have deemed unlovable, you anchor the LOVE YOU ARE within your being. Such is the power of self-acceptance.
	Declare to yourself:
	I am ready to feel.
	I am willing to feelthus healing the pains of my past.
	God supports my healing.
	When I simply feel with compassion, my Soul, God does the healing.
	I allow this healing to happen with grace and ease.
	Feeling IS healing. Once you give an emotion full permission, it will spontaneously, organically release. Dont try to fix or educate the feeling. Embrace it, feel it, let it dance in your heart. Bring all the things into your heart.
	As you love your feelings, you give your wounded inner child the love he or she so desperately needed. You SHOW him or her LOVE. When you FEEL with self-acceptance and non-judgment, you are healing the wounded child (pain body, emotional body, Mud, etc.) and giving yourself lasting inner peace.
	By loving your feelings, you anchor in your consciousness.
YOU ARE LOVE." />
