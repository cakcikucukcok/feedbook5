  <title>Romantic Suicide - Monroe Mann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Romantic Suicide is a book for the romantic who just cant seem to get it right.  Its also for the romantic who wants to get it right the first time.  In the pages within, I am going to share with you the 45 unbreakable rules I have learned over the years for avoiding what I call romantic suicidei.e. doing something foolish (but preventable) during the first few months of a relationship that scares her (or him) off.  It is not a book on how to put your best foot forward; it is a book on how to avoid putting your foot in your mouth.  It is not a book on how to present yourself in your best light; it is a book on how to avoid covering up your light with a scary shadow.  And it is not a book on how to keep the girl (or guy) of your dreams; it is a book on how to avoid losing her.  Read this book and embrace its lessons and you will never again commit romantic suicide.  I learned all of this the hard way.  If you read this book, you won&#39;t have to." />
