  <title>What&#39;s up Doc? - Dr. David P. Kalin M.D. M.P.H.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;WHATS UP, DOC?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a series of essays in which DR. DAVID P. KALIN, M.D., M.P.H., answers common questions asked of him with regard to health and medicine during his many years as a family physician.
Illustrations combined with these essays extend a broader sense of appreciation not only to the doctor and his relationship with the patient but also of the doctors own creative effort and striving for as sense of balance and expression in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August 21, 2004&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book Review - Stephen Z. Smith, M.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;WHATS UP, DOC?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;David P. Kalin, M.D., M.P.H.
&lt;div&gt;The Healthplace, P.O. Box 6009, Palm Harbor, FL 34684
&lt;div&gt;ISBN:	1-4010-8801-5
&lt;p&gt;Order:  Xlibris Corporation, 1-888-795-4274, www.Xlibris.com, orders@xlibris.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	An unusual book with an uncommon style, this tight little work of 100 or so pages should be consumed by the medically nave.  With thirteen small chapters lighted with frequent bold printing, hand drawn sketches and pithy one liners, this reading favors the quick learn rather than the plodder.  Offered as a conversation rather than a lecture, this information has the qualities of attachment and relevance rather than being pedantic.  Some questions could be anticipated such as cholesterol numbers, vasectomy side effects, STDs and the like.  Other chapters are more sensational in title, like Whats With Those Chinese Balls?  Yet these headliners really belie very useful if not folksy descriptions.  Probably few physicians will read this without some prodding, but this report stands as one physician telling others to read and remember that direct language registers with patients.  Not all of us are comfortable with this brotherly relating to patients, but learning some holistic and other non traditional medicine should be helpful.  For a modest price and easy wording, this book can be accepted as worthy for patient consumption.&lt;/p&gt;" />
