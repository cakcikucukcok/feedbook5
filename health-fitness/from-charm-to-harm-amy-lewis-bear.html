  <title>From Charm to Harm: - Amy Lewis Bear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The lack of language to identify emotional abuse and its aftermath among couples is a major barrier to recognition and treatment. From Charm to Harm breaks down this barrier by providing simple words and definitions that name and explain harmful interactions between intimate partners. Many of these interactions, although emotionally toxic, are hard to distinguish from the normal experience of being in a relationship.
From Charm to Harm will empower you to recognize and describe the psychological destruction wrought by an intimate partner who claims to love you. It will provide you with ways to protect yourself and your loved ones in current and future relationships. 
Determine if your mate is emotionally abusive, the effects on you, and how you may be enabling the abuse. 
Find out how and why charm turns to harm when one partner has a deep-seated need to control the other partner. 
Discover why people abuse their lovers, why their lovers allow it, how it happens, and its aftermath. 
Learn how easy it is to get caught up in the oppressive cycle of emotional abuse and how you might be contributing to your own suffering. 
Learn how to stand up to an abusive partner, get treatment for both partners, and make the choice to leave or stay in the relationship.
From Charm to Harm will help you stop the cycle of emotional abuse and claim your right to be loved and respected by your mate." />
