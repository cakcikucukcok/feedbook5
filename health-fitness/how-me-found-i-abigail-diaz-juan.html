  <title>How Me Found I - Abigail Diaz Juan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Today we live in such a fear-driven society in every aspect of our lives. One of the main tenets of this book turns your fear into Torque to be used to transmute paralyzing fear into the courageous action needed to create forward movement and accomplish your desired reality.  Abby Juan&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What if you were able to grow into adulthood naturally; not the personality you adopted to fit into society, but the person you actually truly desired to be  inherently authentic, true to yourself, and successfully living your passion? What if you could become that person again; the one you were always destined to be? Would you step into that life, if shown how?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In How Me Found I, author Abigail Diaz Juan answers these questions and presents a guidebook showing how you can attain balance, harmony, and greatness in your world. She shares her personal physical, intellectual, and spiritual experiences and what she learned. Abby outlines the Natural Person Paradigm and how it can be used for personal transformation to improve your life. She shares that when you allow Life to take you on a journey, it unveils your true purpose.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How Me Found I communicates that if you allow your inner self to guide you, the path opens up and reveals itself, and life then becomes a series of pivotal steps leading you in the right direction on your path to greatness.&lt;/P&gt;" />
