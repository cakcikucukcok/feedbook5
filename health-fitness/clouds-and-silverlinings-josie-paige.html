  <title>Clouds and Silverlinings - Josie Paige</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This segment begins with a terrible tragedy; Angels mother has been involved in a fatal accident thus her world seemingly has come far too quickly to an end. What will she do now? Where shall she go? How will she cope? Then at the funeral a stranger comes and offers her a chance to meet a family member that she didnt even know she had and an opportunity to change her life forever - should she take the chance? What would her mother say she should do? Why has she never met any other family? Maybe she could get some questions answered about that at least. This could be the opportunity she has been waiting for or the worst decision she has ever made in her life. This could be the start of the rest of her life. In more ways than one. This chance of a new life would send her to Europe where she meets her soul-mate - a woman who sweeps her off her feet so fast it seems too good. So begins a vastly different life that brings challenges to overcome with a new family behind her." />
