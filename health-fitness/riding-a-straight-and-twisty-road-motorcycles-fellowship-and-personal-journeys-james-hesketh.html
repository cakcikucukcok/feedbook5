  <title>Riding a Straight and Twisty Road: Motorcycles, Fellowship, and Personal Journeys - James Hesketh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;EM&gt;A celebration of motorcycle culture and of lives recovered from active addiction&lt;/EM&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Before &lt;EM&gt;Easy Rider&lt;/EM&gt;, there was &lt;EM&gt;The Wild One&lt;/EM&gt;. From these films sprang the indelible image of the American biker-wanton, daring, and lawless. Seemingly dedicated only to their own freedom and pleasure, these road rebels tore through the complacency of the suburban American mid-century, with a roar that has yet to die down. Yet something has changed. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Author and avid motorcyclist James Hesketh takes you with him on the &#39;straight and twisty&#39; road he&#39;s traveled from addiction to recovery-his motorcycle with him every inch of the way. Drawing from archival information, cultural references, and interviews, Hesketh chronicles the changing history of motorcycle culture, beginning with the infamous 1947 Hollister Rally that inspired the &#39;biker image,&#39; and progressing to the recovery lifestyle and motorcycling. Featuring &#39;insider&#39; accounts by clean and sober riders, and illustrated with vivid photographs, this book is a must-read, not just for those who ride, but for anyone interested in recovery." />
