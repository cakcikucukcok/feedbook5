  <title>Saved by Grace - Marc E. Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The testimonies that you will read on the following pages are personal stories of courage, hope, faith and strength in the face of adversity. Some will make you cry, some will make you laugh and some will simply bring home the fact that God is.
A Book of Triumphs
and
Impossibilities
There is definitely a higher power up there in the heavens. My co-author Andreka Eberhart and I know this first hand because I was brought back from not being able to see at all, to being able to see; not being able to walk at all, to walking with confidence  to being on the brink of certain death to doing things I once did before and sometimes better than before  and Andreka&#39;s bout with MS had her brain ravished, where doctors gave her little chance of a complete recovery. We contribute all of our health and wealth and blessings to God  Jesus Christ  our Lord and Savior.
What is a testimony? The dictionary defines a testimony as a statement under oath, proof or evidence of something. My definition of a testimony is simply a lesson: a lesson in life, in truth and the knowledge of God and His promises. It is my hope that your faith will be strengthened and you will have greater hope, peace and joy by reading these testimonies and that you will discover beyond a shadow of a doubt that with God, all things are possible!" />
