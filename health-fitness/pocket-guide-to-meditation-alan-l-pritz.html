  <title>Pocket Guide to Meditation - Alan L. Pritz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pocket Guide To Meditation&lt;/i&gt; focuses on meditation as spiritual practice. It is a universal tool that helps practitioners forge deeper connections with Spirit and, as Alan Pritz states, Meditation delivers one of the most profound experiences of life, joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond its inherently spiritual purpose and value, meditation offers physical and mental benefits as well. These include:&lt;br /&gt;
 Stress Reduction&lt;br /&gt;
 Immune system enhancement&lt;br /&gt;
 Greater energy, clarity, and productivity&lt;br /&gt;
 Increased intellectual capacity, emotional intelligence, and social performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What people have said about &lt;i&gt;Pocket Guide To Meditation&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a great &lt;i&gt;Pocket Guide To Meditation&lt;/i&gt;. This book should be given to everybody who enters a doctors office, so they hopefully wont need to come back. The HMOs should underwrite this project; it would save them money, which is their bottom line. &lt;br /&gt;Larry Dossey, Author of &lt;i&gt;Healing Words&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Power of Prayer &amp; Practice of Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan has taken a big subject and made it friendly, interesting, and useful for everyone. This is the perfect little book to carry around in purse or pocket for quick moments of inspiration.&lt;br /&gt; Lilias Folan, Host of PBS series, Lilias!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great resource to begin your meditation journey. A wonderful guide to explore the classical practices of meditation in a very clear and understandable manner; a great resource for the beginner and advanced practitioner alike. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is on the journey to integrate more pause, reflection, and spirituality into their life.&lt;br /&gt;Kevin Cashman, Author of &lt;i&gt;Leadership From The Inside Out&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
