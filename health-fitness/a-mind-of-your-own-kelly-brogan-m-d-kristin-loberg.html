  <title>A Mind of Your Own - Kelly Brogan, M.D., Kristin Loberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Named one of the top health and wellness books for 2016 by &lt;em&gt;MindBodyGreen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is not a disease. It is a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen a shocking increase in antidepressant use the world over, with 1 in 4 women starting their day with medication. These drugs have steadily become the panacea for everything from grief, irritability, panic attacks, to insomnia, PMS, and stress.&amp;#160; But the truth is, what women really need can&amp;#8217;t be found at a pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Kelly Brogan, antidepressants not only overpromise and underdeliver, but their use may permanently disable the body&amp;#8217;s self-healing potential. We need a new paradigm: The best way to heal the mind is to heal the whole body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this groundbreaking, science-based and holistic approach, Dr. Brogan shatters the mythology conventional medicine has built around the causes and treatment of depression. Based on her expert interpretation of published medical findings, combined with years of experience from her clinical practice, Dr. Brogan illuminates the true cause of depression: it is not simply a chemical imbalance, but a lifestyle crisis that demands a reset. It is a signal that the interconnected systems in the body are out of balance &amp;#8211; from blood sugar, to gut health, to thyroid function&amp;#8211; and inflammation is at the root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Mind of Your Own&lt;/em&gt; offers an achievable, step-by-step 30-day action plan&amp;#8212;including powerful dietary interventions, targeted nutrient support, detoxification, sleep, and stress reframing techniques&amp;#8212;women can use to heal their bodies, alleviate inflammation, and feel like themselves again without a single prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bold, brave, and revolutionary, &lt;em&gt;A Mind of Your Own&lt;/em&gt; takes readers on a journey of self-empowerment for radical transformation that goes far beyond symptom relief.&lt;/p&gt;" />
