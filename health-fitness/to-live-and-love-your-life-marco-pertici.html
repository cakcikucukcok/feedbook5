  <title>To Live and Love Your Life - Marco Pertici</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book represents a very exciting part of my personal journey and has been written to better understand our existence on this blue planet. This book has also been written with the desire to share my personal ideas with others and to start a dialogue in the hope of improving our everyday lives.
The three sections of the book all have the same goal which is to define as well as eventually find happiness. The first part of the book explains how to organize your life with the prioritizing process and describes the human needs, wants, and hopes. The second part explains how to maximize flexibility and minimize stress to find happiness, and the third part explains our existence on earth and the rationale behind the meaning of life.
This book obviously represents my personal understanding of life and will hopefully help some individuals who are looking for a refreshing way to look at our brief passage on earth." />
