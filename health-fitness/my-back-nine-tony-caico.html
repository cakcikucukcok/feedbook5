  <title>My Back Nine - Tony Caico</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After riding the gravy train for more than ten years in the mortgage banking industry, author Tony Caicos industry and his life met at an intersection and crashed. His worth was so closely tied to what he did for a living that he no longer knew who he was. After some careful soul searching, his healing began, and he put his life back on track.&lt;p&gt;
Using the back nine holes of a golf course as a guide, Caico uses his experiences to help others analyze what they need to do better to truly enjoy the second half of their lives. Each golf hole represents one of the following nine key life components: family, health and wellness, knowledge, career, spirituality,
leadership, relationships, self-improvement,
and happiness. In &lt;i&gt;My Back Nine&lt;/i&gt;, Caico synthesizes current thinking and research on
careers, evaluating strengths, and formulating life plans to offer a guide to making changes for the better.&lt;p&gt;
The essential qualities needed for success in golfpreparation, focus, patience, discipline, integrity, and honestyare the same qualities
necessary to be successful in life. &lt;i&gt;My Back Nine&lt;/i&gt; shows how both life and sports can often create real winners on and off the playing
field." />
