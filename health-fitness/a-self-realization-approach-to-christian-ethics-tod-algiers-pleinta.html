  <title>A Self-Realization Approach to Christian Ethics - Tod Algiers Pleinta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Self-Realization Approach to Christian Ethics has only two components
of success, self-realization or improvement of self, and Christian ethics or
helping other people improve wherever they are. This is what Christians
know as charity.
The first component or the self-realization approach can be summed
up by Sigmund Freud who warned, death comes not when our hearts
stop beating, but when we stop growing. We are not human beings
growing spiritually. We are spiritual beings in human body. Progressive
personal growth is an eternal self-improvement, the first true component
of success.
If the truest success is but the improvement of self, and if the best form
of self-improvement is virtue, and if virtue is the full use of ones powers
along the lines of excellence, then we understand the arguments conclusion
to follow: the truest form of success is the full use of ones powers along
the lines of excellence.
The direct approach to pursuing happiness, however, does not always
give us the desired results. Usually we find genuine happiness by actively
helping other people be happy. Charity is the highest, noblest, strongest kind
of love, not merely affection. Charity is seeing the pure love of the friend
we have in Jesus Christ, and in other people.
Charity is not just acts of benevolence, although it may be a prompting
motive. Charity is everlasting love. Charity is perfect love. The desire to
serve other people and help them improve wherever they are is the heart
of charity. Those who feel charity help other people out of sincere love,
without expecting something in return. Charity is accomplished by looking
for opportunities to serve others in whatever ways we can. Another way of describing these two components of happiness is: 1)
realization of ones personal potential, and 2) perfecting ones interpersonal
skills to socialize with charity beginning at home. These are the themes
running through the fabric of this bookA Self-Realization Approach to
Christian Ethics." />
