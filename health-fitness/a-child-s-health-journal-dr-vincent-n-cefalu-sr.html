  <title>A Child’S Health Journal - Dr. Vincent N. Cefalu Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a simplified version for the child who must begin looking at life from the real side. I was severely overweight for a very long time, and because of this, there was damage to my blood vessels and heart that will be permanent. So my intention is to warn the extremely young person that healthy eating is absolutely necessary, and the earlier it is started, the better the child will be able to keep the weight down later on in life and avoid its consequences. I present what I consider to be the perfect diet for the youngster to become healthier. It is a sad fact that overweight children are constantly teased by their friends, and they know that losing weight and becoming more attractive is the only answer. 
I explain some reactions that are constantly taking place inside our body so that the child can understand why it can be difficult to lose weight, why we become overweight, how overeating causes type 2 diabetes, and what must be done to prevent these problems. Also, a diabetic would hopefully come to realize that losing weight is the only sure cure. 
Along with this, I remind all my young readers that there are many dangerous things that exist around us, some made by man, such as smoking, radiation, and certain drugs and products, that need to be avoided. I also discuss some accidents that, far too often, cause deaths, and I tell how they can be prevented. Furthermore, I am obligated to emphasize the drug and sex problems since, sooner or later, the child will be finding out the true facts, so I present these in easy-to-understand language. What they are able to learn now will pay off tremendously in the future. The child might even find many of my poems along the way somewhat enjoyable and amusing. 
Regardless of whether you are part of a school system or a parent or guardian, you should be concerned about the many disasters that surround us today, and you would want your child to become better prepared to meet these challenges. On this basis, I offer honest and realistic advice based on my personal and professional experiences." />
