  <title>The Body Book - Cameron Diaz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cameron Diaz shares her formula for becoming happier, healthier, and stronger in this positive, essential guide grounded in science and inspired by personal experience, a #&lt;strong&gt;1&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout her career, Cameron Diaz has been a role model for millions of women. By her own candid admission, though, this fit, glamorous, but down-to-earth star was not always health-conscious. Learning about the inseparable link between nutrition and the body was just one of the life-changing lessons that has fed Cameron&amp;#8217;s hunger to educate herself about the best ways to feed, move, and care for her body. In &lt;em&gt;The Body Book, &lt;/em&gt;she shares what she has learned and continues to discover about nutrition, exercise, and the mind/body connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grounded in science and informed by real life, &lt;em&gt;The Body Book&lt;/em&gt; offers a comprehensive overview of the human body and mind, from the cellular level up. From demystifying and debunking the hype around food groups to explaining the value of vitamins and minerals, readers will discover why it&amp;#8217;s so important to embrace the instinct of hunger and to satisfy it with whole, nutrient-dense foods. Cameron also explains the essential role of movement, the importance of muscle and bone strength and why we need to sweat a little every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Body Book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;does not set goals to reach in seven days or thirty days or a year. It offers a holistic, long-term approach to making consistent choices and reaching the ultimate goal: a long, strong, happy, healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
