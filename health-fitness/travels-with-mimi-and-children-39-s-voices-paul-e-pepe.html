  <title>Travels with Mimi and Children&#39;s Voices - Paul E. Pepe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Our personal journey began fifty years ago when we went to Europe for our honeymoon.
It was a wonderful uplifting experience, and now, fifty years later, having visited more than fifty countries and more tan two hundred and twenty foreign cities, we are still anxious to see more.
We have been to some countries more than once including France, Russia, Spain, Finland, Canada, Poland, Germany and others, but most especially Italy where we have visited more than ten times.
We have seen major wonders of this world, from the Great Wall of China to the Pyramids of Egypt, from Macchu Picchu in Peru to Mt. Fuji in Japan and from the Roman Forum to the Kremlin. We have followed the trail of the Roman Empire from Morocco to Poland to Great Britain and beyond.
Our journey has been long and not without its pitfalls, but it has been a supremely happy one.
And nowwe go on, and hope for another fifty years." />
