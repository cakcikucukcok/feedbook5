  <title>How to Look Hot in a Minivan - Janice Min</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 2003, as the newly named editor in chief of &lt;i&gt;Us Weekly&lt;/i&gt; magazine, Janice Min was busy documenting a seismic cultural shift: the making of the &quot;Hollywood Mom.&quot; Think Angelina Jolie, Victoria Beckham, Halle Berry, and Beyoncé--stars who proudly displayed their pregnancies, shed the baby weight overnight, and helped turn the once-frumpy bump industry into seriously big business. In the blink of an eye, it seemed, &quot;skinny jeans&quot; had replaced &quot;mom jeans.&quot; Bugaboos had become status symbols. Motherhood itself had become an exciting style statement. And then--just eight weeks after her big promotion--Janice discovered that she was pregnant, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I started ogling, with morbid fascination, the photographs that flooded my office--red-carpet and paparazzi shots of celebrities in bikinis and bandage dresses mere weeks after giving birth,&quot; she writes. &quot;I&#39;d stare at my own ever-expanding body. Then I&#39;d stare at Heidi Klum (who gave birth one month before &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;due date and managed to bounce back before I&#39;d even hit the delivery room). How did these women do it? I wondered.&quot; &lt;i&gt;How to Look Hot in a Minivan&lt;/i&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her trademark self-deprecating style and tongue-in-cheek humor, Janice set out to debunk some of Hollywood&#39;s biggest mommy myths. Then she brought together the industry&#39;s biggest experts in fitness, fashion, beauty, and all-things-baby to divulge the secrets behind the stars&#39; seemingly effortless postpartum style. Serving up practical, honest, and often surprising advice for new moms everywhere, Janice and her arsenal of experts reveal: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o The 10 Wardrobe Essentials every chic mom should own&lt;br&gt;o How to style red carpet-worthy hair, even on school days&lt;br&gt;o The secrets to hiding a postnatal stomach pooch&lt;br&gt;o The truth behind the C-tuck (Do celebrity moms sometimes slim down courtesy of a combination cesarean section-tummy tuck?) &lt;br&gt;o Hollywood&#39;s Biggest Losers (What did it &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; take for stars like Kate Hudson, Milla Jovovich, and Poppy Montgomery to lose the baby weight?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;How to Look Hot in a Minivan&lt;/i&gt;, Min dispels the idea that looking great post-pregnancy is only for the rich, the pampered, and the lucky. With Min&#39;s guilt-free, stay-sane strategies, moms everywhere can look and feel like stars--whether their baby is six months or sixteen years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
