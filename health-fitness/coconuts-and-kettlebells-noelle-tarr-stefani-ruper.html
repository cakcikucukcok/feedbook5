  <title>Coconuts and Kettlebells - Noelle Tarr, Stefani Ruper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Created by the expert hosts of the popular &lt;em&gt;Well-Fed Women Podcast&lt;/em&gt;, a step-by-step food and fitness plan for women, that teaches them how to improve their health by changing the quality&amp;#8212;not the quantity&amp;#8212;of the food they eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To eat your way to better health, you don&amp;#8217;t need to limit your calorie intake, or cut out carbs or fat. You don&amp;#8217;t need to count &quot;points.&quot; Better health doesn&amp;#8217;t come from limits. It comes from focusing on the quality of food that you eat&amp;#8212;not the quantity. Instead of limiting your food intake you should be enriching it, argue Noelle Tarr and Stefani Ruper. The popular hosts of the &lt;em&gt;Well-Fed Women Podcast&lt;/em&gt; want you to focus on the good things you eat. They want to make sure you get enough food so that your body has the fuel and nourishment it needs to support a healthy, long, and energetic life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noelle and Stefani know about eating for health firsthand. They, too, struggled with confusing and frustrating medical conditions, including infertility, digestive issues, acne, polycystic ovarian syndrome, hypothyroidism, and anemia. They discovered that the secret to improving wellness was actually more food: they ditched the diet books, calorie counters, and scales, and started eating their way to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Coconuts and Kettlebells&lt;/em&gt;, you&amp;#8217;ll eat at least 2,000 calories a day thanks to a delicious selection of dishes that are all gluten-free, grain-free, and paleo. Within those 2,000 calories, setting a minimum intakes of protein, fat, and carbohydrates instead of the usual maximums will ensure that your diet is full of nutrients, while also providing flexibility to enjoy what you&amp;#8217;re eating. Noelle and Stefani identify the Big Four foods&amp;#8212;grains, dairy, vegetable oils, and refined sugar&amp;#8212;that cause the most health problems among women. While many diets require you to eliminate these foods entirely, &lt;em&gt;Coconuts and Kettlebells&lt;/em&gt; provides an easy-to-follow step-by-step program to test these foods and determine which you need to cut back on&amp;#8212;and which you don&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8212;to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help you discover how your body responds to the Big Four, you&amp;#8217;ll choose from two simple 4-week meal plans: one for the Butter Lover (people who tend to feel more satisfied eating higher ratios of fats) and one for the Bread Lover (people who tend to feel more satisfied eating higher ratios of carbs). Each meal plan comes with a weekly shopping list, a guide to kitchen tools and equipment, and instructions on how to batch cook, meal prep, and stock the pantry. In addition, you&amp;#8217;ll have access to over 75 gluten-free and paleo-friendly flavor-packed recipes (free of the Big Four foods) for every meal of the day, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coconut Chai Latte&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kale and Bacon Breakfast Skillet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple Pie Smoothie&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thai Coconut Curry Shrimp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moroccan Lamb Meatballs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shrimp and Cabbage Stir Fry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parsnip and Carrot Fries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mango Jalapeno Salsa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chocolate Cherry Energy Bites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lemon Raspberry Mini Cheesecakes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To go along with the meal plans, Noelle and Stefani also provide three 4-week fitness plans tailored to three experience levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. All of the workouts can be done anywhere&amp;#8212;at your home or on the road&amp;#8212;and take no more than thirty minutes. A comprehensive whole body program to get and keep you healthy inside and out, &lt;em&gt;Coconuts and Kettlebells&lt;/em&gt; provides the knowledge and tools you need to heal in a way that is effortless, rewarding, confidence-boosting, and everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coconuts and Kettlebells&lt;/em&gt; is illustrated with color photos throughout.&lt;/p&gt;" />
