  <title>The Bliss Balance - Create Success, Peace, and Happiness in Your Life - Rebekah Harkness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are your efforts to perform and over-achieve hindering you from reaching your full potential and experiencing the inner peace and happiness that you long for? Are you mentally fatigued, hopeless, or pessimistic about your ability to create the life you want to live? The Bliss Balance offers a blueprint to create success, peace, and happiness in your life. Regardless of where you are along the journey, this book will assist you in bringing your dreams into reality and provide you the tools to create the necessary balance of observation, contemplation, and taking action.  The Bliss Balance explores the relationship between being a spectator and being a performer in life. In society, we tend to focus more on hastily taking action when we haven&#39;t taken the time to contemplate, observe, and visualize what result we would like to create. This book gives you the opportunity to address this imbalance and develop an equilibrium between observation and action. Ultimately, this balance will create bliss and peace while allowing you to produce the life results you want." />
