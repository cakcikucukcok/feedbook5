  <title>The Five Invitations - Frank Ostaseski, Rachel Naomi M.D. Remen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Death is not waiting for us at the end of a long road. Death is always with us, in the marrow of every passing moment. She is the secret teacher hiding in plain sight, helping us to discover what matters most.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life and death are a package deal. They cannot be pulled apart and we cannot truly live unless we are aware of death. &lt;i&gt;The Five Invitations&lt;/i&gt; is an exhilarating meditation on the meaning of life and how maintaining an ever-present consciousness of death can bring us closer to our truest selves. As a renowned teacher of compassionate caregiving and the cofounder of the Zen Hospice Project, Frank Ostaseski has sat on the precipice of death with more than a thousand people. In &lt;i&gt;The Five Invitations,&lt;/i&gt; he distills the lessons gleaned over the course of his career, offering an evocative and stirring guide that points to a radical path to transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Five Invitations:&lt;br&gt;-Don&#39;t Wait&lt;br&gt;-Welcome Everything, Push Away Nothing&lt;br&gt;-Bring Your Whole Self to the Experience&lt;br&gt;-Find a Place of Rest in the Middle of Things&lt;br&gt;-Cultivate Don&#39;t Know Mind&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These Five Invitations show us how to wake up fully to our lives. They can be understood as best practices for anyone coping with loss or navigating any sort of transition or crisis; they guide us toward appreciating life&#39;s preciousness. Awareness of death can be a valuable companion on the road to living well, forging a rich and meaningful life, and letting go of regret. &lt;i&gt;The Five Invitations&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful and inspiring exploration of the essential wisdom dying has to impart to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
