  <title>Discovering Your Own Doctor Within - Amy E. Coleman, Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;This is an outstanding book, written by an outstanding and courageous physician who is a physician in the best sense of the word - who cares not only for the body but also for the deeper mind and soul. Dr. Coleman&#39;s stories of clinical care are perfect examples of the highest ideals of medicine, and should be read not only by those who wish to understand the deeper roots of their symptoms but also by those who want to better care for their patients. With both clarity and an ear for story-telling, Dr. Coleman illustrates how presenting symptoms are both a mask and a set of clues to the real stressors and urges to growth that lie beneath the surface, and with consummate skill she traces these clues to their source in order to treat causes rather than symptoms.&quot; -Jeffrey D. Rediger, MD, MDiv Harvard Medical School Faculty and Instructor" />
