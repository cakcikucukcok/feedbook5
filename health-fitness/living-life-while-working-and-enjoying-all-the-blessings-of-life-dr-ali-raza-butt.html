  <title>Living Life While Working and Enjoying All the Blessings of Life - Dr. Ali Raza Butt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about life and how to get the best out of life. It reminds us that life is the most beautiful gift of nature and we should make the best out of our life. It educates us on how to maintain the best balance in life to have maximum happiness and satisfaction in life. It tells us that a lot of us focus completely on our work and just sacrifice everything else in life, but we should not forget that despite work as a very important part of our life, it is still a part and not the whole life. 
If we just focus on our work only, it will create imbalance in our life, and our personal life will be full of stress, and as a result, our professional life will also suffer. Balanced life will allow us the luxury to be satisfied and successful in the two most important aspects of our life, personal and professional. The modern cutthroat global competition forces us to forget about really living life full of happiness, and we are just busy in living. 
A balanced life should be in which we value all aspects of our life and not just one aspect and ignore all other things and create an imbalance in our life, affecting not only our own personal life but also the lives of important people around us. Imbalance in life will increase our pressures and stresses, and a balanced life will bring peace of mind and will soothe us and we will be full of energy and motivation. We should be really thankful for all gifts our Creator has gifted us in our life and in the world around us. This beautiful gift of life can be made more beautiful by creating a beautiful balance in our life." />
