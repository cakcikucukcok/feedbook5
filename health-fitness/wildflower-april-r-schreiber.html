  <title>Wildflower - April R. Schreiber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A blind date introduces April to a man she nicknames Jimmer and her life is changed forever. He exposes her to the finer things in life, but more importantly, he teaches her what true love is. She finds herself telling him things she never told anyone before and cannot understand why he loves her when he could have someone not as damaged as she. She is an addict when they meet, had been raped, and had a childhood filled with severe physical and mental abuse. Yet, the more she tells him, the more deeply he falls in love with her.
Coming from a small town where hunting and guns are common place, she thinks nothing of it when she learns he carries a .38 under his suit coat to work. After living on a rough part of a reservation where her sister handed her a rifle because she though someone was coming to steal their gas, she assumes his guns are to protect the large amounts of cash he has both in his car trunk and apartment. She is unfamiliar with city life and assumes this is normal.
Because she trusts him so completely, she is not suspicious of his job when he takes spur of the moment out-of-state business trips that can last for an undetermined amount of time. When he tells her something &#39;fell off a truck&#39; he laughs as she wonders why it didn&#39;t break.
Wildflower is true the story of their time spent together, events that happened, and murder. It is a story every woman of every age can relate to. It is the author&#39;s hope that you enjoy this glimpse of the not-so-average life one woman was lucky enough to survive. 
May you be in heaven half an hour before the devil knows youre dead!" />
