  <title>The Pleasures of Life - Sir John Lubbock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A practical guide to Mindfullness and Happiness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this book, Sir John Lubbock, shares his personal philosophy for living. Topics covered are: the duty of happiness, the blessing of friends, the choice of books, the value of time, the pleasure of travel, ambition, health, the beauties of Nature, labor and rest, the troubles of life, love, the destiny of man,...&lt;br /&gt;
A must-read for everyone trying to excel in a world of increasing workloads, stress, and negativity, &lt;i&gt;The Pleasures of Life&lt;/i&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t only about how to become happier. It&amp;rsquo;s about how to reap the benefits of a happier and more positive mind-set to achieve the extraordinary in our lives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Excerpt : &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;laquo; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Each day is a little life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All other good gifts depend on time for their value. What are friends, books, or health, the interest of travel or the delights of home, if we have not time for their enjoyment? Time is often said to be money, but it is more-it is life; and yet many who would cling desperately to life, think nothing of wasting time.&lt;br /&gt;
Ask of the wise, says Schiller in Lord Sherbrooke&amp;#39;s translation,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;The moments we forego&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Eternity itself cannot retrieve.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
And, in the words of Dante,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;For who knows most, him loss of time most grieves.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Not that a life of drudgery should be our ideal. Far from it. Time spent in innocent and rational enjoyments, in healthy games, in social and family intercourse, is well and wisely spent. Games not only keep the body in health, but give a command over the muscles and limbs which cannot be overvalued. Moreover, there are temptations which strong exercise best enables us to resist.&lt;br /&gt;
It is the idle who complain they cannot find time to do that which they fancy they wish. In truth, people can generally make time for what they choose to do; it is not really the time but the will that is wanting: and the advantage of leisure is mainly that we may have the power of choosing our own work, not certainly that it confers any privilege of idleness. &amp;raquo;" />
