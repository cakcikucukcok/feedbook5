  <title>A Piece of Cake - Roger Kohler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sixty-six-year-old Roger Kohler was heading for a heart attack, and he didnt know it. During an annual exam, he mentioned to his doctor that he was feeling tired after his walks on the beaches of Cape Cod with his wife, Adele, and their golden retriever, Bella. His family practitioner arranged an appointment with a cardiologist, and Kohler received some important news: He needed open-heart surgery, and soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Piece of Cake&lt;/i&gt;, Kohler narrates the story of his experience dealing with heart diseasefrom his initial diagnosis through his heart surgery and his recovery. He shares the details of how he felt before and after the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inspirational story, &lt;i&gt;A Piece of Cake&lt;/i&gt; draws attention to the number one killer today in America, where an estimated 1.1 million will have a heart attack this yearand one-third of them will die. Like Kohler, many never show prior symptoms of heart disease. Kohlers personal experiences provide insight into the impact heart disease has on human lives. &lt;/p&gt;" />
