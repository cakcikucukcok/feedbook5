      <meta name="description" content="It watches waiting for its perfect time to strike.
Evelyn discovers something dark, and it tests her limits. This dark comes from another world. It will make Evelyn question and reveal secrets about a forest and its forgotten history. A town is haunted on the edges of this plain, and in not long, Evelyn will awaken from a bad dream, tracing back the vivid memory to unravel something long lost from a very different era. The forest whispers her very name... Evelyn. But who am I? -- Evelyn asks. And who will she come to face if she is to go in search for answers? To venture the unknown is to rediscover herself. She&#39;ll walk an unknown time with an unraveling soul. She&#39;ll reach, in search for more. Oh, but the answers just keep getting better.
The winds of change are blowing, the time is now... and the echoes of her past are calling... 
Evelyn looks over her shovel at the forest.
...The mystic dawn is waiting
to be found." />
