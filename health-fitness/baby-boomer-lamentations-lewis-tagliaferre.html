  <title>Baby Boomer Lamentations - Lewis Tagliaferre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Baby Boomer Lamentations&lt;/i&gt; is a book of honesty for all seventy-six million baby boomers born from 1946 to 1965. It is not about the health, wealth, and happiness in old age that we see in those sleek magazines about retirement. Instead, this is an exploration of the metaphysics of aging in America, something unpleasant to contemplate but inevitable. The fact is that aging baby boomers and their families who are not prepared for the changes that are coming will have to meet them anyway. So you better have a firm and reliable belief system to handle the impact of this new reality the aging baby boomers now are imposing on the American economy. 
	Author Lewis Tagliaferre brings a lifetime of personal experience from the untimely loss of his wife and the recovery process in his own family to this book. His is a different, contrarian perspective on life that employs many different approaches for attaining human maturity including psychology, religion, science, and anthropology. The result is the development of the five principles of Theofatalism to help baby boomers meet the challenges of aging in America. The principles of Theofatalism were developed from spiritual encounters in Sedona, Arizona. Aging is like walking a labyrinth where there is no choice but to take the pathway that is perhaps provided by God, the almighty One." />
