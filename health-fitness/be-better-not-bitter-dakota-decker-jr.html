  <title>Be Better, Not Bitter - Dakota Decker Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Being thrown into prison (or jail) is a soul-crushing life experience, and any prisoner has one of the two following choices pertaining to how they handle the experiencethey can become bitter, or they can become better. 
The natural choice is to become bittermany times, very, very bitter. Mr. Decker provides the reader his experience and understanding as to the basis of either choice. This is framed as either a fear-based or a love-based choice. This frame applies to both prisoner and nonprisoners alike, including why we incarcerate people in the first place. Using his prison experiences, social science, and many wise peoples quotes, he helps the reader see that if a prisoner or nonprisoner uses only the authors fear-based insights, anyone will naturally become bitter. However, if we all use the authors love-based insights, well become better. Mr. Decker&#39;s insights and wisdom can and should be liberally applied to nonprison environments as his insights apply equally to every person in every walk of life. The reader comes away knowing hes able to withstand any and every one of lifes challenges using love and forgiveness. Mr. Decker demonstrates that love-based thinking is the key to our peace of mind. Each one of us is entitled to and capable of the peace of mind he describes." />
