  <title>From Mum to Mum - Sarra G. Nasser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
The emotional ups and downs of pregnancy can make you feel like you are on a
roller coaster ride! &lt;b&gt;From Mum to Mum&lt;/b&gt; will better prepare you for this and give
you a deeper understanding of why it is you are feeling this way. The book is
written by someone who has been through the whole process of pregnancy, birth
and caring for the newborn. It is written through the eyes of a mother and gives
you all the facts straight.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;From Mum to Mum&lt;/b&gt; provides expectant parents, both first time and &#39;old time&#39;, with
some light-hearted, honest and informative information about what they may be
experiencing during their pregnancy, the birth and the first few months at home
with a newborn baby. The focus being on the emotional changes one may expect and
to ensure the expectant mother that what she is going through is in fact normal.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Preparing the nursery, the clothes and getting all the essential items for the
baby may be quite a daunting task for first-time parents. Walking into a baby
shop, your first instinct is to grab one of everything, not really knowing
whether you really need it or not. If you do need it, how on earth do you use it?
Where are all the shop assistants who are supposed to help? Can I take one home
with me? In order to make the process easier, &lt;b&gt;From Mum to Mum&lt;/b&gt; includes a detailed
list of all items needed as well as an explanation as to how to use each item.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Preparing for the birth and the anxieties of how one is going to cope may be
quite frightening. You&#39;ve heard all the stories, but what is it really like? A
detailed and honest account of what to expect and how you can make it easier for
your self is a major part of &lt;b&gt;From Mum to Mum&lt;/b&gt;. What is it like after the birth?
How may I be feeling? Will I be able to just get up and go? These are all the
points addressed in the book as there is quite a misconception as to the speed
and ease of recovery.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Finally, the section on being at home with the baby is aimed at giving a few
helpful tips on how to cope and what the new mother may be feeling at the time.
It is helpful for fathers to read the book as well, to shed some light on why his
once bubbly, joyous wife is now willing to sleep for hours on end and flies off
the handle at the slightest look, touch, or comment.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;hr width=&quot;70%&quot;&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&quot;The art of writing is a gift that needs drive. It is Sarra&#39;s motivation,
determination, and loving character that have initiated that drive. I have shared
with her and her husband the sadness of miscarriages and the joy of giving birth
to her four lovely children. In a field shared by all mothers, Sarra manages to
cover and address the different aspects of the mystery of motherhood, yet at the
same time brings to light more facts and fresh opinions. She provides a great deal
of worthy and practical advice that will give more confidence and reassurance to
mothers. I find the book enjoyable and stimulating and recommend it heartily,
both for those new to motherhood and for those who are already blessed with it.&quot;

&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&quot;When Sarra asked me to write the forward to &lt;b&gt;From Mum to Mum&lt;/b&gt;, I was pleased and
honoured. In her book, Sarra shares her experience of being a mum with other
mums. This makes the book different from any other book written by professionals
attempting to prepare and educate future mothers. From Mum to Mum is a great
source of information , from which mothers learn about early pregnancy, morning
sickness, heartburn and labour, etc. Sarra also shares the pleasures of preparing
for the arrival of the baby, the onset of labour, and the delivery, as well as
caring for the newborn. The book is for all mothers as it is written in a very
simple, easy to read style. Sarra uses her own personal experience to explain and
clarify scientific words and processes. As the pediatrician of her four
beautiful, healthy children, I have shared with her the many experiences and
events described in this book and I have had a great pleasure reading it.&quot;
