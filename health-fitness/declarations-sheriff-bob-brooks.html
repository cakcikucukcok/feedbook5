  <title>Declarations - Sheriff Bob Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his inspiring book, Bob Brooks, having capped almost four decades in law enforcement with a twelve-year tenure as the elected sheriff of Southern Californias Ventura County, has invited us into the private quarters of his heart to reveal a set of battle-proven guidelines that he kept on his desk, each powerfully verbalized in the language of the apostle Pauls short letter to the early Christians in the city of Philippi. Pauls counsel and Brooks stories of their impact on his leadership style, and his life of service, suddenly seem tailor-made for todays challenges to anyone with huge responsibilities and tough choices that affect the lives of others. Brooks writing style is both commanding and gently encouraging, sympathetic but pulling no punches.  Leaders will find themselves keeping his book nearby to pick up again and againto read and re-readwhen faced by challenges that can wear one to weariness or timid responses just when assurance and clarity are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
