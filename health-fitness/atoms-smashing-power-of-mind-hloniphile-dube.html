  <title>Atoms Smashing Power of Mind - Hloniphile Dube</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote this book, Atoms Smashing Power of Mind, because I feel like the next future leaders of this country, young people, are dying. Theyre dying because of being ignorant and because they are too afraid to step up. Theyre ignorant about their lives, and they tend to give up easily on things that are very important and very beneficial for their future purposes and focus on whatever that will destroy their paths, and they care too much about peoples negative opinions and discriminations. People will always bark, and thats one thing we should keep on reminding ourselves, and that shouldnt stop one from doing certain things. And again theyre too afraid to take an action or actions that would benefit their future purposes. As a result, our country might end up having leaders from other continents or from other countries because we cant simply take good care of our country. By achieving youre not only doing it for yourself but youre doing it for the country because that 1 per cent of change youve made into your life does count. Those who have done economics will understand me better. Let us work hard and hard to uplift our careers, our lives, ourselves, and the economy of our country and above all be daring to be strong and willing to take an action." />
