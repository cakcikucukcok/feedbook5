  <title>The Fattest Guy in the Room - Big Mike Sangiamo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some people say we live in a society that is experiencing an obesity epidemic, a negative health trend that is crippling our country and hurting the future. In The Fattest Guy in the Room, Big Mike Sangiamo turns this topic on its head with an often humorous and occasionally serious account of his life as a thirty-two-year-old overweight man in today&#39;s America. While it may sound like a &quot;scared fit for the fat man&quot; type of book, its real target is society as a whole. Mike&#39;s straightforward and sometimes whimsical observations are brought together with a final life-changing message for everyone who reads this book. No matter who you are, whether youre built like a blimp or Mr. America, you will gain a brand-new perspective on life and on the challenges fat people face in their daily lives. You&#39;ll laugh, you&#39;ll cry, and you&#39;ll laugh some more while reading this groundbreaking take from one of the most talented new authors to hit the literary scene in a while." />
