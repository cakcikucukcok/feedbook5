Its being who you were born to be, helping you to live a more content, happy, and exciting life. There are so many ingredients that make a human being, and through many of them, we tend to lose who we truly are. We can sift through them, separating them by learning to rewire our brains with better thoughts. Just because we go through suffering and pain does not mean we have to live with it in our world. By allowing it to be released, you can begin to see the love in yourself, allowing you to have a fulfilled life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
