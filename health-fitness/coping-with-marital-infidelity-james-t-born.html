His combined investigative experience and training as well as his promise and daily walk with God, can give you the answers you need at this terrible time in your life. There is hope at the end of the tunnel and you can find it in this book. Come with me and explore my secrets of success. This is quite possibly the only book written that can tell you the warning signs of a cheating spouse, how to catch your spouse cheatingand above all, &lt;U&gt;what God has to say about this problem,&lt;/U&gt; all in one organized perspective. You will find both conventional and spiritual guidance that will ease your burden and comfort you in your daily walk through life.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
