  <title>A New Tried and Tested Method to Satisfy your Woman in Bed, Perfect for Men with Small Carrots - Jeff Mike</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most men are unsatisfied with the size of their penis. They think that more is always better. But what is a small penis? Depending on the source, the answer varies a little. For the purposes of this article, we will consider a 6 inch penis as average. Obviously, how far down the scale you are from this benchmark, will determine whether you have a &amp;quot;smaller&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; penis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many surveys have been done where women are asked whether size matters or not. Again the results vary. But there were a few constants. A very small percentage of women (2%), said that they preferred penis sizes above 10 inches. The large majority (above 80%) of women stated that they were satisfied with an average size penis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what do you do if you have a small penis? The first thing is not to despair. Many men will turn into social recluses because of embarrassment and lack of confidence. This is not the right approach. If you have a small penis, learn new skills that will ensure that your lover is fully satisfied. Take heart! Women report that they prefer longer sexual sessions that include massaging, masturbation and oral sex stimulation, as well as penetration. Most men think of sex in a much simpler fashion-penetration. So, learn how to give women what they want and you will be pleasantly surprised that they will be satisfied and come back looking for more.&lt;br /&gt;
