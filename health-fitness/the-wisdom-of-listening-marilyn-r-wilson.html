  <title>The Wisdom of Listening - Marilyn R. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The next time you&amp;rsquo;re out in public, take a moment to look around you. Each and every person you see holds wisdom in their pockets&amp;mdash;pieces of gold they&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated as they walked their own unique life journey.&lt;br /&gt;
Within these pages, Marilyn shares some of the many pieces of gold she has received over her decade-long career. They have been offered to her during interviews, through random encounters and while facing difficult challenges. The most important? We are each unique and exactly who we are meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;
Are you ready to dig for gold? All you need to do is be brave, be present in the moment and be open to the possibilities&amp;mdash;then start a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every life has a story and, no matter our background, we share similar hopes, dreams and fears. This book not only gives you insight into the varied lives of its subjects but, through Marilyn&amp;rsquo;s reflections, shows how we each walk a similar spiritual path.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robbin Whachell, Founder and Editor-in-Chief of &lt;em&gt;The Bahamas Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Marilyn shows us, through her compassionate and incisive interviews, how to grasp and link those golden moments, like sparkling prisms of light, into an animated and profound acceptance of ourselves, the people we encounter, the relationships we build, and the dreams that will set us free.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabriella Contestabile, Author, Founder of Su Misura Sensory Journeys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was reminded we are collectively all walking our own paths, but we often experience similar emotions, feelings, obstacles, challenges, triumphs, rewards, and successes. We each learn as we go and we each become wiser as time passes. This is humanity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RozeMerie Cuevas, Co-Founder and Designer at JAC by Jacqueline Conoir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
