  <title>Connecting Heart with Head - Mushtaq H. Jaafri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, Connecting Heart with Head, speaks about what Soul really is and how  to identify it. How can we attain a quiet mind, or a mind without any thoughts or  no-mind (as it is called in the East) that allows us to accept our Souls which then  allows us to go with the flow  . We remain at peace. We can never control God,  but we can align and flow with His will. We align our Spirit from both sides, the Left-Side and the Right-Side (the two aspect of Spirit). The purpose isnt to talk  about the separation between left and right sides, The Soul is both. When both are  balanced there is perfect equilibrium and accept who we are in reality.
Educationally, the book teaches step-by-step through the fifteen spiritual exercises  that will give you more practical experience of yourself as a Soul and as a one with  God not in theory bur a daily living reality. Among the many book on the market  the author believes that this book is extremely deserving of a place in your heart." />
