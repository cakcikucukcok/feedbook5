      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hidden Epidemic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silent Oral Infections Cause Most Heart Attacks and Breast Cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author:&amp;nbsp;Thomas E. Levy MD, JD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infected teeth, infected gums, infected tonsils, and even infected sinuses always cause enough discomfort to drive us to a physician or dentist, but none of these are life-threatening&amp;hellip; right? Wrong! In fact, dead wrong! They often kill, and they typically do it in a silent fashion. The overwhelming evidence in &lt;em&gt;Hidden Epidemic &lt;/em&gt;proves that these oral infections are responsible for &lt;em&gt;most heart attacks and breast cancers&lt;/em&gt;, as well as a majority of other chronic degenerative diseases. And even more alarming is the fact that when these oral infections are asymptomatic (&amp;ldquo;silent&amp;rdquo;), which is usually the case, they are frequently even more deadly than when they hurt!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New diagnostic tools, such as 3D Cone Beam Imaging, a relatively new diagnostic X-ray tool, reveals many of these pools of infection to a degree never before possible with regular X-ray examinations. Studies with this technology indicate that the prevalence of these oral pathologies is very common throughout the world. The good news is that there are effective treatments for these infections that are very inexpensive &amp;mdash; especially when compared to the costs of treating the degenerative diseases they seed and feed. &lt;em&gt;Hidden Epidemic &lt;/em&gt;is an invaluable resource for lay people, physicians, and dentists who want a clear path away from the pain, suffering, and death associated with silent oral infections.&lt;/p&gt;" />
