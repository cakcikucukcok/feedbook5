      <meta name="description" content="If I asked you to create a list of everything in life that you love where would you place your soul?    Is it at the top, bottom, somewhere in the middle or no entry at all?   Do you know who you really are or how to properly use your gifts and talents?   Are you going to give your soul what it craves or just choose to satisfy your natural appetite?  Deep inside of you resides a person that hungers for something more than this life can ever give.    Every day we make choices and today I want to extend this invitation to all of you that are currently seeking a new direction in your life.   Join me as we discover the path to your purpose because your destiny isnt lost, its just waiting for you to unlock the door.   Make this manual your choice and allow its pages to inspire you. 
My book works from the premise: What the eyes see the mind considers-What the mind considers the heart accepts-What the heart accepts the body does." />
