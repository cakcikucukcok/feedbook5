  <title>Soulmates - Carolyn Godschild Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In her lively and conversational style, Carolyn Miller takes a high-spirited, unsentimental, in-depth look at what a soulmate is and how to connect with that special person. Sharing her own quest and that of dozens of other couples for a meant-to-be relationship, she uses true and extraordinary stories to illustrate what she means by inner guidance.
Contrary to popular belief, soulmate couples do not usually recognize each other at first glance:
When Roma was but eight years old, she risked her life daily by bringing food to Herman, who was interred in a Nazi concentration camp. They later met repeatedly while both lived in Israel, but it was not until nine years later that they met in New York and recognized that they were soulmates.
Karen, a beautiful and successful pop singer, met Pat by handing him her card as she passed him in the street and asking him to &quot;call me.&quot; They became fast friends, but neither felt that they were &quot;right for each other.&quot; It was only after they put aside their preconceived ideas of what their ideal partner would be like that they became soulmates.
Pedro and Elizabeth first met as they passed one another in a psychiatrist&#39;s office. Their therapist felt that they had a past-life connection but ethically could do nothing to bring them together. They met again while waiting for a plane, and discovered they were soulmates.
Each chapter ends with guidelines for actualizing a soulmate relationship, which provide a practical aid to the reader who wishes to find his or her own &quot;relationship made in heaven.&quot;" />
