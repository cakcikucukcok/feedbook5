  <title>Fusion - Eliza Jane Goes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
On one level &lt;b&gt;Fusion&lt;/b&gt; is the story of 94 year old Gloria Hagberg, famous &#39;Granny of the Airlifts&#39; of 1960s Kenya, waiting in the wings while the mixed race son of one of her protgs, Barack Obama, aims for the presidency of the USA.
&lt;p&gt;
On another level the story of ELLA MACKAY begins when she is six in remote 1953 Scotland. EWAN CAMERON inspirational sole teacher of 35 pupils instils a sense of justice and an understanding of human diversity. Ella goes to teach in 1968 Kenya, leaving her family traumatised. She lands in a kaleidoscopic society of multinational idealistic colleagues, earnest African schoolchildren, neo colonials, frightened Asians, religious zealots, corrupt politicians and Pan African Socialists.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ella gets tangled up, via JOHN FRANCIS, nephew of the assassinated Pio Gama Pinto, in a dangerous plan to prevent the assassination of TOM MBOYA popular possible successor to the President. Ella helps to save Mboya&#39;s life then later meets him at the home of GLORIA HAGBERG. A huge secret is uncovered. MIKE KILPATRICK tempts Ella to consider life on a farm in post colonial Kenya. His sister NAN, maimed during Mau Mau, pulls at Ella&#39;s heartstrings. Both Mike and John propose to Ella but she returns to Scotland.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The story moves to 2006/7 with the reflections of an older Ella on how migration has and could contribute to cultural fusion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Meantime Gloria is watching the USA Presidential campaign. If Obama wins it would be more than a triumph for fusion. It would be justice.
