  <title>The Art of Illumination - A.M. Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Art Of Illumination is a spellbinding book that transports one into a world of wonder, mystery, and divine empowerment. It weaves a tale of long lost wisdom and sprinkles it at the feet of the reader like gorgeous pearls. I cannot recommend it highly enough. A fantastic read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Sonia Choquette, NYTimes best-selling author of The Answer Is Simple. Love Yourself. live Your Spirit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Art of Illumination &lt;/i&gt;is the stunning tale of one mans journey into the deepest realm of the soul. A compelling mystery propels this luminous exploration of the human experience of the divine. A wise and beautiful book, it grabbed my heart from the first chapter and never let go. Its a remarkable story, written with startling vision and grace by a promising new author. It will leave you awed, moved and hungering for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Maureen Boyd Biro, author of Walking With Maga and Voices of the Valley, First Press.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is amazing - I picked it up just to check a few lines and couldnt stop reading. I felt as though it was educating me, and I could imagine everything as if I was watching a movie. There wasnt one part of the book which did not make me want to quickly turn to another page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; June Dally Watkins, Education and Training | Business Finishing College.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year is 1097. Britain has been politically unstable for an age, and it doesnt seem as though things will be settling down any time soon. It isnt just political issues that threaten the population, however. Without an understanding of the nature of pestilence or the knowledge of how to treat it, disease runs rampant through the population, affecting everyone in its path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While tragedy rampages unchallenged, one place stands apart from the events afflicting the world at large. Hidden away in a corner of the land stands the large, stone monastery that serves as a shelter from the terrifying world. It is here that one man finds himself on a journey he never expected he would take. He discovers the art of illumination, not only in the creation of beautiful manuscripts, but in illumination of the soul. In the process, he also uncovers a secret that will propel him into a world he never expected to find.&lt;/p&gt;" />
