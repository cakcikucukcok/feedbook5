  <title>Burning Island - Suzanne Goldring</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They were not her children. But she would protect them with her life&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greece 1944.&lt;/strong&gt; Though they don&amp;rsquo;t know it, five-year-old Matilde and three-year-old Anna have kissed their mother for the last time. The Nazis have reached their sun-scorched home, and they are being taken to a place of safety, on the north-eastern tip of the rocky island of Corfu, to be hidden at great risk by kindly Agata and her husband until the terrible war is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matilde and Anna&amp;rsquo;s tears are soothed by Agata&amp;rsquo;s bedtime stories, but she is always alert. So far no soldiers have ventured down the steep rocky hillside to their secret haven, but Agata knows they are constantly scouring the island for missing Jews. And then, on a day when Agata&amp;rsquo;s husband is away, a German soldier appears&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2016&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Under a baking June sun, Amber and her husband arrive in Corfu from England, hoping for a fresh start. But not everyone is pleased by their arrival, and with the pressures of pregnancy, the couple grow further apart. Desperate to find a sense of belonging for herself and her unborn child, Amber finds herself drawn to the local story of two little girls, left by their parents and hidden for their own protection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are some who would rather Amber left Corfu&amp;rsquo;s terrible history well in the past. Can Amber uncover the heart-breaking truth about the two little girls, and what happened after a German soldier took a swim in the bay by their house? If she does, can the secrets of the past help her find happiness, or will they send her running from the island, alone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A gripping, heart-wrenching and compelling read about the shadows at the heart of the sun-drenched island of Corfu and survival against all odds. Fans of Victoria Hislop, &lt;em&gt;The Nightingale&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Tattooist of Auschwitz&lt;/em&gt; will fall in love with &lt;em&gt;Burning Island.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readers are hooked on&lt;em&gt; Burning Island: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Two tragic stories, both equally well told.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;I couldn&#39;t put the book down&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The book will keep you reading until the end.
