  <title>Excellence in Worship - Darrelle R. Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Church musicians&#39; compensation obfuscates many religious people. One commentator of a nationally syndicated religious radio program stated that from all the religious questions, none is as controversial as Should church musicians should be paid? Darrell Alexander resolves the answer through fundamental Bible texts. 
&lt;P&gt;
If you are a church musician, minister of music, soloist, instrumentalist, choir member, church member, trustee, finance committee member, music workshop organizer, teacher, music workshop presenter,  praise team member, interested in becoming a church musician, choir president, organist, pianist, choir director, chorister, church board member, deaconess, pastor, asst. pastor, deacon, professors, a bishop, a priest, a member of the leadership system for your congregation, denomination, and/or any religious organization, students of Theology, Music, Worship and Praise, Sacred Music, or just have a curiosity about whether church musicians should be compensated, then this book is a MUST READ for you! 
&lt;P&gt;
Darrell Alexander, the author, discusses the foundations of the creation of the world, Lucifer and the war in Heaven, the Levites, tithes and offerings, and ways to bridge the gap between ministers, musicians, choir members, administrations, and leadership systems of churches, and religious denominations. How do we differentiate between who is compensated in the church or not compensated?   The author prays that Excellence in Worship: Should Church Musicians Be Paid?, helps to transform any assumptions of ideations, paradigms, and traditions, within churches and denominations and their leaders and members concerning the subject, so that we all may continue to strive for excellence in worship to God. Every church and its members and officials should have a copy in their library &lt;b&gt;Excellence in Worship: Should Church Musicians Be Paid?&lt;/b&gt; is &quot;straight talk&quot; concerning, music, excellence in worship, tithes, offerings, and the church." />
