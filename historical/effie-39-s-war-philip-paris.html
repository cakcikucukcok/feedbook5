  <title>Effie&#39;s War - Philip Paris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 1943, the Scottish Highlands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effie&amp;rsquo;s father has received notice to quit Kirk Farm, their family home. And every other farm and household in the area has had the same instruction. They all have one month to leave, to sell or move their livestock and harvest what they can. For Effie, the upheaval brings her close to Toni &amp;ndash; a handsome Italian POW sent to help out on the farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reverend Walter Smith &amp;ndash; the local minister &amp;ndash; is excited too, but for very different reasons. Handpicked by Hitler before the war and now integrated into British society, he senses that the secret to make the F&amp;uuml;hrer proud is finally within his grasp. Something momentous is underway in this remote corner of the Highlands and he must find out what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That secret is held by Captain Armstrong, newly billeted at Kirk Farm. He&amp;rsquo;s there to scope out places to rehearse the D-Day landings. But when Toni inadvertently passes on information about Operation Overlord, the race is on to block it from Reverend Smith &amp;ndash; and from Hitler himself &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Paris&amp;rsquo;s powerful new novel is based on events of almost 75 years ago, when an entire region of the Highlands was cleared to allow preparations for one of the greatest secrets of the Second World War. Evocative and deeply memorable, it captures the emotions, dangers and atmosphere of those days when the world faced its darkest hour.&lt;/p&gt;" />
