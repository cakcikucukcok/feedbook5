  <title>Unshackled - Michael J Beashel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sydney is booming in 1855 and life looks grand for John Leary: his construction dreams are coming true, his beloved wife Clarissa is expecting their first child and, with his partner Sean Connaire, he has produced some of the city&amp;rsquo;s significant buildings. But success provokes jealousy, and a mysterious rival sabotages a vital Leary site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
John Leary cannot control his own company while his father-in-law holds a majority share, so he arranges a buyout on his own behalf&amp;mdash;but this new, silent partner poses a serious risk to the harmony of his marriage. Meanwhile ex-convict Gerry Gleeson makes himself known to John as his uncle and helps him track down the saboteur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Raw ambition, guilty secrets and undercover deals&amp;mdash;will they bring the young builder to ruin or triumph?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the second novel in The Sandstone Trilogy: a new, magnificent view of nineteenth-century Sydney from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;" />
