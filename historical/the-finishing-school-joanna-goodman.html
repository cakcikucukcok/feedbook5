  <title>The Finishing School - Joanna Goodman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this suspenseful, provocative novel of friendship, secrets, and deceit, a successful writer returns to her elite Swiss boarding school to get to the bottom of a tragic accident that took place while she was a student twenty years earlier.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How far would you go to uncover the truth?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One spring night in 1998 the beautiful Cressida Strauss plunges from a fourth-floor balcony at the Lyc&amp;#233;e Internationale Suisse with catastrophic consequences.

Or was Cressida pushed? It was no secret that she had a selfish streak and had earned as many enemies as allies in her tenure at the school.
