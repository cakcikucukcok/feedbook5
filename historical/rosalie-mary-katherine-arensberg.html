FIVE STARS FOR ROSALIE
Readers Favorite Review June 29, 2010:
If you havent read any of Mary Katherine Arensbergs books, its your loss.  She is a wonderful writer.  Her characters come to life on the pages.  She draws you into their story and you walk beside them.  &quot;Rosalie&quot; is a delightful read.  It reminds parents that we cannot and should not, think for our children.  We must teach and allow them to spread their wings.  They must be able to think for themselves if they are to survive this world we live in.  It is with great honor that I recommend &quot;Rosalie&quot; for your reading pleasure." />
