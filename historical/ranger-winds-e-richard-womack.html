      <meta name="description" content="In this sequel to &lt;i&gt;Ride the Ranger Winds,&lt;/i&gt; the Rangers face death as they try to keep order in an increasingly lawless Texas.
Three of the RangersBoots, Jerry Jack and JoJoarrive in Laredo to settle a range war. A rancher with precious water is fencing off his land, fueling a war that is about to get bloody. But there are also other problems to face  some more welcome than others. Three Fingers and his Indian followers are burning barns, killing babies, and stealing horses; there are settlers with grudges seeking revenge; and Boots is falling in love with Jane Wyatt, a newspaper writer.
The Rangers also face constant temptations to give up their way of life. It will be up to Captain Laughlin, a legendary gunslinger, to figure out whether one of his men may be contributing to the violent disorder.
Step into nineteenth-century Texas and join the Rangers as they contend with marauding Indians, traitorous men, and beautiful women in &lt;i&gt;Ranger Winds: Ride On.&lt;/i&gt;" />
