  <title>Wild Blue Ponders - Max Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Forged in conflict, the United States of America has been at war in one form or another for over two hundred years, and at peace for just seventeen. Within seventy-eight mostly undeclared wars, over a million souls have sadly perished.
In a historical anthology, novelist Max Blue shares forty-nine chapters from his twelve published novels set against the backdrop of Americas wars. Divided into six parts, Blues stories detail diverse battles that include World War I; the economic war of the Great Depression; World War II; the Civil Rights War, Korean War, and Cold War; academic wars; and the ongoing drug wars that still plague America today. His fascinating tales share a glimpse into a time when President Woodrow Wilson reluctantly led his country into a genocidal European war, thousands of World War I veterans desperately sought ways to survive and feed their families, ships were torpedoed in a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, and North Korean troops crossed the thirty-eighth parallel to invade South Korea.
Wild Blue Ponders shares a diverse collection of short tales extracted from the works of an American novelist that detail the effects and aftermath of war through the eyes of fictional characters." />
