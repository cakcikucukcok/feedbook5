  <title>The Reluctant Midwife - Patricia Harman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Midwife of Hope River &lt;/em&gt;returns with a heartfelt sequel, a novel teeming with life and full of humor and warmth, one that celebrates the human spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Great Depression has hit West Virginia hard. Men are out of work; women struggle to feed hungry children. Luckily, Nurse Becky Myers has returned to care for them. While she can handle most situations, Becky is still uneasy helping women deliver their babies. For these mothers-to-be, she relies on an experienced midwife, her dear friend Patience Murphy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though she is happy to be back in Hope River, time and experience have tempered Becky&amp;#8217;s cheerfulness-as tragedy has destroyed the vibrant spirit of her former employer Dr Isaac Blum, who has accompanied her. Patience too has changed. Married and expecting a baby herself, she is relying on Becky to keep the mothers of Hope River safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But becoming a midwife and ushering precious new life into the world is not Becky&amp;#8217;s only challenge. Her skills and courage will be tested when a calamitous forest fire blazes through a Civilian Conservation Corps camp. And she must find a way to bring Isaac back to life and rediscover the hope they both need to go on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full of humor and compassion, &lt;em&gt;The Reluctant Midwife &lt;/em&gt;is a moving tribute to the power of optimism and love to overcome the most trying circumstances and times, and is sure to please fans of the poignant&lt;em&gt; Call the Midwife &lt;/em&gt;series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
