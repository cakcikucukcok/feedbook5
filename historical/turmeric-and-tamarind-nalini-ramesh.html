  <title>Turmeric and Tamarind - Nalini Ramesh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the turn of the nineteenth century in British India, rural communities across the country found themselves at the crossroads. The only way to preserve some sense of their own identity was to merge their culture and language with those of their foreign rulers. It is against this backdrop that the events in Turmeric and Tamarind take place. 
It is the story of a highborn woman who yearns for love but is trapped within a loveless marriage. Abducted by a gypsy, she falls in love with him. Their affair has far-reaching consequences not just for them but also for those they hold most dear. 
On a different level, Turmeric and Tamarind is about social divisions of the time and about men and women who dared to transcend them. It is a tale of love, betrayal, and ultimately, redemption." />
