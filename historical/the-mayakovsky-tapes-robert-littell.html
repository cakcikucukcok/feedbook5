  <title>The Mayakovsky Tapes - Robert Littell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In March 1953, four women meet in Room 408 of Moscow&#39;s deluxe Hotel Metropol. They have gathered to reminisce about Vladimir Mayakovsky, the poet who in death had become a national idol of Soviet Russia. In life, however, he was a much more complicated figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ladies, each of whom could claim to have been a muse to the poet, loved or loathed Mayakovsky in the course of his life, and as they piece together their conflicting memories of him, a portrait of the artist as a young idealist emerges. From his early years as a leader of the Futurist movement to his work as a propagandist for the Revolution and on to the censorship battles that turned him against the state (and, more ominously, the state against him), their recollections reveal Mayakovsky as a passionate, complex, sexually obsessed creature trapped in the epicenter of history, struggling to hold onto his ideals in the face of a revolution betrayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by Robert Littell, whom &lt;i&gt;The &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Washington Post &lt;/i&gt;called &quot;one of the most talented, most original voices in American fiction today, period,&quot; &lt;i&gt;The Mayakovsky Tapes&lt;/i&gt; is an ambitious, impressive novel that brings to life the tumultuous Stalinist era and the predicament of the artists ensnared in it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
