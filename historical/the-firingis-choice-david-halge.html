  <title>The Firingis Choice - David Halge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is nothing more soul destroying than rejection by those who gave birth to you and your people.
Set in 19th Century India, two families, the Stirlings and Van der Wats, descendants of mixed marriages, face discrimination and betrayal at the hands of the English East India Company who introduce reforms that reduce them to the status of second class citizens.  But they continue to answer the call of the blood, fighting and dying for the Company in its conquest of the sub-continent.
1804: Against the backdrop of the struggle for domination of the sub-continent, the Stirlings attempt to circumvent the reforms, but it comes at a high cost with brother fighting against brother. While the Van der Wats turn their backs on the Honorable Company.
1857: During the bloody first war of independence - the Sepoy Mutiny - the Stirlings and Van der Wats struggle for recognition and self-determination comes at a high personal and professional cost.
Through these turbulent times the two families share a common bond with the oppressed and the oppressor, but are shunned by both who continue to use them for their political ambitions." />
