  <title>Hedwig and Berti - Frieda Arkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thirty-five years after publication of her first novel, &lt;i&gt;The Dorp&lt;/i&gt; (followed by other works on cooking and gardening), Frieda Arkin returns to the world of fiction to give us another darkly humorous novel, &lt;i&gt;Hedwig and Berti.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hedwig and Berti&lt;/i&gt; is a saga of the totally unlikely marriage of a grandly Teutonic woman, Hedwig Kessler, and her diminutive cousin Berti, two upper-class German Jews forced to leave their homeland during the rise of the Nazis.  They flee to London, then to New York City, and from there, finally, to a university town in Kansas.  In London, Hedwig gives birth to a daughter whose broodingly dark construction and immense genius for the piano point back in time to the tragedy of her bloodline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a story of prejudice taken to extremes, both within the domain of a severely class-conscious German-Jewish family and beyond it.  The characters are subtle, and finely-honed, and their story is told with grace and unexpected humor.  Like Penelope Fitzgerald, Frieda Arkin possesses a rare gift for combining love, wit, and dark realism in the reactions and behavior of her characters in the several cultures they are forced to adapt to.&lt;/p&gt;" />
