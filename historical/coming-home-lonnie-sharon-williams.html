  <title>Coming Home - Lonnie-Sharon Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Coming Home is a book that fictionally completes the stories of two men in the Bible. The first gives insight into Jesus parable of what we know as the Prodigal (or Lost) Son, explaining the thoughts of the son, his brother, and his father in Luke 15:1132. Jesus begins this parable with the words, A certain man had two sons. The main character is Jakobi, and I have added information into the lives of his entire family. This parable could have been about someones family in the crowd of listeners in Jericho. Jesus wanted the listeners to finish the parable in their own way, so this story was left unfinished. I developed an ending regarding the two sons, the feelings of the parents, an explanation as to why the younger son left home and later returned, and the feelings of the elder son. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second story, Bartimaeus, concerns the healing of a blind man in Mark 10:4652. The Bible does not give this mans age, but allows us to understand that he once had sight. Many of the healed biblical figures were not always named, yet we read he is the son of Timaeus. When Jesus asked what he wanted from Him, he responded that he wanted to regain his sight. How did he become blind in the first place, and what happened after Jesus healed him? &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pray youll enjoy Coming Home, as I tried to finish their stories and future lives following their return home.
The author uses her creative imagination to fill in the missing information of several Bible stories, without violating the integrity of the stories. As a pastor, I recommend this book to all.
