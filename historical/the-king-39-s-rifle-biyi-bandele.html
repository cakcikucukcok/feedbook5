  <title>The King&#39;s Rifle - Biyi Bandele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s winter 1944 and the Second World War is entering its most crucial state. A few months ago fourteen-year-old Ali Banana was a blacksmith&#39;s apprentice in his rural hometown in West Africa; now he&#39;s trekking through the Burmese jungle. Led by the unforgettably charismatic Sergeant Damisa, the unit has been given orders to go behind enemy lines and wreak havoc. But Japanese snipers lurk behind every tree&amp;#8212;and even if the unit manages to escape, infection and disease lie in wait. Homesick and weary, the men of D-Section Thunder Brigade refuse to give up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taut and immediate, &lt;em&gt;The King&#39;s Rifle&lt;/em&gt; is the first novel to depict the experiences of black African soldiers in the Second World War. This is a story of real life battles, of the men who made the legend of the Chindits, the unconventional, quick-strike division of the British Army in India. Brilliantly executed, this vividly realized account details the madness, sacrifice, and dark humor of that war&#39;s most vicious battleground. It is also the moving story of a boy trying to live long enough to become a man.&lt;/p&gt;" />
