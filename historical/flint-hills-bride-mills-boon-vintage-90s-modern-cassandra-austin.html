        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;d Been The Tomboy Heiress And He, The Hired Hand Now things were a little different. He was Jake Rawlings, dedicated lawman, and she was Emily Prescott, woman on the run. But all Jake wanted was to get her to trust him enough to run straight into his waiting arms.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Emily had never been denied anything by her family, until now. And if the man they were trying to keep her away from was the man she really wanted to marry, how come Jake was looking better all the time?&lt;/p&gt;
