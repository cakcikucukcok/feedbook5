  <title>Handmaidens of Rock - Linda Gould</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is the late 1960s, and Jimi Hendrix is at the height of his career, America is undergoing political and social upheaval, and a rock and roll band is shaking the rafters of its suburban Maryland high school. As Preston, the founder and lead guitarist of Homegrown cranks out the tunes with keyboardist, Neal, and drummer, Brad, three girls appoint themselves as the bands official groupies without any idea of what lies ahead for any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the band members sign with a management company and make the controversial decision to replace popular Brad with another drummer, they decide to pursue a dubious lead in England, accompanied by the girls who love them: Candy, an aspiring journalist; Hope, wannabe model and fashion designer; and Theda, a thespian with big dreams. As their journey takes them to Europe and back again, the girlschallenged by love rivals, partying lifestyles, and the growing stardom of the musiciansremain determined not to be mere handmaidens of rock. But it is not until Brad embarks on a vengeful quest at a festival that the three finally have the opportunity to prove their worth as grown women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Handmaidens of Rock&lt;/i&gt; is the compelling tale of three high-school girls who attach themselves to a rock and roll band in the late 1960s and embark on a wild adventure across the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
