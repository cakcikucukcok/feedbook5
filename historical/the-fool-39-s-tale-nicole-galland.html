  <title>The Fool&#39;s Tale - Nicole Galland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wales, 1198. A time of treachery, passion, and uncertainty. King Maelgwyn ap Cadwallon, known as Noble, struggles to protect his small kingdom from foes outside and inside his borders. Pressured into a marriage of political convenience, he takes as his bride the young, headstrong Isabel Mortimer, niece of his powerful English nemesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through strength of character, Isabel wins her husband&#39;s grudging respect, but finds the Welsh court backward and barbaric, and is soon engaged in a battle of wills against Gwirion, the king&#39;s oldest, oddest, and most trusted friend. Before long, however, Gwirion and Isabel&#39;s mutual animosity is abruptly transformed, and the king finds himself as threatened by loved ones as by the enemies who menace his crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A masterful novel by a gifted storyteller, &lt;em&gt;The Fool&#39;s Tale&lt;/em&gt; combines vivid historical fiction, compelling political intrigue, and passionate romance to create an intimate drama of three individuals bound -- and undone -- by love and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
