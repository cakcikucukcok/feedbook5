As she matures from a girl of rare intelligence into an exceptional mathematician, traveling to Europe to further her studies,&amp;#160;she must face the most human of problems&amp;#8212;who is she?

Forced to confront some of the most consequential events of the twentieth century and rethink everything she knows of herself, she finds kinship in the stories of the women who came before her, and discovers how seemingly distant stories, lives, and ideas are inextricably linked to her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tenth Muse &lt;/em&gt;is&amp;#160;a gorgeous, sweeping tale about legacy, identity, and the beautiful ways the mind can make us free.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
