&quot;A live coal.&quot; Sandra McRae; author, poet. &quot;Ive started many a book, put them down and never finished them.  Yours was read in two days - think that says something, especially since Im opposed to most (or is it all) of what Joe believes in.&quot; Judy Mangers. &quot;A GREAT read, Mark... It caught me emotionally--POW--always a sign of
&gt;&gt; excellent writing.&quot; JoAnn Ray; feminist, university professor. &quot;...the scenes with Bobbie and the relationship between Joe and his father -- particularly the memories of abuse -- how those scenes were done -- WOW WAS I IMPRESSED!!!!!!&quot; Mary Collopy Southworth; Educator. &quot;I read Attachment in two days. I enjoyed it. A good book.&quot; John Dicke; Psychologist. &quot;this is one smart beautiful book.&quot; Murray Moulding; poet.
