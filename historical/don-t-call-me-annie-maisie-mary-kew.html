  <title>Don’T Call Me Annie! - Maisie Mary Kew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="1810 Port Jackson was an unlikely time and place for Ann Cotterell to find happiness and fulfilment, but for a lonely young woman in Georgian London whose prospects were grim, this destination seemed to offer a far better future. With a spot of devious scheming, feisty Ann became the eager recipient of a seven year sentence to Englands latest penal colony in New South Wales. Ever the optimist, the impetuous Ann launched herself into a new life that actually promised much more than she hoped for. However, broken dreams and Anns wilfulness again brought her undone. When she found herself in the stocks for a humiliating offence, she discovered Gods grace and mercy were sufficient for even a recalcitrant like herself. But, would she ever find peace and contentment with Will Davis, the hardworking love of her life, and also a former guest of His Majesty?" />
