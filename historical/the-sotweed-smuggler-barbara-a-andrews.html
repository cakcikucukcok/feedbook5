  <title>The Sotweed Smuggler - Barbara A. Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Sotweed Smuggler, the 2010 historical fiction winner of the Houston Writers Guild, tells a story of suspense. Will Sherewell, the son of a prosperous merchant marine captain, learns when his fathers will is read, that he has inherited his ship. Living with his pious mother, he has little knowledge of sailing and anticipates a majestic vessel. Instead, he finds The Emperors Dictum aka The Kings Dick, notorious for smuggling sotweed and whiskey between Devonshire and Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will yearns to be like his father and sails the Dick, enduring ridicule, fierce storms, pirate attacks, and curses of legendary fairies and ghosts, while finding companionship with his runaway brother and discovering the woman he wishes to marry. In spite of his fathers spying, treachery, murder, and Scottish border intrigue, Will learns he served Scotland with honor defeating the outlaw MacGregor Clan. With the new knowledge, he believes his father is their captive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He receives a Scottish certificate with a handwritten notation dead. Did he at last find the truth? Will must choose to accept the veracity of the document, or launch a futile one-man attack on a MacGregor stronghold. Reluctantly accepting his fathers death, he sails home to his new wife at Mothercombe Bay.&lt;/p&gt;" />
