  <title>The Pinch - Steve Stern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A dazzling, spellbinding novel set in a mythical Jewish community by the acclaimed author of the&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Notable Book &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Book of Mischief&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s the late 1960s. The Pinch, once a thriving Jewish community centered on North Main Street in Memphis, has been reduced to a single tenant. Lenny Sklarew awaits the draft by peddling drugs and shelving books--until he learns he is a character in a book about the rise and fall of this very Pinch. Muni Pinsker, who authored the book in an enchanted day containing years, arrived in the neighborhood at its height and was smitten by an alluring tightrope walker. Muni&#39;s own story is dovetailed by that of his uncle Pinchas Pin, whose epic journey to North Main Street forms the book&#39;s spine. Steve Stern interweaves these tales with an ingenious structure that merges past with present, and his wildly inventive fabulism surpasses everything he&#39;s done before. Together, these intersecting stories transform the real-world experience of Lenny, whose fate determines the future of the Pinch, in this brilliant, unforgettable novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
