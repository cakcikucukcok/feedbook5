  <title>Cool Wind&#39;s Gate - Wayne A. Bernard Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about people whose ancestors lived in bondage and the ordeal and challenges facing them finding freedom in a world where others were still in bondage. It tells of the simple life challenges and the struggle of being accepted. It tells of those that were not resposible for the things that were done in the past but were willing to sacrifice everything to make the world they now live in better. It displays the simple beauty that life can hold and the courage to keep that beauty alive. It tells of how their leaders built a challenging world around them and proved to them they were equal to any man. This story contains hardships, challenges, humor and a zest for life as free as it possibly could be. The story takes place in the mid 1800s on a Louisiana cane Plantation. It tells of free people and the challenges they faced to hold that freedom as it was at a time and place in history that just wasnt ready for the change. It tells of the struggles and the pleasures that evolve through the good deeds of a group of people that had the belief that the best people in the world were treated the worst. To see the beauty of the outcome of this story, just take a stroll to the place called Cool Winds Gate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
