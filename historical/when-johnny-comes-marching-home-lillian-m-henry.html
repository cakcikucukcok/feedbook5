  <title>&quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; - Lillian M. Henry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stepping ashore in 1635 at Boston Harbor from the ship Plain Joan, William Hickok begins this saga of the Hickok family in America. Two hundred and twenty-six years later, his descendants are embroiled in what comes to be known as the War Between the States or, more simply, the Civil War. 
Asa Hickok and his brothers, along with their neighbors, answer the call to arms, and this story follows their journey, as well as that of the rest of their families, as all attempt to adjust to the turmoil of changing times. 
Come and march with the men through the hills and valleys. Wait with the wives and mothers as they keep the home fires burning.

Read on and find out what happened when Johnny came marching home." />
