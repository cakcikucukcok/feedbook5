  <title>The Federalist Manifesto of 2163 Ad - Paul R. Hanks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the year 2163 AD. It has been 144 years since the 2019 collapse of the government of the United States of America. In the aftermath of that collapse, several regional governments were organised across the North American continent. Now, in the seventh decade of the twenty-second century, the various North American governments are being invited to unite in a new coast-to-coast federation, known as The Federal Union of Independent North American States, (the FUINAS), under a constitution in many ways similar to the United States Constitution of 1789. These governments, however, in order to help keep the FUINAS from suffering a fate similar as that of the United States of America, want certain guarantees that werent in the original US Constitution written into the FUINAS Constitution. These guarantees, known as the Fourteen Principles of Federalism, an analysis of each of them, and the justification for their inclusion in the FUINAS Constitution, are the subject of The Federalist Manifesto of 2163 AD.&lt;/p&gt;" />
