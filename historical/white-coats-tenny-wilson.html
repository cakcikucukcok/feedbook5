  <title>White Coats - Tenny Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After her husband commits her to a mental institution in the 1930s, Wilma Cooke gives birth to her fourth child. She is not allowed to see the baby. But her doctor, a kindly man named Dr. John Stewart, has no children of his own and decides to secretly adopt the boy. He names him Brandon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the years pass, Brandon grows to be a strong, intelligent young man. He enters medical school in Chicago, and sometimes helps his father at the mental institution. It is there that he realizes Wilma is his real mother. He starts asking his father questions and learns that he has two brothers and a sister. For Brandon, meeting them becomes one of the most important quests of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Brandon finds his now-grown siblings, hes jubilant and plans to have a reunion along with Wilma. There are tough questions about his real father that Brandon still wants answered. But he has medical school to get through and he doesnt need any distractions. Should he open the door to the past or leave well enough alone?&lt;/p&gt;" />
