  <title>Boys of Summer - Lucien N. Plante</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the Darkness, Mike slid over the side of the ship and in to the water, without knowing direction swam away from the ship into the darkness hoping not to hear the sound of a rifle or the pain of its report. Without knowing where he was Mike hoped he was swimming for shore, hoping he would not end up as fish food. He had escaped the Yankees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story of how our Country grew and how we grow. A story of hard work, hard thinking and true love. Some time before the Civil War two families grow together and become part the that eras American dream. The book will show them loving living and celebrating. It will also show the sadness of separation and death. The unforgettable pain of not knowing where someone is or what happened to them. But worst the wrenching pain of not being able to help someone you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witness the lives of two families become one. Witness the boys of summer, sun and youth enter the turbulence of lives winter. No not that they should grow old in years. Life has a winter for all and for some it comes early and is brutal. Hope is down the road we know or least wise believe there will be spring. The sun will warm us and all will be well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
