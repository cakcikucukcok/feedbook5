  <title>The Last Painting of Sara de Vos - Dominic Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Written in prose so clear that we absorb its images as if by mind meld, &quot;The Last Painting&quot; is gorgeous storytelling: wry, playful, and utterly alive, with an almost tactile awareness of the emotional contours of the human heart. Vividly detailed, acutely sensitive to stratifications of gender and class, it&#39;s fiction that keeps you up at night -- first because you&#39;re barreling through the book, then because you&#39;ve slowed your pace to a crawl, savoring the suspense.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A New York Times Book Review Editor&#39;s Choice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A RARE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY PAINTING LINKS THREE LIVES, ON THREE CONTINENTS, OVER THREE CENTURIES IN &lt;i&gt;THE LAST PAINTING OF SARA DE VOS&lt;/i&gt;, AN EXHILARATING NEW NOVEL FROM DOMINIC SMITH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam, 1631: Sara de Vos becomes the first woman to be admitted as a master painter to the city&#39;s Guild of St. Luke. Though women do not paint landscapes (they are generally restricted to indoor subjects), a wintry outdoor scene haunts Sara: She cannot shake the image of a young girl from a nearby village, standing alone beside a silver birch at dusk, staring out at a group of skaters on the frozen river below. Defying the expectations of her time, she decides to paint it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City, 1957: The only known surviving work of Sara de Vos, &lt;i&gt;At the Edge of a Wood&lt;/i&gt;, hangs in the bedroom of a wealthy Manhattan lawyer, Marty de Groot, a descendant of the original owner. It is a beautiful but comfortless landscape. The lawyer&#39;s marriage is prominent but comfortless, too. When a struggling art history grad student, Ellie Shipley, agrees to forge the painting for a dubious art dealer, she finds herself entangled with its owner in ways no one could predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sydney, 2000: Now a celebrated art historian and curator, Ellie Shipley is mounting an exhibition in her field of specialization: female painters of the Dutch Golden Age. When it becomes apparent that both the original At the Edge of a Wood and her forgery are en route to her museum, the life she has carefully constructed threatens to unravel entirely and irrevocably.&lt;/p&gt;" />
