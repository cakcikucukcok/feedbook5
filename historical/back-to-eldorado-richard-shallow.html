  <title>Back to Eldorado - Richard Shallow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a fast-paced story about the fabled Inca city of gold that has been lost somewhere deep in the Amazon jungles of Peru for five hundred years. Against his better judgement, Dr. Fred Myers returns to that green hell called the Amazon jungle. But, this time, he brings twelve men with him to assist him as they encounter the perils of the Amazon, which include six-foot electric eels that can render a horse paralyzed; vampire bats that attack without provocation; flesh-eating fish; large swarms of bugs attacking them every night as they swarm over the campsites, biting and stinging; and thousands of flies laying their larva in their open wounds. They have a run-in with cannibals and headhunters deep within the Amazon and even encounter treachery within their own group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold! Gold! Down through the ages, the search for lost gold treasures has motivated men to endure despicable dangers and hardships to discover riches beyond their wildest dreams. The two hundred Spanish conquistadors conquered ten million Incas and became rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been many pirates that have buried their treasures such as Captain Morgan, who buried his treasure somewhere along the coast of Panama; Captain Kidd, who buried his treasure somewhere along the coast of Virginia; the Beale treasure, said to be worth 45 million dollars; several Spanish galleons carrying millions in gold and silver back to Spain from the Incas and the Aztecs that got caught up in hurricanes and were sunk somewhere in the Caribbean; the lost Dutchman gold mine in Arizona; lost Nazi gold of World War II; the California gold rush; and the Alaska gold rush, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Indiana Jones-type of adventure brings to light many unanswered questions about how the Incas first arrived in Peru. Where did the white-skinned people from the mountainous regions of Northern Peru migrate from? Could they be the lost tribes of Juda? Come with me now as our heroes once more attempt to destroy the aliens, once and for all, before they destroy earth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
