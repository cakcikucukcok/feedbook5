  <title>A Dublin Student Doctor - Patrick Taylor</title>

Now Taylor turns back the clock to give us a portrait of the young Fingal--and show us the pivotal events that shaped the man he would become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1930s, fresh from a stint in the Royal Navy Reserve, and against the wishes of his disapproving father, Fingal O&#39;Reilly goes to Dublin to study medicine. Fingal and his fellow aspiring doctors face the arduous demands of Trinity College and Sir Patrick Dun&#39;s Hospital. The hours are long and the cases challenging, but Fingal manages to find time to box and play rugby--and to romance a fetching, gray-eyed nurse named Kitty O&#39;Hallorhan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dublin is a city of slums and tenements, where brutal poverty breeds diseases that the limited medical knowledge of the time is often ill-equipped to handle.
