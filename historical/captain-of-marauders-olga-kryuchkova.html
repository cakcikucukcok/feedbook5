  <title>Captain Of Marauders - Olga Kryuchkova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Baron Charles de Castelmar, Gasconian nobleman, leaves the war-torn castle and goes to Burgundy to join the mercenaries of the Duke Philip the Good. The fate hurls him and a certain Valeri Sconci, a secret agent of the Vatican, together.&lt;br/&gt;
The war between France and England spikes with renewed vigor. Burgundian mercenaries take the side of the British.  At the critical for France time, Jeanne Lassoux-Roma from Lorraine appears. She convinced that she was sent down by God, in order to unite the French and destroy the English. She goes to Chignon to the Dauphin.&lt;br/&gt;
Charles VII hits on the idea that his sister Baroness Jeanne d&#39;Arc can cope with the role of the Virgin of prophecy. The French gained a number of victories. Jeanne d&#39;Arc, elated by success, with a small knot made a daring attack. They were taken captive by Burgundians, who were led by captain de Castelmar.&lt;br/&gt;
Valeri Sconci convinces the captain of the mercenaries to make a substitution, so that the twin of the Virgin, the peasant Jeanne Lassoux-Roma from Lorraine, who was destined to ascend the bonfire, comes to the hand of the English.&lt;br/&gt;
