For starters he must appoint a Cabinet, open communications with Washington and Europe, find a means to fund his treasury, purchase arms and ammunition, and create an army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	To make matters more difficult, Davis&#39; sphinx-like demeanor in the face of criticisma stony faade that attempts to conceal his broiling emotions, often causing him to hold a grudge or stubbornly support a friendtends to antagonize his old enemies and create new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	However, he does manage to gain some allies. Judah Benjamin, his Attorney General, who, in spite of his attraction to the First Lady, says about the President, &quot;I would follow him to Hell.&quot; Mary Chestnut, who initially befriends Varina Davis to further her husband&#39;s career, develops a warm relationship with the First Family. Mallory, the Secretary of Navy, and Reagon, the Postmaster General, will remain with him until the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	When Varina travels to Montgomery, Alabama, she takes with her, along with her other slaves, Rachel, who, as a result, is separated from her boyfriend, Silas. The servant girl had told Silas that she wouldn&#39;t be forced to leave if he married her, but the boy still clung to he dream of escaping to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Once away from Davis&#39; plantation, Rachel becomes involved with Colonel Chestnut&#39;s body servant, Lawrence, unaware that the handsome slave has become ensnared in the network of spies surrounding the First Family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	All of these peoplepoliticians, soldiers, slaves, and spiesare bound together willy-nilly in an enterprise that will explode at Manassas Junction, ripping their country apart and changing their lives forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
