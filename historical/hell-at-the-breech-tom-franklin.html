  <title>Hell at the Breech - Tom Franklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1897, an aspiring politician is mysteriously murdered in the rural area of Alabama known as Mitcham Beat.

The hooded members wage a bloody year-long campaign of terror that culminates in a massacre where the innocent suffer alongside the guilty. Caught in the maelstrom of the Mitcham war are four people: the aging sheriff sympathetic to both sides; the widowed midwife who delivered nearly every member of Hell-at-the-Breech; a ruthless detective who wages his own war against the gang; and a young store clerk who harbors a terrible secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on incidents that occurred a few miles from the author&#39;s childhood home, &lt;em&gt;Hell at the Breech&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the events of dark days that led the people involved to discover their capacity for good, evil, or for both.&lt;/p&gt;" />
