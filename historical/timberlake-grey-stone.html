  <title>Timberlake - Grey Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Timberlake, provides the reader with an insight to mid-America during the depression days, when folks in all walks of life were struggling to make ends meet. He takes us back from 1934 to 1942, a special time in the annals of American history and depicts a time when lives were shaped, molded, and tempered forever.
Clint Timberlake experienced it all, from the silver mining camps in Colorado to the beaches of Guadalcanal, via the oilfields of Texas. Seems as though there were good times and bad times along the way. It was good times when he was sharing with Jan Paluski, a Texas beauty. Then came the bad times, when he had to deal with the Boysout of Chicago. Clints dad, Harvey, had gained $126,000 in one setting while playing poker in Chicago. A big problem developed when the Boys thought they had been cheated, thereby causing enragement. This lead to brutalities, rape, and murder.
A never-ending love story develops when Clint meets the beautiful, Irene Pendleton, a sophisticated widow from the Hamptons on Long Island, New York. All would be well if the Boys would just forget about the money, but it was not to be.
The men who worked with Timberlake knew him as a mans man. The ladies knew him as a handsome gentleman. The Boys knew him as Hell on Wheels and found them well greased!" />
