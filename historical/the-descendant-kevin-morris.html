      <meta name="description" content="John and Eleanor take over the tenancy of The Old Coaching Inn (The Coach) situated in the Pendle area of Lancashire intending to renovating the third floor attic to provide bed and breakfast accommodation.
There is a legend that The Coach is haunted by a ghost Henry. At first things run smoothly, but eventually more unexplained things start to occur which cannot be attributed solely to Henry. In London, Paul Mitch Mitchell who is a close acquaintance of Jennifer, Eleanors best friend, is having dreams of events which took place long ago. Each dream becomes more vivid and revealing.
Jennifer decides to investigate. She enlists the help of Jake, one of her colleagues at London University. And Jakes wife Annabel who is a spirit medium experienced in the paranormal. With the help of Lucy a research assistant at the University, they come to the rescue. Annabel conducts one-to-one psychic readings and sances to find out what is troubling the spirit. Will it ever be appeased? And, if so how? The answer lies with The Descendant, but, who is it?" />
