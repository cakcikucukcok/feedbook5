  <title>Saving Skunk - Richard R. Roach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the cold wind whistles through a tiny reservation shack, an Ojibwa Indian girl watches as her drunken father staggers and throws a box containing her birthday cake on the table. A few minutes later, he drives away, leaving her alone to celebrate eighteen years of life. As she nibbles the cake and feels the sweetness quickly sour in her stomach, Heidi Barton has no idea that in less than twenty-four hours her father will be dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her fathers body is found, Heidi is wracked with guilt that she was not able to save him from his alcohol abuse. Determined to carry out her dream of becoming a native healer, Heidi summons the strength to begin a challenging initiation process that requires great humility and tenacity. After she is left on an island without food for five days, her mentor finally appears and leads Heidi to a cleansing ceremony where she sits among the Mide council, divulges her incredible vision, and learns of a sacred secret that will change her life forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saving Skunk shares the compelling tale of a girl who embarks on a journey of healing and ultimately discovers her true destiny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
