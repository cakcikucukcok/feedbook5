  <title>A Man Named Job and the Navahos - Luther Butler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The Civil War was raging. In March of 1862 Brigadier General Sibley and his Confederate Army of the South led Texas Rangers to Santa Fe. At Glorieta Pass, New Mexico, the Northern Army turned the Army of the South. The Southerners lost three howitzers. The Navaho leader, Delgadito, who hoped to use Job and his men to fight his enemies with the small mountain cannons, captured Major Job Stewart of the Southern Army. Job hoped to unite the Western Indians and lead them against the Yankees. Becoming integrated into the Navaho nation, Job and his men helped the Navahos survive the Long Walk to Fort Summers where there was nothing but STARVATION! Job helped Degaditos people back to their homeland after he rescued his Spanish wife and their son.&lt;P&gt;Job and the Navahos Long Walk makes a compelling story straight out of the pages of history. The reader will live through cold winters and hot summers while following Navaho sheep. Mississippi men far from their Southern God adapt to a strange and sometimes barbaric world while they fight far survival in a hostile environment. When the war is over not a one of Jobs men return home. They cast their fates into a land of gold, desert, and mountains that touch the sky.&lt;/P&gt;" />
