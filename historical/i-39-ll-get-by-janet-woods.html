  <title>I&#39;ll Get By - Janet Woods</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meggie Elliot is a young woman of above average intelligence, and on the brink of adulthood. Living with her aunt and uncle in London at the outbreak of World War 2 she&#39;s intent on going to university, then pursuing a career in law. She is encouraged in this by her solicitor - a man she admires a little too much. Too old for her, he lets her know it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meggie follows her dream as best she can, knowing it&#39;s unlikely it will ever come to fruition. In a burst of patriotism she joins the WRNS to do her bit for the war effort. Sent to work in a decoding unit she meets the dangerously exhilarating young aristocrat, Nicholas Cowan, who sweeps her off her feet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Meggie suspects Nick of being the man who burgled her aunt&#39;s home, and to expose him would ruin a lot of lives. Against all reason Meggie and Nick begin to fall in love . . ." />
