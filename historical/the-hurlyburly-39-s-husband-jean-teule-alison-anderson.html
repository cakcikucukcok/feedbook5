  <title>The Hurlyburly&#39;s Husband - Jean Teule, Alison Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The Marquis de Montespan and his new wife, Ath&amp;#233;na&amp;#239;s, are that very rare thing: a true love-match. But love is not enough to maintain their hedonistic lifestyle, and the couple soon face huge debts. Then Madame de Montespan is offered the chance to turn their fortunes round, by becoming lady-in-waiting to the Queen at Versailles. Too late, Montespan discovers that his ravishing wife has caught the eye of King Louis XIV. Everyone congratulates him on his new status of cuckold by royal appointment, but the Marquis is broken-hearted. He vows to wreak revenge on the King and win back his adored Marquise. At once comic and poignant, Jean Teul&amp;#233;&amp;#8217;s extraordinary novel restores a ridiculed figure from history to his rightful position of hero: a man who loved his wife and dared challenge the absolute power of the Sun King himself.&lt;/div&gt;" />
