  <title>Sweet Love Ella&#39;s Story - Judy Veccia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After discovering her father&amp;rsquo;s uncle has asked for her to be sent to him to be wed to his neighbor, seventeen-year-old Ella KcKinsey cannot believe her parents mean to do it. She cannot help but feel she is being bartered in some sort of deal involving land and horses. Ella had dreamed of marrying her lifelong friend Cabhan and living near her parents and ten younger siblings in her beloved Ireland. But when it turns out that Cabhan supports the idea, Ella relents and sets sail to America.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Her voyage across the Atlantic in 1897 is filled with enough travails to last her a lifetime, or so Ella believes. Upon getting her feet on terra firma again, she learns that her father&amp;rsquo;s uncle has passed away and her wayward chaperone abandons her completely. Ella finds herself making her way to western Kentucky with her fianc&amp;eacute;, who makes it altogether clear he does not want to marry her, and his older brother, who can at best be described as prickly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When she arrives at her new home, a homestead founded in 1757 by Aiden Barnett, things begin to look up for Ella. She finds a grand home and horses on acres of pasture as green as Eire. Yet adjusting to her new lifestyle is a bit of a struggle for Ella, and she is certain the Barnett brothers have little use for her there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the coming months, years, and decades, Ella will leave a legacy for the generations of Barnett Irish horsewomen who will in turn become mistress to the homestead after her. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow Ella in Sweet Love, Ella&amp;rsquo;s Story as she deals in her own fashion with the joys and heartaches life brings her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
