          &lt;strong&gt;A Make-Believe Marriage&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cassie Phillips wasn&#39;t really married to Will Tolliver, no matter what he told people. Not that being the wife of a man as kind and thoughtful as Will wouldn&#39;t be a dream come true. But even Will would abandon her once he learned what she was running from.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cassie Phillips was the kind of girl you took home to mother, and Will was determined to do just that. But he&#39;d never expected that in order to protect her he&#39;d have to tell a lie that could get them both in a lot of trouble. Especially if he couldn&#39;t convince Cassie that marrying him for real was the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
