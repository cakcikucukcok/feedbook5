  <title>The Last Mission - Gene Spencer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The greatest generation was a hardworking, strong, loving people wanting what is now called the American Dream. Each would be propelled from their neighborhoods and slow-moving communities, a safe haven that cloaked them and held them securely, into a world war of destruction and death on December 7, 1941.  America had been awakened; Americans, a year earlier, saw and understood the evil destined for this country was now killing other peoples of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were to become a volunteer group of Americans assembled by two countries, America and China, to be the first to defend an innocent people.  Today they are known as the famed AVG or American Volunteer Group, the Flying Tigers. Their story is as vast as the war itself; it touched those it affected with death and destruction as it consumed everything in its path. Within the pages of this book, the story of one pilot and one nurse will be revealed, from when they volunteer, meet, fall in love, and marry while defending and saving the babies, the parents, the citizens of China and Burma.  Pete and Jane maintained their beliefs of duty and honor and sacrifice while they endured the horrors of war. Finding security in each others arms and a new spirit of love with each kiss, keeping them hopeful the war would end soon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
