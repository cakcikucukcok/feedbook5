  <title>The Day the Sun Shed Bloody Tears - Miya Davids</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the height of World War II, a surprise air raid has left a remote Japanese farming village in ruins, changing the world of three young women forever. In the fictionalized memoir &lt;i&gt;The Day the Sun Shed Bloody Tears,&lt;/i&gt; Taka, Yumi, and Miss Tami desperately attempt to survive amid the horrific ruins of war while holding onto a sliver of human dignity and the belief that their future is still full of hope.
Twenty-eight-year-old Taka is suddenly thrust into surrogate motherhood as she and her younger sister, Yumi, and a young slave Miss Tami, are left orphaned. Taka must lead the women through poverty, hunger, and fear as the chaos of war destroys everything they have ever known. As Taka chronicles an extraordinary life story that spans over four decades, she narrates how she and her sister survive nearly being sold as sex slaves and move in with an affluent family who teaches them how to love unconditionally, only to lose that same family through the atrocities of war.
The unforgettable experiences of three Japanese girls during before, during, and after World War II provides a compelling, historical glimpse into how one war transformed the lives of so many forever." />
