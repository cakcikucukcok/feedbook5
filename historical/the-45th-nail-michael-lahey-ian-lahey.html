  <title>The 45th Nail - Michael Lahey, Ian Lahey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Christmas card from Italy arrived on Robert Svenson&amp;rsquo;s desk. There was no return address, but when Bob opened the card, it was signed by his uncle, James Savorski. Nice, except for the fact that Uncle Jim was declared MIA back in &amp;rsquo;44. Forty years later he&amp;rsquo;s sending solid gold Etruscan amulets for Christmas presents? Bob resolved to travel to Italy to see if he could find his long lost uncle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How does one find a dead man in Italy without knowing the language or having an address? All Bob knew was that losing his luggage and his money the first night in Rome didn&amp;rsquo;t help. Then he found himself picking his way through a minefield of old scars and memories of war.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Along the way he journeys through Italy&amp;rsquo;s art and its incredible archaelological treasures, its history and people. A tale of war and mines and other things buried underground and even deeper&amp;mdash;in the hearts of those who lived those years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
