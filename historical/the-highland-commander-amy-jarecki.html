  <title>The Highland Commander - Amy Jarecki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Readers craving history entwined with their romance (a la &lt;i&gt;Outlander&lt;/i&gt;) will find everything they desire in Jarecki&#39;s latest. Scottish romance fans rejoice.&quot; --RT Book Reviews&lt;br&gt;  She cannot resist the man behind the mask...  As the illegitimate daughter of a Scottish earl, Lady Magdalen Keith is not one to partake in lavish balls or other frivolities. Yet at her father&#39;s urging, she agrees to dance with the battle-weary officers at this year&#39;s holiday masquerade. It&#39;s practically her civic duty! But when one such officer--whose dashing good looks cannot be disguised by a mere mask--sweeps her off her feet and into his arms, the innocent lass can&#39;t help herself. Her lips are his for the taking.&lt;br&gt;  But will he betray his country for a kiss?  Navy lieutenant Aiden Murray has spent too many months at sea to be immune to the charms of this lovely beauty. Even after he returns to his ship, she lives in his dreams. But when he discovers Maddie&#39;s true identity-and learns that her father is accused of treason-will the brawny Scot risk his life to follow his heart?&lt;br&gt;  &quot;This book hit all the right notes for me: swoon-worthy hero (oh, so, swoon-worthy); a sympathetic and capable heroine; intrigue and action scenes (fast paced); witty dialogue and banter; and sensual love scenes that grow the relationship. An excellent read.&quot; -- The Romance Dish" />
