  <title>The Boleyn Wife - Brandy Purdy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Shy, plain Lady Jane Parker feels out of place in Henry VIII&#39;s courtly world of glamour and intrigue--until she meets the handsome George Boleyn. Overjoyed when their fathers arrange a match, her dreams of a loving union are waylaid when she meets George&#39;s sister, Anne. For George is completely devoted to his sister, and cold and indifferent to his bride. As Anne acquires a wide circle of admirers, including King Henry, Jane&#39;s resentment grows. But if becoming Henry&#39;s queen makes Anne the most powerful woman in England, it also makes her highly vulnerable. And as Henry, desperate for a male heir, begins to tire of his mercurial wife, the stage is set for the ultimate betrayal.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Encompassing the reigns of four of Henry&#39;s wives, from the doomed Anne to the reckless Katherine Howard, &lt;i&gt;The Boleyn Wife&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable story of ambition, lust, and jealousy, of the power of love to change the course of history, and of the terrible price of revenge." />
