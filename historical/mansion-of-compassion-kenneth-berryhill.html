  <title>Mansion of Compassion - Kenneth Berryhill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mansions of Compassion
Two a half years in its creation, my novel, Mansions of Compassion, is set in pre and post Civil War years in and about New Orleans, Louisiana.
In New Orleans, on a bay inlet peninsula, was once a flourishing hotel, The French Quarter, resort that hosted the elite of society men and women of southern grace and charm.
The water inlet, known to native Frenchmen and well-to-do alike is simply, The Chateau.
The Chateau Laurent, with its lush greenery and red clay high cliffs, could not be seen from the bay and is only accessible for visitors from New Orleans by flat bottom river boats, guided only by seasoned river pilots from the Chateau or from New Orleans itself.
Antebellum mansions and several huge country houses, belonging to affluent cotton planters and politicians are hidden behind manicured acreage lawns and huge weeping willow trees. Prosperous vineyards and a huge orchard grace the countryside.
Decades after its huge success the Chateau Laurent falls into a state of economic disaster and decay. With it&#39;s original corrupt leaders gone and no younger generation to re-populate the once beautiful Chateau, The New Orleans New DayPreparatory School for Girls, as well, The French Quarter Hotel looks doomed.
A small pier, facing the bay, and away from the shallow rocks of the back waters berth deep hulled foreign frigates that arrive to sell apparel fashions and slaves to the highest bidders and wares to the not-so-affluent main populace of native employee Islanders.
The Isle is governed by two of its original wealthy elder settlers, Irishman John Lockridge and Englishman Isiah Crowe, together, at first they built an honest enterprise for the entertainment of the Southern elite and share the proceeds with the their employee Islanders.
John Lockridge and his family own a huge sprawling antebellum mansion called Walnut Manor, in which they host elaborate barbeques for elbow rubbing politicians and bureaucrats, on business trips from Georgetown, New York City, Baltimore, Richmond and Atlanta.
In addition, he owns several fast racehorses, and will stable private owned racehorses for the affluent clientel.
Powerful money changes hands at the oval race track known as Queen`s Way, the same bettors are invited to the dock area where they can choose from an array of imported apparel from the waterfront gazebos, domestic hand made custom carriages, purchase a tax free slave or two, or purchase quilts for the family back home. 
Isiah Crowe also owns a stately house on the Isle and, although not as wealthy as John Lockridge, he is the other business partner and the point man for scheduling events, paying the employee Islanders and making sure that the well-to-do visitors have all of the opportunity they need to spend their money.
A shrewd and calculating man, he doesn`t have Lockridges pleasant mannerisms, wit and class.
He doesn`t reinvest in the Isle, but takes his share of the proceeds to Georgetown where in the off season he builds and and operates a lucrative import and export dock, which he calls The Georgetown Wharf. 
When at the Isle, the wharf is managed by his cunning Barrack Master. 
Weary of its small handout proceed economy and the administration`s heavy handedness, many descendants of the original Islanders come to age in their own right and move away, to spoken of places that the rich southern visitors are from, or cities that the northern visitors are from, big city places that are talked about but not seen, like New York City, Baltimore or Philadelphia.
While John Lockridge lies ill with a devastating stroke, Isiah soon realizes that with the departure of more and more of the young populace the future of the Isle is gone and so are his investments in the racetrack and dock.
In the next two years, his share of the Isles profits dwindle, while the wharf takes shape and thrives in Georgetown.
