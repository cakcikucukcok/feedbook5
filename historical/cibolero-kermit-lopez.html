  <title>Cibolero - Kermit Lopez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For years, Antonio Baca lived the wandering and restless life of a Cibolero, or buffalo hunter, following the great herds that roamed the endless Llano Estacado-the high plains of a region that would one day be New Mexico. After marrying and settling down, Baca has finally found a modicum of peace in the home he built for his growing family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Baca witnesses the transformation of Nuevo Mexico from an isolated colonial outpost of the Spanish empire to a province of the newly independent nation of Mexico and, finally, to a land conquered by the avaricious &lt;I&gt;Americanos&lt;/I&gt;. Following the United States&#39;s seizure of New Mexico, Antonio and his countrymen find themselves treated as foreigners and second-class citizens in their own land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When his daughter, Elena, is kidnapped by a band of invading Texas Rangers after the American Civil War, Baca desperately tracks them across the llano of New Mexico and into Texas using his skills as a Cibolero. Terrified for his daughter&#39;s safety, he plunges into the world of the gringos, and discovers just how much the &lt;I&gt;Americanos &lt;/I&gt;have changed his homeland. But as the days pass without any sign of Elena, Baca fears for her life-and his own. &lt;/p&gt;" />
