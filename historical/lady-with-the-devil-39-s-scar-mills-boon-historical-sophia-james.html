          &lt;strong&gt;BEHIND THE ENEMY’S WALLS &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Badly disfigured Lady Isobel Dalceann has fought fiercely to defend her Keep, with little thought for her safety. Why, then, has she let a stranger within her walls? Whilst he threatens danger, his battered body marked by war mirrors her own scars and tempts her to put her faith in him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Marc de Courtenay is a mercenary and a loner, although he is drawn to damaged, beautiful Isobel. But in taking him into her highly defended buttressed walls she has unwittingly given him secrets that will enable him to betray her. What would she do if she were ever to find out who he really is…?&lt;/p&gt;
