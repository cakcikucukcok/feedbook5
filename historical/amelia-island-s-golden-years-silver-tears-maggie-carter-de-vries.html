  <title>Amelia Island’S Golden Years, Silver Tears - Maggie Carter-de Vries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story takes up where Amelias Secrets left off; after the murder trial  held in Jacksonville, Florida where the accused, great-great-grandson of  President Thomas Jefferson, T. J. Eppes murderer of one of his best friends and father of six children walks out of the courtroom a free man. 
He returns to Amelia Island there to carry on life as usual with his beautiful young bride Katie, expecting their first child, only to find life for her to be a daily trial by a jury of her peers; an impossible situation in the end.
Our protagonist John Whitner describes in detail not only their lives culminating in the great hurricane of 1898, which nearly devastates the island but through the lives of the Carnegies of Cumberland Island, Mrs. Leddy owner and operator of the Florida House Hotel and her only child Grace from age eight through her progression to adulthood, marriage, babies and widowhood at the young age of twenty one.
John, himself reveals his journey through all this, his relationship with Pauline; its ups and downs, a new woman in his life (or women) as well as his passion for photography in the many places he visits, Jekyl Island, Charleston, S. C. during the earthquake of 1886 and Chicagos Worlds fair of 1893.
Meticulous research and beautiful descriptions bring nineteenth century Amelia Island to life. With creative flair, Ms. Carter-de Vries uses the first person narrative of her storyteller, John Whitner, to recreate the turbulence of natural disasters and societys mores and make the past inhabitants of Amelia Island walk off the pages.
Whether youre a visitor to the island or a life-long resident, you will find much to enjoy in Carter-de Vries Golden Years, Silver Tears.
