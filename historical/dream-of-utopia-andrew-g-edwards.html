  <title>Dream of Utopia - Andrew G. Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a time of death and tragedy, in a hard and distant future, a city lies on a path to peril and destruction. With the people of the nation on the brink of revolt, and mutated creatures at the gate, one common man must make the vital decisions that could lead mankind to a glorious recovery &amp;ndash; or horrific destitution.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Randall Adams, was a man among the millions of others, serving in a job in which he could be easily replaced. Like many others, he is well aware of the police state that thrives around him. After the regime&amp;rsquo;s most barbaric act yet, the public refuses to remain silent any longer. Adams finds himself wrapped up in the war that no one wanted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the vicious battlegrounds that the Acropolis would become, in the land the settlers once called New Earth. As the shells silenced thousands each day, forevermore. As the bloody carcasses of those that once lived are dragged to the medical stations to check for even the semblance of life- Randall Adams realizes that the &lt;em&gt;Dream of Utopia&lt;/em&gt; was perhaps, only a dream.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Will Randall find the wisdom to bridge the gap between morality and the reality of war?&lt;/p&gt;" />
