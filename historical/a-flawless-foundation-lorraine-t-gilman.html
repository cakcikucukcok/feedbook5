  <title>A Flawless Foundation - Lorraine T. Gilman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is the summer of 1961, and Irene is spending summer in Mt. Vernon, New York with her grandmother. Irene is restless and dreams of earning money to buy new clothes; culottes. Papagallo shoes, and pill box hats like Mrs. Kennedys are all the rage. She just knows she will be successful selling make up door to door. Little does she know, there is more behind the closed doors in Grandmas neighborhood than the serene housewives depicted on the pages of her Rose Petal Princess sales manual. Behind every door is a story, and Irene is about to learn more about life than she bargained for, but its an experience she wouldnt sell for anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this, her second book, author Lorraine Gilman weaves a story of unexpected hope, friendship and redemption in the quiet neighborhood of her youth. Filled with iconic and engaging characters, A Flawless Foundation captures the reader from start and doesnt let go until the immensely satisfying last bite.&lt;/p&gt;" />
