  <title>Prelude to a Distant Future - Sandra J. Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Four women, different backgrounds, different temperaments, are unexpectedly recruited for a secretive Code-11 assignment. Their objective: assassinate four key men who threaten to topple the American government from within. However, for these ladies, the mission is not their greatest challenge. Traveling back in time to 1940s Nazi-Germany in order to complete the assignment is.
The women enlisted to pull off such a mission: Headstrong Gabrielle Cyntrell, explosives expert. Belligerent Carlotta Charly Morgonelli, knife-wielding rebel. Damaged Rebecca Stanton, weapons designer. Genteel Corrine Eizenberg, research chemist. And according to their boss, hard-core Junifer Morison, this unique group was chosen for three distinct reasons: theyre experts in their field, all are 50-something women fluent in German, making them less likely to be identified as killers, and theyre expendable. 
From the top-secret bureaucracy of present day U.S. government, to the former sinister regime of Hitlers army, Prelude is a high-stakes thriller which finds four flawed women traveling back to the past  while one woman stays behind in the present  bravely fighting for their very lives. Their mission is clear: avert a modern-day Holocaust in order to preserve life and liberty of their beloved United States of America  or die trying." />
