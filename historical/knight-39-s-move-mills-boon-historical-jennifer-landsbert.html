          &lt;strong&gt;A Husband Returned&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wed as a young girl to Sir Guy of Abbascombe, Hester had never known true married life, for after a fight with his father, her lord husband had left for the Crusades. After several years, Hester assumed her husband was dead, and looked forward to a lifetime of managing the land and the people she loved. So she was shocked to her toes when Guy returned! There was no doubt he was a man in the prime of his life, fully intending to take back control of his domain–including his wife! But the question was–would she have him as her husband once more?&lt;/p&gt;
