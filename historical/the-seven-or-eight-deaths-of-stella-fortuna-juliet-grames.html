  <title>The Seven or Eight Deaths of Stella Fortuna - Juliet Grames</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Calabria to Connecticut: a sweeping family saga about sisterhood, secrets, Italian immigration, the American dream, and one woman&#39;s tenacious fight against her own fate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Stella Fortuna, death has always been a part of life. Stella&amp;#8217;s childhood is full of strange, life-threatening incidents&amp;#8212;moments where ordinary situations like cooking eggplant or feeding the pigs inexplicably take lethal turns. Even Stella&amp;#8217;s own mother is convinced that her daughter is cursed or haunted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her rugged Italian village, Stella is considered an oddity&amp;#8212;beautiful and smart, insolent and cold. Stella uses her peculiar toughness to protect her slower, plainer baby sister Tina from life&amp;#8217;s harshest realities. But she also provokes the ire of her father Antonio: a man who demands subservience from women and whose greatest gift to his family is his absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Fortunas emigrate to America on the cusp of World War II, Stella and Tina must come of age side-by-side in a hostile new world with strict expectations for each of them. Soon Stella learns that her survival is worthless without the one thing her family will deny her at any cost: her independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In present-day Connecticut, one family member tells this heartrending story, determined to understand the persisting rift between the now-elderly Stella and Tina. A richly told debut, &lt;em&gt;The Seven or Eight Deaths of Stella Fortuna &lt;/em&gt;is a tale of family transgressions as ancient and twisted as the olive branch that could heal them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Witty and deeply felt.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;Entertainment Weekly (New and Notable)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Seven or Eight Deaths of Stella Fortuna achieves what no sweeping history lesson about American immigrants could: It brings to life a woman that time and history would have ignored.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;Washington Post&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
