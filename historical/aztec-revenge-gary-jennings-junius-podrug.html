  <title>Aztec Revenge - Gary Jennings, Junius Podrug</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Juan is a &quot;mestizo,&quot; of mixed Spanish and Indio heritage, sure to be doomed to a short, violent life begging on the streets. But Juan has a special gift for handling horses and an ability to defend himself at a time when a man&#39;s best friends are his horse and his sword. Only El Mestizo, the half-caste son of the conqueror Cortés, knows that the blood of kings flows in the young beggar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After killing a man for beating a horse, Juan becomes a highwayman and horse thief before disguising himself as a wealthy caballero. He is wined and dined by the richest and most powerful people in the colony--who don&#39;t realize that some of them had once stared down the barrel of Juan&#39;s pistola as he took their gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting, conniving, and loving in a colorful era of flashing swords and brave hearts, Juan must use all the tricks he learned as a beggar and a bandit to unlock the secret of his own heritage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
