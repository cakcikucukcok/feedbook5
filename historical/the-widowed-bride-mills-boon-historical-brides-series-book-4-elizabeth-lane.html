  <title>The Widowed Bride (Mills &amp; Boon Historical) (Brides Series, Book 4) - Elizabeth Lane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Indulge your fantasies of delicious Regency Rakes, fierce Viking warriors and rugged Highlanders. Be swept away into a world of intense passion, lavish settings and romance that burns brightly through the centuries&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Known to her friends as a free spirit, Elizabeth Lane has traveled the world in search of new adventures and good stories.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She has lived in Mexico, Guatemala, Panama and Germany and traveled to such exotic spots as China and Nepal, but she is most at peace in the mountains of her native Utah. As of this writing, she lives in a suburb of Salt Lake City with an eighteen-year-old cat named PowderPuff.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Single since 1984, Elizabeth has raised a son and two daughters. One daughter, who died in an accident in 1985, is still a loving presence in her mother&#39;s life. The other two children are grown and thriving, and Elizabeth revels in her new loves her grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth is, perhaps, too easily lured by new challenges. She loves hiking, photography, belly dancing, animals, Native American culture, and any kind of music. She has pursued whales off Baja California, trekked the Himalayas, rafted the Grand Canyon, and even taken a flying lesson. Since 1983 she has worked full-time as an educational software designer. But her favorite pastime is writing lively, passionate stories that will reach out and touch her readers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her novels have been published in ten languages and enjoyed in many parts of the world. Elizabeth&#39;s first novel, a historical saga about the Spanish conquest of Mexico, was published in 1980. Several more sagas followed, including two books set in China. When the market for big, serious historical novels faded, it took her four lean years to make the transition to romance. Wind River, her first Harlequin Historical, was published in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She has also written several contemporary Silhouette books. &quot;Everyone and everything has a story&quot; Elizabeth is fond of saying when asked about her ideas. &quot;From the penny in your hand to the stranger in the grocery line, each set of experiences is unique. Look around you and listen with your imagination. You&#39;ll have stories to write for a lifetime. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Elizabeth Loves hearing from her readers. You can contact her at her e-mail address, elizl@uswest. net, or write to her in care of Harlequin Reader Services.&lt;/em&gt;
