  <title>Metis: Mixed Blood Stories: Mixed Blood Stories - Lynn Ponton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Metis are the descendants of Cree and Assiniboine women who joined with French and Scottish men to raise children and shape a hybrid culture in the heart of Canada. In &quot;Metis, Mixed Blood Stories,&quot; four generations of adolescents come of age during their sixteenth year. Together their voices tell the story of one family and of a people. Matriarch Angeline describes her ride on the last great buffalo hunt of the 1860s and her relationship with charismatic Metis leader Louie Riel. Her grandson, Gilles, relates his escape from a Chicago orphanage and his fight to stay out of reservation school. Gilles&#39;s daughter, Elisabeth, fights to protect the rights of native youth in the violent 1968 U.S. Democratic Convention. The novel closes with the vibrant voice with which it begins, that of great-granddaughter Annie, whose creativity as a young author and filmmaker will ensure that the legacy of their culture lives on. LYNN PONTON is the author of two previous books of nonfiction, &quot;The Romance of Risk: Why Teenagers Do the Things They Do&quot; and &quot;The Sex Lives of Teenagers: Revealing the Secret World of Adolescent Boys and Girls.&quot; She has been a columnist for Salon.com and has published widely in numerous magazines, newspapers, and journals. A practicing psychoanalyst, she is Professor of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. This is her first work of fiction." />
