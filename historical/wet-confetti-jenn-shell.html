  <title>Wet Confetti - Jenn Shell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Rolled, silver white hair created a halo about the woman&#39;s head. The lamplight cast oblique shadows on her delicate, high cheekbones. Above the cheekbones, her eyes were ice blue and steady, belying the eighty years of this statuesque woman. Her demeanor exhibited and commanded an aura of aristocracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Kathleen&#39;s throat tightened and felt dry. She trembled slightly as she spoke. She was a reasonably intelligent, thirty-eight-year-old woman quite capable of comprehending all that had been depicted and yet, the shocking concept of the old woman&#39;s claim was loathsome and incredulous. Acceptance of such cruel allegations against her grandmother, whom she so admired, was totally denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
In this emotionally charged family saga, Kathleen is shocked to learn of her grandmother&#39;s wicked past from her Great Aunt Rose. As if the shocking revelations aren&#39;t hard enough for Kathleen to deal with, she is forced to make a decision that will determine the course of her future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
