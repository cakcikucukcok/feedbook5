  <title>Two Sisters Singing - Carmen Cullen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Surrounded by the beauty of her native Mayo, eighteen-year-old Lily dreams of being a famous singer on the London stage - but her parents have planned a more normal life for her, taking a degree in UCD. But leaving home also means leaving a passionate romance with a handsome, visiting American named Theo. Once in Dublin, secrets and betrayal abound when Lily&#39;s sister Moyra begins a relationship with Theo and Lily&#39;s Aunt Terry, a nun, appears to be harbouring a hidden past. As Moyra&#39;s relationship with Theo turns grim, she desperately needs her sister&#39;s support to keep tragedy at bay. But, still longing to perform, Lily finds herself at a crossroads in life. Disturbing yet heartwarming, critical yet nostalgic, Carmen Cullen delivers a convincing portrayal of both the warmth and the wrath of 1940s&#39; Ireland. Never flinching from the savage social impact of the Church&#39;s power, Cullen&#39;s writing also conveys the charming and simplistic quality of the time as reflected in the lines of classic Irish ballads, particularly those by the author&#39;s iconic aunt, Delia Murphy. This heartfelt and bittersweet story is a stirring evocation of a bygone era." />
