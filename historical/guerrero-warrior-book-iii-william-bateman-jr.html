  <title>Guerrero (Warrior) Book Iii - William Bateman Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The circle is closed as the boys in their desperation to flee from the wrath of Pancho Villa return to the very place they started from, the Hacienda De Venge, in hopes of throwing off Villa, if he has any thoughts of revenge for when they helped free Don Juan Belden. 
Once back at the Hacienda, the brothers realize that this is where their roads to the future bring them to a parting of ways. The boys have come home after over two years of being away only to find that they are now in a war of will and nerves in order to win the love of Don Cristobals daughters, Carmela and Alberta. The brothers find that they must bump heads with the two suitors the girls have acquired in their absence, and it turns out to be a war of a different type, a war where there are no physical adversaries or material foes. But after surviving run-ins with bandits, thugs and Mother Nature, the brothers, used to adversity, take on this new challenge without complaining. 
This story is a mixture of fiction with a large dash of fact, and was inspired by my fertile imagination and the many stories I was told by a very credible and wonderful man who lived through it all and shared his past with me.
