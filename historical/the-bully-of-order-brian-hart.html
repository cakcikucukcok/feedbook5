  <title>The Bully of Order - Brian Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set in a logging town on the lawless Pacific coast of Washington State at the turn of the twentieth century, a spellbinding novel of fate and redemption&amp;#8212;told with a muscular lyricism and filled with a cast of characters Shakespearean in scope&amp;#8212;in which the lives of an ill-fated family are at the mercy of violent social and historical forces that tear them apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keen to make his fortune, Jacob Ellstrom, armed with his medical kit and new wife, Nell, lands in The Harbor&amp;#8212;a mud-filled, raucous coastal town teeming with rough trade pioneers, sawmill laborers, sailors, and prostitutes. But Jacob is not a doctor, and a botched delivery exposes his ruse, driving him onto the streets in a plunge towards alcoholism. Alone, Nell scrambles to keep herself and their young son, Duncan, safe in this dangerous world. When a tentative reunion between the couple&amp;#8212;in the company of Duncan and Jacob&amp;#8217;s malicious brother, Matius&amp;#8212;results in tragedy, Jacob must flee town to elude being charged with murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, the wild and reckless Duncan seems to be yet another of The Harbor&amp;#8217;s hoodlums. His only salvation is his overwhelming love for Teresa Boyerton, the daughter of the town&amp;#8217;s largest mill owner. But disaster will befall the lovers with heartbreaking consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And across town, Bellhouse, a union boss and criminal rabble-rouser, sits at the helm of The Harbor&amp;#8217;s seedy underbelly, perpetuating a cycle of greed and violence. His thug Tartan directs his pack of thieves, pimps, and murderers, and conceals an incendiary secret involving Duncan&amp;#8217;s mother. As time passes, a string of calamitous events sends these characters hurtling towards each other in an epic collision that will shake the town to its core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
