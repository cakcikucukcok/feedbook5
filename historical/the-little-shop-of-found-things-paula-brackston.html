  <title>The Little Shop of Found Things - Paula Brackston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Witch&#39;s Daughter&lt;/i&gt; Paula Brackston returns to her trademark blend of magic and romance guaranteed to enchant in &lt;i&gt;The Little Shop of Found Things&lt;/i&gt;, the first book in a new continuing series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An antique shop haunted by a ghost.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;A silver treasure with an injustice in its story.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;An adventure to the past she&#39;ll never forget.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Xanthe and her mother Flora leave London behind for a fresh start, taking over an antique shop in the historic town of Marlborough. Xanthe has always had an affinity with some of the antiques she finds. When she touches them, she can sense something of the past they come from and the stories they hold. When she has an intense connection to a beautiful silver chatelaine she has to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is while she&#39;s examining the chatelaine that she&#39;s transported back to the seventeenth century where it has its origins. She discovers there is an injustice in its history. The spirit that inhabits her new home confronts her and charges her with saving her daughter&#39;s life, threatening to take Flora&#39;s if she fails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Xanthe fights to save the girl amid the turbulent days of 1605, she meets architect Samuel Appleby. He may be the person who can help her succeed. He may also be the reason she can&#39;t bring herself to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story continues in October 2019 with book two in the Found Things series, &lt;i&gt;Secrets of the Chocolate House&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
