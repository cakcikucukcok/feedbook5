Ernt Allbright came home from the Vietnam War a changed and volatile man. When he loses yet another job, he makes the impulsive decision to move his wife and daughter north where they will live off the grid in America&#39;s last true frontier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cora will do anything for the man she loves, even if means following him into the unknown.

The long, sunlit days and the generosity of the locals make up for the newcomers&#39; lack of preparation and dwindling resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as winter approaches and darkness descends, Ernt&#39;s fragile mental state deteriorates. Soon the perils outside pale in comparison to threats from within. In their small cabin, covered in snow, blanketed in eighteen hours of night, Leni and her mother learn the terrible truth: they are on their own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
