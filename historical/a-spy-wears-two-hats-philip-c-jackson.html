  <title>A Spy Wears Two Hats - Philip C. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fifteen year-old Tommy Miller is determined to stop Yankee General George McClellaneven if he has to kill the cruel Union leader. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tommy is taken captive by Union soldiers, escapes, and is recruited by Captain John Mosby to spy for the Confederacy.   He agrees.  He feels that is the fastest path to reach McClellan.  Fearing for his life at every bend in the road, Tommy uses his innate ability as an actor to convince Union soldiers and leaders along the way that he is a Yankee.&lt;rb&gt;&lt;rb&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Conquering terror-filled nights, and slogging through unrelenting icy rain downpours, Tommy changes hats as he spies for the Confederacy.  He saves a fellow teenaged soldier, Roger Pinkerton,albeit a Yankee amidst the battle on Malvern Hill.  He then moves on to alert General Lee of McClellans overwhelming Yankee dominance in terms of numbers of troops geared up for battle on the banks of the James River.&lt;rb&gt;&lt;rb&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When Janey OReilly, Tommys girlfriend, is assaulted by passing Yankees close to home near Malvern Hill, Tommy sets out in search of the guilty party.  But first he must switch hats, resuming his role as a Yankee private, before he can inflict his revenge.&lt;rb&gt;&lt;rb&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After switching hats again on his way east toward Sharpesburg and Harpers Ferry as a Union private, Tommy learns that General McClellan has been ordered to step down as Commander of the Army of the PotomacYankee General John Pope takes over command with President Lincolns sudden order.  As battle erupts along Antietum Creek, between Sharpsburg and South Mountain, Tommy is torn between fighting as a union soldier or his true Confederate Rebel self.  The Confederacy is the choice.  Tommy Miller jumps across the Antietum Creek amid flying cannon balls, takes up his weapon and fires at Yankees.  He sees, hears and smells too much death. He heeds the battle cry of fellow Confederates, to go along with General Robert E. Lee.&lt;rb&gt;&lt;rb&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After the battle, Tommy makes his way south toward Washington where he tries to contact President Lincoln but is rebuffed.  Frustrated by Yankees unwilling to accept anything like a peace plan, he determines that a recipe for ending the War is essential. He meets with an inspired Roger Pinkerton and together they head north toward Delaware.  Tommy and Roger decide that the best way to end this horrible War is to start a detective agency, like Rogers uncle did before the War.  Theyll call it The Miller Pinkerton Detective Bureau, go undercover and undermine War campaign efforts of both sides, spy where needed and end fighting among brothers and sistersmothers and fathers
