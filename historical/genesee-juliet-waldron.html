  <title>Genesee - Juliet Waldron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born to a runaway teen and Iroquois Warrior, struggles to find her place, her loyalties eternally torn between two warring peoples. When the American Revolution sets the Mohawk Valley ablaze, will a young soldier’s love prove strong enough to save her?  Born to a runaway teen and Iroquois Warrior, struggles to find her place, her loyalties eternally torn between two warring peoples. When the American Revolution sets the Mohawk Valley ablaze, will a young soldier’s love prove strong enough to save her?  GENESEE is an extraordinary book about love, hardship and prejudice. It&#39;s well written and full of wonderful characters. Even though they have many differences, Genesee and Alexander are true kindred spirits. Ms. Waldron keeps you enthralled by, a little at a time, giving tantalizing tidbits of their origins. This story isn&#39;t sugarcoated, which is really refreshing. There are some instances of violence, but they&#39;re brief and handled well. Anyone who enjoys an honest, realistic story will love this one. Renee Burnette" />
