  <title>A Hatred for Tulips - Richard Lourie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;People who don&#39;t have secrets imagine them as dark and hidden. It&#39;s just the opposite. Secrets are bright. They light you up. Like the bare lightbulb left on in a cell day and night, they give you no rest.&quot;&lt;br&gt;            So thinks Joop, the narrator of this brief and bitter tale, whose secret is like no other. He has kept that secret for more than sixty years, but now his brother---whom he has not seen since the end of the war---has suddenly shown up at his door.&lt;br&gt;            Having grown up in North America with only the vaguest memories of World War II, Joop&#39;s brother has returned to Amsterdam to find out what his childhood in Holland had been like. But what he discovers is much more than he bargained for---he is startled and dismayed to learn of his own role in the betrayal of Anne Frank.&lt;br&gt;            Transporting readers through the agonizing Nazi takeover of World War II, Joop recounts his role as a boy desiring to feed his starving family. He figures out a way to provide for them, but in doing so, he sets in motion a chain of events that will horrify the entire world.&lt;br&gt;            Just as he did in the internationally acclaimed &lt;i&gt;The Autobiography of Joseph Stalin, &lt;/i&gt;here Richard Lourie takes us into not only a person&#39;s mind, a time, and a place, but into the treacherous currents of history that sweep lives away. This gripping fictionalized account of the man who betrayed Anne Frank will not soon be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;" />
