  <title>Jesse James &amp; the Secret Legend of Captain Coytus - Alex Mueck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A historical fiction comedy that packs as much heart as humor. &lt;p&gt;
Michael Dadich, award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;The Silver Sphere&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When a Harvard history professor receives a thesis paper titled &lt;em&gt;Jesse James and the Secret Legend of Captain Coytus&lt;/em&gt;, from Ulysses Hercules Baxteran underwhelming studenthe assumes the paper must be a prank. He has never read such maniacal balderdash in his life. But after he calls a meeting with the student, Professor Gladstone is dismayed when Baxter declares the work is his own. As he takes a very unwilling Professor Gladstone back in time via his thesis, Baxters grade hangs in the balance as he attempts to prove his theory.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
It is 1864 as philanderer and crusader Captain Coytus embarks on a mission to avenge his fathers death and infiltrates the Confederate Bushwacker posse looking for the man responsible, Jesse Woodson James. Accompanied by the woman of his dreams, Coytus soon finds himself temporarily appointed to be the sheriff of Booneville and commissions his less-than-loyal deputy to help him carry out his plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But when tragedy strikes, the Captain is forced to change his immature ways and redefine his lofty missionmore or less.&lt;/p&gt;" />
