  <title>Question Authority - John MacDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Susan, a young White House staffer, becomes suspicious when one of her colleagues disappears. The colleagues sister informs Susan that her brother suspects the administration is raising money on the black market in Vietnam to help finance the presidents 1968 re-election. The colleagues sister also informs Susan that four Navy SEALs were killed in Vietnam when they intercepted the presidents campaign money. 
A car is reported burned, with an unidentified body inside, the day Susans colleague disappears. Susan suspects her friend was murdered.
When a man Susan believes to be involved with her colleagues disappearance approaches her, she escapes. Susan travels to Vietnam, with a Navy SEAL she knew from home, and uncovers evidence exposing the black market. Susan gets caught in the Tet offensive of 1968 and kills a Viet Cong. 
At the time her colleague disappeared, Susan was dating a member of the administration. Part of the evidence she uncovers in Vietnam proves her boyfriend is involved in the black market.
Susan and the SEAL travel back to the United States and turn the evidence over to a former boyfriend of Susans who is an FBI agent. The result of uncovering the black market has a devastating effect on the 1968 presidential election." />
