  <title>The Highlander&#39;s Sword - Amanda Forester</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A quiet, flame-haired beauty with secrets of her own...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She&#39;s nothing he expected and everything he really needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lady Aila Graham is destined for the convent, until her brother&#39;s death leaves her an heiress. Soon she is caught between hastily arranged marriage with a Highland warrior, the Abbot&#39;s insistence that she take her vows, the Scottish Laird who kidnaps her, and the traitor from within who betrays them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Padyn MacLaren, a battled-hardened knight, returns home to the Highlands after years of fighting the English in France. MacLaren bears the physical scars of battle, but it is the deeper wounds of betrayal that have rocked his faith. Arriving with only a band of war-weary knights, MacLaren finds his land pillaged and his clan scattered. Determined to restore his clan, he sees Aila&#39;s fortune as the answer to his problems...but maybe it&#39;s the woman herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Highlander Series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Highlander&#39;s Sword (Book 1)&lt;br&gt;The Highlander&#39;s Heart (Book 2)&lt;br&gt;True Highland Spirit (Book 3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for Amanda Forester:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;This clever combination of wit, romance, and suspense strikes all the right notes.&quot; -Booklist, Starred Review on &lt;em&gt;A Wedding in Springtime&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;Plenty of intrigue keeps the reader cheering all the way.&quot; — &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;Passionate and spellbinding!&quot; — Mary Wine, acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Highland Heat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A quiet, flame-haired beauty with secrets of her own...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She&#39;s nothing he expected and everything he really needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lady Aila Graham is destined for the convent, until her brother&#39;s death leaves her an heiress.
