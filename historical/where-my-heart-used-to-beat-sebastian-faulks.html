  <title>Where My Heart Used to Beat - Sebastian Faulks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sweeping drama about the madness of war and the power of love that marks acclaimed novelist Sebastian Faulks&#39;s return, after twenty years, to the fictional territory of his #1 international bestseller &lt;i&gt;Birdsong&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London, 1980. Robert Hendricks, an established psychiatrist and author, has so bottled up memories of his own wartime past that he is nearly sunk into a life of aloneness and depression. Out of the blue, a baffling letter arrives from one Dr. Alexander Pereira, a neurologist and a World War I veteran who claims to be an admirer of Robert&#39;s published work. The letter brings Robert to the older man&#39;s home on a rocky, secluded island off the south of France, and into tempests of memories--his childhood as a fatherless English boy, the carnage he witnessed and the wound he can&#39;t remember receiving as a young officer in World War II, and, above all, the great, devastating love of his life, an Italian woman, &quot;L,&quot; whom he met during the war. As Robert&#39;s recollections pour forth, he&#39;s unsure whether they will lead to psychosis--or redemption. But Dr. Pereira knows. Profoundly affecting and masterfully told, &lt;i&gt;Where My Heart Used to Beat&lt;/i&gt; sweeps through the 20th century, brilliantly interrogating the darkest corners of the human mind and bearing tender witness to the abiding strength of love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
