Viktor is a spy from the USSR who arrives via Greyhound bus with his young son, Vlad. They are quickly helped by Hank, a devout Christian, who finds lodging for them and helps Viktor start his own bait and tackle shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four-year-old Vlad adapts to his new American home even though he misses his mother back in Russia, while his father carries out spy assignments. Viktors brilliant mind is soon tormented as he is forced to deal with circumstances beyond his control. When he develops feelings for a Florida woman, Laura, the turmoil almost gets the best of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his heart, Viktor is a family man, but he is also loyal to his republic. His face-to-face talk with USA counterespionage agents is mandatory. After Viktor disappeared, a young lady digs deeper into the life of Viktorbut is she ready to uncover the many mysteries of a Russian spy and the woman he lovedeven if it takes her all the way to the USSR?&lt;/p&gt;" />
