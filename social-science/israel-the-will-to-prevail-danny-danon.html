  <title>Israel: The Will to Prevail - Danny Danon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Danny Danon has been a vocal opponent of disengaging in the Gaza Strip and West bank, and transforming the stalemate &quot;two state/one state&quot; dialogue to include regional partners, at times standing in direct opposition to his own party&#39;s leadership. A well-known and frequent speaker in the global arena, he is the rising voice for a fresh movement toward nationalism among the generation of Israelis currently coming to power. Here, Danon shares this vision with the world. It is a bold and uncompromising stance in the face of attacks on Israel&#39;s sovereignty by other Middle Eastern nations as the United States sends mixed signals of support to further its own goals in the region. Danon dissects the missteps and wrong turns that Israel&#39;s politicians have taken in the past by working to appease the United States and not offend their neighbors, instead of prioritizing their nation&#39;s own viability. With electrifying zeal, he tackles the challenges Israel faces today to undo what he sees as a consequence brought on by years of acquiescence to US policy. Danon believes &quot;US pressure on Israel is hurting Israel and will do nothing to advance peace&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danon leads the charge toward a victorious future with an invitation for the United States and the Middle East to participate in, and not just dictate, Israel&#39;s international relations and policies (as opposed to an Israel cuckolded with an endless array of caveats toward those who would see it fall). No stranger to controversy, Danon&#39;s unabashed insights are a welcome revelation in the current quagmire of Middle-East international relations. A leading speaker to both Jewish groups and Christian Conservatives, the &lt;i&gt;LA Jewish Journal&lt;/i&gt; says &quot;What Danny says is what Bibi is actually thinking.&quot; For Danny Danon, this is only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
