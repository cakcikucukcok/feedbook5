  <title>Game, Set, Match - Susan Ware</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Billie Jean King trounced Bobby Riggs in tennis&#39;s &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; in 1973, she placed sports squarely at the center of a national debate about gender equity. In this winning combination of biography and history, Susan Ware argues that King&#39;s challenge to sexism, the supportive climate of second-wave feminism, and the legislative clout of Title IX sparked a women&#39;s sports revolution in the 1970s that fundamentally reshaped American society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While King did not single-handedly cause the revolution in women&#39;s sports, she quickly became one of its most enduring symbols, as did Title IX, a federal law that was initially passed in 1972 to attack sex discrimination in educational institutions but had its greatest impact by opening opportunities for women in sports. King&#39;s place in tennis history is secure, and now, with &lt;i&gt;Game, Set, Match&lt;/i&gt;, she can take her rightful place as a key player in the history of feminism as well. By linking the stories of King and Title IX, Ware explains why women&#39;s sports took off in the 1970s and demonstrates how giving women a sporting chance has permanently changed American life on and off the playing field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
