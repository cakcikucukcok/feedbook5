  <title>Down Street, Saint Thomas and Beyond - Eric E. Dawson Esq.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Virtually nothing has ever been
written about life in Down Street
while much has been written about
Up Street St. Thomas because
government and business offi ces
were and still are dominant in that
area of the town. Much took place in
the Down Street area, especially in
the distillation of rum which brought
millions of federal tax revenue into
the Treasury of the Government
of the Virgin Islands. The first ever
luxury hotel in the territory was
built in Estate John Dunko, below
Down Street and employed over
200 persons during its construction
period and generated a $7000 weekly
payroll. Th ere are many professional
persons who hail from the area.&lt;/p&gt;" />
