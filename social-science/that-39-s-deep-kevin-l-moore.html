      <meta name="description" content="Real, raw and refreshing are just a few adjectives that describe this insightful work of art.  Through his various experiences growing up in the inner city, Kevin Laron Moore, a.k.a. Height, was blessed with the unique ability to discern and articulate the many realities of Black life in America.  The language is sometimes cutting, but with his exceptional word rhyming style, the author holds his readers spellbound.  Emotions are taken on a rollercoaster ride by the authors accurate and incontrovertible contents.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book is all about reflections of the writers experiences in America.  The seven REFLECTIONS and BONUS CHAPTER, discuss in turn - pain, promise, and evolution in its:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Reflections on Youth, &lt;br&gt;
	Reflections on Black Men and Black Women,&lt;br&gt;
	Reflections on Self-Determination,&lt;br&gt;
	Reflections on Community and Self-hatred,&lt;br&gt;
	Reflections on Black Life in America,&lt;br&gt;
	Reflections on Family,&lt;br&gt;
	Reflections on God and Religion, and&lt;br&gt;
	Five Bullets and a Blessing (Bonus Chapter).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
While these reflections and bonus chapter are written from the viewpoints of the Authors empirical knowledge, many who have experienced his lifes journey will understand and strongly relate, while others who are open to walking in anothers shoes will learn and be transformed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The notes (thoughts) herein can be described as a serious, urban, social commentary written in a poetic format.  It is a journey from a valley of pain and desolation to the heights of promise and ultimate potential.  Thats Deep!: Reflections on the Afterlife of a Black Student is simply a MUST-READ BOOK!!!  It is a sociological work that will teach others and remind those who have felt the sting firsthand of the devastating impact of Americas separate and unequal treatment of many of its voiceless citizenry.  It is a history lesson to people of all races and nationalities of the matchless, resilient and soulful spirit of Africa and all of her outreached descendants.  It is also a powerful message that without Gods love, mercy and grace, ones life is purposeless, empty and unprotected." />
