  <title>Volvo Amazon - Richard Dredge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1956, a prototype of a new passenger car from Volvo was presented. It became known as the Amazon in Sweden and the 121 and 122S in export markets, the latter denoting a more sporty derivative. However, despite its substantial appearance, all Amazons were surprisingly fleet of foot - this was one of the most sporty European saloons of the 1960s. With its elegant, timeless styling the Amazon broke new ground for Volvo - and for passenger cars as a whole. This new book covers the complete story of the Volvo Amazon, from 1956 onwards, including full production histories, comprehensive specification details, and over 250 photographs. The book covers the history of Volvo before and after the Amazon, and development and production of all Amazon derivatives from 1956-1970, including the 121, 122S, 123GT and all of the estate editions. There are biographies of key Volvo personnel, including the company&#39;s first designer, Jan Wilsgaard. Also included is the Amazon in motorsport, plus driver biographies: Tom Trana, Sylvia Osterberg and Carl-Magnus Skogh. There is a full buying guide along with tips on tuning and modifying, including rally preparation, and an insight into what the press thought of each Amazon derivative, with pages also devoted to how the car was marketed in period. An ideal resource for owners, or anyone with an interest in the evolution of these classic cars, which is superbly illustrated with 250 colour photographs." />
