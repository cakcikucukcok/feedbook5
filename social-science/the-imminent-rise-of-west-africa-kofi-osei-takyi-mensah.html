  <title>The Imminent Rise of West Africa - Kofi Osei Takyi-Mensah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When the time has come for a new society to make inroads in developing better and sustained living standards for its mass people, its unique creation and growth of its wealth, and its prominent impact upon humanity, it has to go beyond and push the boundariesand this leads to creating a distinct and an efficient society. It is properly understood that no earthly and heavenly power can deny a peoples aspiration whose time has come to formulate bona fide solutions for their chronic challenges, long-lasting crises, and for a better extension of humanity in this moment, and the time to come. 
The future has arrived. For the purpose of West Africa to be realized and fulfilled, West Africa needs to unite into a sovereign state with a federal republic government to create a distinct and an efficient federal nation inside West Africa called the African States Union (ASU).
The ASU would have the capacity to undertake huge and complex tasksthe institution of this new democratization of economic development. This concept is to build diversified economic educational tropolis (edu-tropolis) in every designated school district with a university. Most of the universities will be super universities designed as the epicenter of the local economic free zone. The institution of the edu-tropolis will be a remarkable help to accelerate the modernization of infrastructure in the new ASU federal community, such as the initiative of wiring the entire new ASU federal society for high-speed Internet access and building the complex modern transportation infrastructure, the high-speed rails that crisscross between the edu-tropolis economic school district hubs in the entire new nation.
The introduction of the twenty-first-century democratic system, the centurys monoparty democratic system, would transform the African political landscape. Here are some of the basic principles: (1) no political party formation, (2) all political candidates register and campaign for public office solely under their respective individual names, (3) legally institute a fourth branch of government, the electoral branch of government.
The essential role of linguistic diversity in engineering the wealth of the new West African society is the introduction of the new twenty-first-century multilinguistic ideas and policies.
Set up a commission with the clear mission of creating a federal republic in West Africa through a peaceful, timely, and smooth process." />
