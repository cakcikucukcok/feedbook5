  <title>Athwart History: Half a Century of Polemics, Animadversions, and Illuminations - William F. Buckley Jr., Linda Bridges, Roger Kimball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;For most of the last century, William F. Buckley Jr. was the leading figure in the conservative movement in America. The magazine he founded in 1955, &lt;I&gt;National Review&lt;/I&gt;, brought together writers representing every strand of conservative thought, and refined those ideas over the decades that followed. Buckley&amp;#8217;s own writings were a significant part of this development. He was not a theoretician but a popularizer, someone who could bring conservative ideas to a vast audience through dazzling writing and lively wit.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Culled from millions of published words spanning nearly sixty years, &lt;I&gt;Athwart History: Half a Century of Polemics, Animadversions, and Illuminations&lt;/I&gt; offers Buckley&amp;#8217;s commentary on the American and international scenes, in areas ranging from Kremlinology to rock music. The subjects are widely varied, but there are common threads linking them all: a love for the Western tradition and its American manifestation; the belief that human beings thrive best in a free society; the conviction that such a society is worth defending at all costs; and an appreciation for the quirky individuality that free people inevitably develop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
