  <title>The Short Life of Free Georgia - Noeleen McIlvenna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For twenty years in the eighteenth century, Georgia--the last British colony in what became the United States--enjoyed a brief period of free labor, where workers were not enslaved and were paid. The Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia created a &quot;Georgia experiment&quot; of philanthropic enterprise and moral reform for poor white workers, though rebellious settlers were more interested in shaking off the British social system of deference to the upper class. Only a few elites in the colony actually desired the slave system, but those men, backed by expansionist South Carolina planters, used the laborers&#39; demands for high wages as examples of societal unrest. Through a campaign of disinformation in London, they argued for slavery, eventually   convincing the Trustees to abandon their experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Short Life of Free Georgia&lt;/i&gt;, Noeleen McIlvenna chronicles the years between 1732 and 1752 and challenges the conventional view that Georgia&#39;s colonial purpose was based on unworkable assumptions and utopian ideals. Rather, Georgia largely succeeded in its goals--until self-interested parties convinced England that Georgia had failed, leading to the colony&#39;s transformation into a replica of slaveholding South Carolina.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
