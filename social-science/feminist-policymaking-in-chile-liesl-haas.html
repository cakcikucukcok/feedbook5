  <title>Feminist Policymaking in Chile - Liesl Haas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The election of Michelle Bachelet as president of Chile in 2006 gave new impetus to the struggle in that country for legislation to improve women&amp;rsquo;s rights and highlighted a process that had already been under way for some time. In &lt;em&gt;Feminist Policymaking in Chile&lt;/em&gt;, Liesl Haas investigates the efforts of Chilean feminists to win policy reforms on a broad range of gender equity issues&amp;mdash;from labor and marriage laws, to educational opportunities, to health and reproductive rights. Between 1990 and 2008, sixty-three bills were put forward in the Chilean legislature as a result of pressure brought by the feminist movement and its allies. Haas examines all these bills, identifying the conditions under which feminist policymaking was most likely to succeed. In doing so, she develops a predictive theory of policy success that is broadly applicable to other Latin American countries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
