  <title>G.O.P. Damned America - D. A. Emert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I had rheumatic fever as a child. I read all I could find on my illness when I
was 14. I didnt like what I read. I might have had a different life if I didnt
read what I did. Ive done a lot of things in my life Im not proud of, but I
would only change one.
My guidance counselor in high school said I should think about becoming a school
teacher. I didnt even consider it. Later in life, I thought it would have been nice
to have summers off.
I would never have thought I would ever write a book. I went to welding school,
so I believe Im more qualified to write a book than Beck or Hannity. Ive got to
have a higher IQ. More important, I care about America." />
