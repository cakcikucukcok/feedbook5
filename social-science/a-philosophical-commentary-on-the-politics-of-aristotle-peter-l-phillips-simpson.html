  <title>A Philosophical Commentary on the Politics of Aristotle - Peter L. Phillips Simpson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The &lt;i&gt;Politics&lt;/i&gt;, Aristotle&#39;s classic work on the nature of political community, has been a touchstone of Western debates about society and government. In this volume, Peter Simpson presents a complete philosophical commentary on the &lt;i&gt;Politics&lt;/i&gt;, an analysis of the logical structure of the entire text and each of its constitutive arguments and conclusions.      Unlike other contemporary works on the &lt;i&gt;Politics&lt;/i&gt;, Simpson&#39;s philosophical commentary is not, save incidentally, a discussion of philological and historical questions, a speculative elaboration of Aristotle&#39;s arguments, or a comparison of the philosopher&#39;s ideas with those of other ancient and modern theorists. Such treatments, argues Simpson, must be grounded in a thorough understanding of the philosophical content of the work--a point that underscores the need for this thorough and accurate analysis.      Keyed to the ancient Greek text as well as to Simpson&#39;s own innovative translation of it (UNC Press, 1997), this book will stand as a valuable commentary on the philosophical argument in the &lt;i&gt;Politics&lt;/i&gt; and will serve as a sound basis for future study of Aristotle&#39;s political thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;!-- copy for pb reprint:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;A &#39;must read&#39; for scholars of the &lt;i&gt;Politics&lt;/i&gt;.--&lt;i&gt;Choice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;The entire edition is marked by a dashing boldness of judgment, and by confidence of tone and argumentation.--&lt;i&gt;Polis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;The commentary has many attractive features for the reader of Aristotle. All Greek is transliterated, and Bekker numbers are provided for easy cross-reference. Not least, it is written in clear and accessible prose. No reader of Aristotle&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Politics&lt;/i&gt; can ignore this important work.--&lt;i&gt;Classical World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Politics&lt;/i&gt;, Aristotle&#39;s classic work on the nature of political community, has been a touchstone of Western debates about society and government. Here, Peter Simpson presents a thorough analysis of the logical structure of the entire text and each of its constitutive arguments and conclusions. A valuable commentary on the philosophical argument in the &lt;i&gt;Politics&lt;/i&gt;, the book will also serve as a sound basis for future study of Aristotle&#39;s political thought. --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
