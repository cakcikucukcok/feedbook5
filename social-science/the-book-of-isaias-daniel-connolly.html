  <title>The Book of Isaias - Daniel Connolly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;**FIRST PLACE for the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Political/Current Affairs Book,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; International Latino Book Awards 2017**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;**One of &lt;i&gt;Southern Living&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Best Books of 2016**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;**OFFICIAL SELECTION: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;2017 Social Justice Book List published by The National Network of State Teachers of the Year (NNSTOY) o &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boston Public Library Latino Life Booklist o &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chicago Public Library Hispanic Heritage Month Booklist o &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Books for Welcoming Week by King County Library System (Washington State)**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A fast-paced nonfiction narrative that will help you understand today&#39;s immigration battles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;18-year-old high school senior Isaias Ramos plays in a punk rock group called Los Psychosis and likes to sing along to songs by Björk and her old band, the Sugarcubes. He&#39;s so bright that when his school&#39;s quiz bowl goes on local TV, he acts as captain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The counselors at school want him to apply to Harvard. But Isaias isn&#39;t so sure. He&#39;s thinking about going to work painting houses with his parents, who crossed the Arizona desert illegally from Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the obstacles and his own doubts, Isaias sets out on the journey to become the first in his family to go to college. He faces make-or-break standardized testing, immigration bureaucracy and absurdly high college costs. And most importantly, the siren song of doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simple story reflects broader truths. Mexican immigration has brought the proportion of Hispanics in the nation&#39;s youth population to roughly one in four. Every day, children of immigrants make decisions about their lives that will shape our society and economy for generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;Friday Night Lights&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Hope in the Unseen&lt;/i&gt;, this deeply human narrative offers a powerful antidote to the heated political rhetoric about immigrants and their children.&lt;/p&gt;" />
