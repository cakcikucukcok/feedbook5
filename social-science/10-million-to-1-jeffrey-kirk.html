  <title>10 Million to 1 - Jeffrey Kirk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They are coming. Who? Refugees. Every year, the President and Congress determine the arrival quota, the small percentage of refugees who will have a chance to start a new life in the United States during that year.
&lt;p&gt;
But just because theyre coming does not mean they are somehow lucky or that they are even going to make it in our land of opportunity.  To have the best shot at success, they need your help.
&lt;p&gt;
10 MILLION TO 1 is about the help, direction, and love you can provide to refugees as they arrive in our country and take their first steps toward self-sufficiency. 
&lt;p&gt;
This book describes how you, who have likely grown up in the comfort of America, can welcome a refugee family and get them started on the path to a new and prosperous life as contributing members of our society. 
&lt;p&gt;
You will discover all the steps you need, from meeting them upon arrival at the airport to getting them housing to finding them jobs.  Along the way, you will experience personal growth in ways you never imagined.
&lt;p&gt;
In time, you may witness the ultimate heartwarming outcome when you see the decision, the steps, and the fulfillment as former refugees become citizens of our great nation.  
&lt;p&gt;
Oh, yes, the world is a better place." />
