  <title>In a Rebellious Spirit - John P. Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A fresh view of the legal arguments leading to the American Revolution, this book argues that rebellious acts called &amp;quot;lawless&amp;quot; mob action by British authorities were sanctioned by &amp;quot;whig law&amp;quot; in the eyes of the colonists. Professor Reid also holds that leading historians have been misled by taking both sides&#39; forensic statements at face value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus is on three events. First was the Malcom Affair (1766), when a Boston merchant and his friends faced down a sheriff&#39;s party seeking smuggled goods, arguing that the search warrant was invalid. Second was a parade in Boston to celebrate the second anniversary (1768) of the repeal of the Stamp Act&amp;mdash;an occasion when some revenue officials were hanged in effigy. Third was the Liberty &amp;quot;riot&amp;quot; (1768), when customs officers boarded John Hancock&#39;s ship and were carried off by a crowd including the aforementioned Malcom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal inquires into the three events were marked by hyperbole on both sides. Whigs depicted Crown officials as lawless trespassers serving a foreign tyrant. Tories painted the Sons of Liberty as lawless mobs of almost savage ferocity. Both sides, as the author shows, had extralegal motives: whigs to enlist supporters in the other colonies for the cause of independence; tories to bring British troops and warships to Massachusetts in support of the status quo. Both succeeded in their polemical aims, and both have gulled most historians.&lt;/p&gt;" />
