  <title>Against the Fascist Creep - Alexander Reid Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;US&amp;#160;society is notoriously complacent when it comes to the rise of fascist tendencies. When Dylann Roof murdered nine black parishioners in a Charleston church, media emphasis remained superficial. Familiar narratives of insane lone wolves and Confederate flags masked the organizations that inspired Roof&#39;s act and their connections to politicians at the local, state, and federal levels throughout the South&amp;#8212;groups like the Council of Conservative Citizens (formerly the White Citizens Council).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scratch the surface of such groups and you&#39;ll find a web of complex ties and front groups created by fascist ideologues. Trace the connections further and further back and you find yourself moving from semi-respectable organizations through darker and darker levels of fascism and hatred.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fascism is not a euphemism here. A terrifying tour of the history and influence of international neo-fascists, &lt;i&gt;Against the Fascist Creep &lt;/I&gt;maps the connections and names the names, showing how infiltration is a conscious and secret program for white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups. Their activity has exploded since the economic crisis and they have stepped up efforts to influence both mainstream and radical groups, including anarchists.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is a line in the sand that both identifies the creep of fascist messages, ideas, and organization throughout our society and outlines how to stop it in its tracks. &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alexander Reid Ross &lt;/B&gt;is a contributing moderator of the &lt;i&gt;Earth First! Newswire&lt;/I&gt;. He is the editor of &lt;i&gt;Grabbing Back: Essays Against the Global Land Grab &lt;/I&gt;and a contributor to &lt;i&gt;Life During Wartime: Resisting Counterinsurgency&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;" />
