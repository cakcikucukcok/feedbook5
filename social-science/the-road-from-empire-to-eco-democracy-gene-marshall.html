  <title>The Road from Empire to Eco-Democracy - Gene Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An examination of Social Awakenment, History-Long Vision,
Holistic Social Understanding &amp; Strategies of Transformation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As viewed by five United States Citizens in 2011
Lead author &lt;b&gt;Gene Marshall with coauthors, Ben Ball, 
Marsha Buck, Ken Kreutziger, and Alan Richard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though vast changes are necessary, we believe humanity can find a vision and plan of action that is both satisfying and realistic. Our aim is to fertilize the fruitful imagination and courage it will require to walk this &lt;i&gt;Road to Eco-Democracy&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise, insightful, forthright, systemic, and clearly written, with moments of special brilliance. The framing of The Forces of Transformation and The Role and Limitations of Electoral Politics are particularly distinctive and useful contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Korten, author of &lt;i&gt;Agenda for a New Economy, The Great Turning From Empire to Earth Community, and When Corporations Rule the World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope &lt;i&gt;The Road&lt;/i&gt; is read and discussed by groups of friends and neighbors across the country. Sidestepping the political stalemates of the day, the authors name the basic problems facing our society, explain why taking the long view is crucial (but largely missing), and propose the processes by which we might create an eco-democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlene Spretnak, author of &lt;i&gt;Relational Reality, The Resurgence of the Real, 
and States of Grace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was enormously cheered by &lt;I&gt;The Road from Empire to Eco-Democracy&lt;/i&gt;, which sets out a comprehensive menu of todays myths and why they must be revisited. In contrast, these days Im often depressed, not so much by the disasters unfolding before eyes, but rather by un-integrated, non-systemic band-aid solutions, which have become public policy staples. &lt;i&gt;The Road&lt;/i&gt; neither trivializes the challenges nor tumbles into the trap of simplistic solutions. Yet beware, the many proposals in the book are neither trivial nor easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Sanborn Scott, Ph.D., Vice-President (for Americas) International Hydrogen Association, Founding Director, Institute for Integrated Energy Systems, Univ. of Victoria, Canada, author of &lt;i&gt;Smelling Land: The Hydrogen Defense Against Climate Catastrophe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
