  <title>Screwnomics - Rickey Gard Diamond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The personal is not only political, it’s also economic and sexual: as a society, we’re encouraged to view economics as objective science far removed from us—when in reality it has concrete and far-reaching effects on our everyday lives. 
&lt;br&gt;
In &lt;em&gt;Screwnomics&lt;/em&gt;, Rickey Gard Diamond shares personal stories, cartoons, and easy-to-understand economic definitions in her quest to explain the unspoken assumptions of 300 years of EconoMansplaining—the economic theory that women should always work for less, or better for free. It unpacks economic definitions, turns a men-only history on its head, and highlights female experiences and solutions. encouraging female readers to think about their own economic memoir and confront our system’s hyper-masculine identity. 
&lt;br&gt;
In the past fifty years, the US has witnessed a major shift in economic theory, and yet few women can identify or talk about its influence in their own lives. Accessible and inspiring, &lt;em&gt;Screwnomics&lt;/em&gt; offers female readers hope for a better, more inclusive future—and the tools to make that hope a reality." />
