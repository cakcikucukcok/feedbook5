  <title>The Dragon in the Room - Kevin Gallagher, Roberto Porzecanski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the eyes of many, China&#39;s unprecedented economic rise has brought nothing but good news to the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.  Indeed, China&#39;s growing appetite for primary products, and the ability of Latin America to supply that demand,  has played a role in restoring growth in Latin America, both in the run-up to the global financial crisis and in its aftermath.  
The dragon in the room that few are talking about is the fact that China is simultaneously out-competing Latin American manufacturers in world markets—so much so that it may threaten the ability of the region to generate long-term economic growth.  One of the authors&#39; key claims is that China is rapidly building the technological capabilities necessary for industrial development, whereas Latin American tech innovation and sophistication lags considerably. At a deeper level, the findings in this volume imply that China&#39;s road to globalization, one that emphasizes gradualism and coordinated macro-economic and industrial policies, is far superior to the &quot;Washington Consensus&quot; route taken by most Latin American nations, particularly Mexico." />
