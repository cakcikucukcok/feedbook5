  <title>Bloodthirsty Bitches and Pious Pimps of Power - Gerry Spence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ann Coulter. Laura Ingraham. Nancy Grace. Bill O&#39;Reilly. Sean Hannity. Pat Robertson.&lt;br&gt;Their faces and voices are ubiquitous: the shrill shrieks and strident bellowings that drown out all debate and set every listener on edge, using God&#39;s and Jesus&#39;s names to justify oppression and ignorance, and spread falsehoods as if they were facts. They occupy the bully pulpit of the new American hate culture: the television and radio programs watched and heard by millions of people that shape the opinions and set the agendas of churches, school boards, political action groups, and ultimately those we have elected to represent all of us. &lt;br&gt;Gerry Spence takes dead aim at the media demagogues who wield their power with such virulent effect. Using the full force of his own rhetorical skill--developed through decades as a legendary defense attorney--Spence exposes the people behind the words, and carves their arguments with the rough edge of his tongue. Anyone who has had it up to here will cheer to see these bullies met and conquered on their own turf.&lt;/p&gt;" />
