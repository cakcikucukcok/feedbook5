  <title>Black Pandering - Charles G. Ankrom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Defeat the ugly monster of racism by taking a candid look at race relations and changing the dialogue that is typical in society.
Slogans such as Black Lives Matter and Hands Up, Dont Shoot dominate the news, but the likes of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown are hardly poster boys for a new civil rights movement.
The silent white majority is tired of dealing with blacks who look, talk, and act like Browns stepfather. The moment after the grand jury decided not to indict the police officer who fatally shot his son, he vehemently urged onlookers to burn this bitch down.
Charles G. Ankrom takes a candid look at race relations in an effort to defeat the ugly monster of racism. He considers questions such as:
Why is it always presumed that whites discriminate against blacks when a cry of racism is heard? And why are these stories so prevalent in todays media? 
Why do hate crimes seem only to get filed against whites even though blacks constantly assault whites with cries of Justice for Trayvon and Remember Michael Brown?
Why does society pander to blacks with things such as Black History Month?
Consider tough questions, and change the dialogue on race in America with the insights in Black Pandering." />
