  <title>The Secure Urbanite: Personal Security in the Asphalt and Concrete Jungle - Jim Wygand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Roughly 80% of the world&#39;s population now lives in urban areas. Cities offer anonymity to violent criminals as well as to those who value privacy. New digital technologies allow purveyors of hatred and assorted smut to enter our homes and pedophiles use the Internet to bait our children and victimize them. This book is designed to provide you with a tested methodology for being secure in the concrete jungle without slipping into paranoia or denial. You don&#39;t have to be a just another crime statistic!  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Jim Wygand has provided seminars on personal security to companies, diplomats, government security personnel, schools, families and individuals for the past 18 years. He has been involved in the negotiation of several kidnaps and has written numerous articles and monographs on the issue of personal security. His method for avoiding violent crime is based on the same techniques employed by law enforcement, CIA, FBI, diplomatic and military personnel, to recognize and deal with possible danger. He has a strong personal reason for writing this book and he wants YOU and YOUR FAMILY to be safe. Jim Wygand is also the author of a novel entitled &lt;i&gt;The Story of Charlie Mullins: The Man in the Middle&lt;/i&gt;." />
