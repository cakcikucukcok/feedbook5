  <title>E Pluribus Unum - Cesar Fabiani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book describes the importance of America being unitede pluribus unumaccording the original US motto. It contrasts what happened in the United States with the rest of the Americas. The United States, because of its manifest destiny or exceptionalism, one common language, and immigration assimilation, is a nation that, because of its union, should be emulated.
Following geographical distribution, only three Americas should exist: North America (Canada, United States, and Mexico), Central America, and South America, which could be seen in figure 3. It starts with the United States of North America; the English colony; the American Revolution in 1776; its founding father, George Washington; and Abraham Lincoln. Then more recently, Barack Obama and Donald J. Trump are reviewed as well as their titanic efforts to maintain the union. This union was achieved after the original thirteen colonies were expanded with the Mexican-American war, the purchase of Louisiana and Florida, and the annexation of Alaska, Texas, and Hawaii. It triplicated its surface size. It is the third largest country in the world at 9,826,675 square kilometers.
As a contrast in Latin America with rampant division, more than twenty countries were founded. Efforts to unite Central America, the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, and the South American Free Countries (Federal League of the Free Countries) have been unsuccessful with many caudillos and heroes like Marti, Bolivar, Artigas, Juana Azurduy de Padilla, OHiggins, and San Martin, whose efforts have unfortunately been a failure. Many revolutions, civil wars, and corruption among its presidents, such as Cristina Kirchner, Evo Morales, and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, have eroded the rest of the Americas.
In the USA, the common language and the embrace of a multicultural nation with exceptionalism manifest destiny has been the formula of success. Two parties, Republicans and Democrats, vs. many parties in the rest of the Americas have contributed to the preservation of the union. This country has been successful in maintaining the union, but not without severe and sanguineous experiences such as the civil war and the abolition of slavery with 750, 000 deaths when the Confederate States of America existed from 1861 to 1865. Now the challenge remains. Will Donald J. Trump maintain the union and resolve the division that until now still exists? Time will tell." />
