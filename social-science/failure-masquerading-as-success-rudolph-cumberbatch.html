  <title>Failure Masquerading as Success - Rudolph Cumberbatch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Lincoln in 1865 said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote was later adapted as the VAs motto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; General Omar N Bradleys VA Mission Statement We are dealing with veterans, not procedures- with their problems, not ours has been quoted repeatedly during the seventy five years since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In 1982 President Reagan approved $55.6 million in financial aid toMeharryMedicalCollege. An acute care facility was established atMurfreesboroVAfor training Meharry students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bob Stump [Rep, Arizona], the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, recently heard that, in some VAs, incompetent managers are not fired on the spot, but instead, reassigned or transferred.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix was the immediate removal of Konik as the failed director at theSalisburyVAand recycling him as our new director in the summer of 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. On Tuesday April 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1998, an E-Mail was disseminated with following quotation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weak leadership at the York VA Medical Center has prompted changes in the hospitals administration staff, with hospital Director Gene Konik reportedly asking for reassignment, VA officials said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Mr. Dandridge began to initiate his long-term plan for integratingMurfreesboroandNashvilleVA.One of his famous quotations was: Practice, practice makes perfect. Another of his public quotations was: Having theNashvilleVAsurgical residents perform the surgery would provide world-class surgery to the area veterans. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; In the last five years, York has seen four different directors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gordons office has been bombarded with complaints from ailing veterans and their families about lack luster care. Those whove died as a result of the administrative and service changes cant complain anymore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current York VA Director David Pennington has never spoken to the press about anything, but did send a memo to the medical staff warning them to get online or get out!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our last crop of veterans is dying because of VA medical mismanagement, and our next batch is being loaded onto airplanes to fly back to an uncertain future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Sullivan, a gulf War I vet and VA project manager stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This administration is so absolutely corrupt, incompetent and malevolent; it pales anything that came before it. Why is our economy tanking? The war, the war, the war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
