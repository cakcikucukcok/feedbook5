  <title>Political Science Revitalized - Michael Haas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Political science has been described as a jigsaw puzzle with many specializations and subfields that do not talk to one another. This book offers a solution that will advance the field from mid-level theory to engage in cross-fertilization through metatheoretical paradigms. The book begins with a history of political science from the nineteenth century to the present, followed by a paradigmatic history of political science including 6 metatheories in the pre-behavioral era, 12 in the behavioral era, and the 4 major and several minor paradigms being developed today. The book advances the goal of David Easton by proposing a neobehavioral political science including multimethodological innovations, cross-testing of paradigms, and tenets of a new political science that can rise to become a truly theoretical science. Each paradigm is diagramed to demonstrate the key concepts and their causal interconnections. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Political Science Revitalized: Filling the Jigsaw Puzzle with Paradigms &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;poses an exciting and provocative argument for the future of the vast field of political science.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
