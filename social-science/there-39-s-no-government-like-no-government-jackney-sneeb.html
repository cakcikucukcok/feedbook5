  <title>There&#39;s No Government Like No Government - Jackney Sneeb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;There&#39;s No Government Like No Government&lt;/U&gt; celebrates the belief in the human spirit unmolested by state-worship.  It extols the value of individual judgment, based on perceptions, experience, and reason, and in the process derisively mocks the mindless blind faith in the inherent righteousness of the law.  It excoriates the belief that politicians ought to have, or even could have, the ability to alter morality simply by scribbling some words on a piece of paper.
&lt;P&gt;It offers a systematic approach to debunking the myth of the state using a logical analysis of the concept of &quot;government,&quot; in tandem with extracts of debates between the defenders of liberty and various authoritarians.  The sheep themselves reveal the bogus nature of the supposed authority of all rulers, be they elected democratically or chosen otherwise, in their downright insane descriptions of &quot;government.&quot;  Variously described as &quot;General Motors,&quot; or &quot;a group of people we elect to guarantee our rights,&quot; or the agency that &quot;doesn&#39;t have to be morally correct - that&#39;s why it is government,&quot; the insane belief deserves to be smashed, and this book is dedicated to doing exactly that.
&lt;P&gt;Keep it on your coffee table, in plain sight for all the state-worshipping control freaks to see, to be used as your answer when asked, &quot;Who did you vote for?&quot;" />
