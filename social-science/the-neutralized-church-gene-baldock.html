  <title>The Neutralized Church - Gene Baldock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Does the Bible teach Christians to avoid politics, as many claim? We are watching the greatness of America disappear and immorality is thriving.  We are taught this is &quot;God&#39;s will&quot;. A variety of scriptures are used to support this teaching but are they taught in context?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book does a very indepth study of these scriptures and argues that it is Satan, not God, who desires that Christians avoid politics.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this book is to show four satanic lies that the church is embracing. Politics is, in The United States, a means of performing our Christian mandate of being salt and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan alone benefits from Christians not being involved in politics. He has crafted a deception that will permit him to build his coveted one world tyranny by neutralizing the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe this country was founded by Christians you cannot accept that it is wrong for Christians to be involved today.  .&lt;/p&gt;" />
