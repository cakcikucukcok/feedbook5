  <title>The Charm of Latin America - Vito Tanzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the last four decades, Dr. Vito Tanzi traveled frequently to Latin America in his professional capacity as an economist working for the International Monetary Fund and for other international organizations. During many trips, he observed ongoing economic and political developments, but, was also fascinated by the culture, history, and beauty of the region. &lt;p&gt;
He believes that books written about Latin America dont often convey the vitality, beauty, and diversity of the region. Therefore, he decided to write a book based upon his own observations and memories from his travels and work in several countries of Latin America.&lt;p&gt;
The Charm of Latin America transcends economics and provides a more complete and lively portrait of these countries bursting with humanity. He captures cultural, visual, economic, and some of the historical aspects of Latin America. Entertaining and informative, the book covers five important countries: Brazil, Peru, Chile, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. Whether taken along on a trip to the region, or, simply enjoyed in the comfort of one&#39;s own house, The Charm of Latin America will bring the beauty and culture of this beautiful region to life!" />
