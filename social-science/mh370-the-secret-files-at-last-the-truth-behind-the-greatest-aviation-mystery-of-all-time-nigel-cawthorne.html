  <title>MH370 The Secret Files - At Last…The Truth Behind the Greatest Aviation Mystery of All Time - Nigel Cawthorne</title>

LESS THAN AN HOUR AFTER TAKEOFF, SOMEWHERE OVER THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, THE PLANE SIMPLY VANISHED. ONE EYEWITNESS SAW A BURNING PLANE CRASH INTO THE SEA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But confusing radar signals tracked an aircraft taking an erratic course across the Malaysian peninsula, then on to the Andaman Sea.
