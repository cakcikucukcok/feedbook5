  <title>Khap Panchayat, Women and Honour Killing - Dr Deepa Awasthi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This knowledge based edited book titled &#39;Khap Panchayat, Women and Honour Killing&#39; is collection of 20 chapters categorised in to 04 sections A) Understanding the Khap Panchayats, B) Khap Panchayats and Discrimination against Women, C) Khap Panchayats, Honour Crime and Laws, D) Khap and other Non State Agencies. The chapters included in the book has been written by eminent scholars after extensive research, with the intention to provide complete information to its readers about the khaps- their origin, expansion, constitution, ideology, legality, challanges created by them and about their dispute resolving machinery known as khap panchayats. These khap panchayats attracted the attention of media due to their verdicts promoting various types of honour crimes including honour killing. This book also focuses on the issue of brutal killing of couples residing in khap affected areas and opt for inter caste, inter religious and sagotra marriages. I hope this timely effort, first of its kind would be liked by the readers." />
