  <title>An End to Suffering - Pankaj Mishra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An End to Suffering&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply original and provocative book about the Buddha&#39;s life and his influence throughout history, told in the form of the author&#39;s search to understand the Buddha&#39;s relevance in a world where class oppression and religious violence are rife, and where poverty and terrorism cast a long, constant shadow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mishra describes his restless journeys into India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, among Islamists and the emerging Hindu middle class, looking for this most enigmatic of religious figures, exploring  the myths and places of the Buddha&#39;s life, and discussing Western explorers&#39; &quot;discovery&quot; of Buddhism in the nineteenth century. He also considers the impact of Buddhist ideas on such modern politicians as Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he reflects on his travels and on his own past, Mishra shows how the Buddha wrestled with problems of personal identity, alienation, and suffering in his own, no less bewildering, times. In the process Mishra discovers the living meaning of the Buddha&#39;s teaching, in the world and for himself. The result is the most three-dimensional, convincing book on the Buddha that we have.&lt;/p&gt;" />
