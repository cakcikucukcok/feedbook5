  <title>When Things Start to Think - Neil Gershenfeld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;When Things Start to Think&lt;/i&gt;, Neil Gershenfeld tells the story of his Things that Think group at MIT&#39;s Media Lab, the group of innovative scientists and researchers dedicated to integrating digital technology into the fabric of our lives.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gershenfeld offers a glimpse at the brave new post-computerized world, where microchips work for us instead of against us. He argues that we waste the potential of the microchip when we confine it to a box on our desk: the real electronic revolution will come when computers have all but disappeared into the walls around us. Imagine a digital book that looks like a traditional book printed on paper and is pleasant to read in bed but has all the mutability of a screen display. How about a personal fabricator that can organize digitized atoms into anything you want, or a musical keyboard that can be woven into a denim jacket? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Things Start to Think&lt;/i&gt; is a book for people who want to know what the future is going to look like, and for people who want to know how to create the future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
