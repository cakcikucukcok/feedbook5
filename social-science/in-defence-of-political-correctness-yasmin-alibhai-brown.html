  <title>In Defence of Political Correctness - Yasmin Alibhai-Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Individual rights cannot always take precedence over collective, social responsibility. Without self-moderation, parks, streets, school-yards, public transport, waiting rooms, shops and restaurants would turn into bear pits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most citizens understand that. Some, however, seem determined to cause disorder in the name of free speech.  Powerful, machiavellian and wealthy individuals are leading this disruption and breaking the old consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US and UK, anti-political correctness has gone mad. Invective, lies, hate speech, bullying, intemperance and prejudice have become the new norms. Intolerance is justified through invocations of liberty. Restraint is oppression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new order has been established in which racism, sexism,  homophobia and xenophobia are proudly expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new barbarians must be pushed back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book traces the history of political correctness in the US and UK and forcefully argues that, in spite of many failures, this movement has made both countries more civilised and equal.&lt;/p&gt;" />
