  <title>Giving Back Childhood - The Children’s Hospital Trust</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Description Have you ever stopped what you were doing as an aroma transported you back to your grandmother&#39;s kitchen or took you to a time and place so special from your childhood that you treasure it in your heart for ever? In Giving Back Childhood, celebrities from the world of sport, music, media, academia, business, politics, literature, food and entertainment, as well as unsung heroes at the Red Cross War Memorial Children&#39;s Hospital, share some of their own personal memories of food and childhood, as well as the recipes that are the on-going connection to those memories. To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Red Cross War Memorial Children&#39;s Hospital in Cape Town, this book of memories and recipes offers you the opportunity to contribute to the outstanding and life-saving medical treatment that the Hospital provides on a daily basis to the children of Southern Africa and many other countries on the African continent. Without the generosity of donors and the general public, much of this work would simply not be possible. All children need to dream, they need hope for the future - and for that they need good health. By purchasing this book, you can help to give the young patients of this Hospital their childhood back." />
