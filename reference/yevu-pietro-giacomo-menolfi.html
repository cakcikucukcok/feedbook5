      <meta name="description" content="YEVU: ruthlessness on the aid system
Yevu is a kind of diary of a volunteer doctor in Africa, with a personal analysis of the problems of the Third World. The author uses a concise language, generating somethinng like a report direcly coming from the field.
Through the paper, the book is trying to enhance images in the reader’s mind. One can clearly get the author&#39;s sincere passion for the subject. The content is innovative in its field . It is a work of a good standard,maybe a bit redundant in the presentation. It offers a pleasant reading dense of descriptions of places, people and traditions. The book may be of interest for casual readers due to the passionate stories close to the true life. It can be a book where the specialist readers can find a well of novelties.
The book describes the reality of the AID system from an unusual point of view, from a direct observation, with a realistic ruthlessness, borne from a decade of volunteering in Africa.
The doctor carries within himself many disappointments and disillusionments that switch a light on the world of volunteering which seems to be in an obscure oblivion.
The book is based on indisputable facts. The story opens some windows to the readers who have the opportunity to make their own conclusions." />
