  <title>Early Retirement: a Roadmap to Success - Joe Thomas Potuzak Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Having retired early in life at the age of 45, back in the late 80&#39;s, has been very advantageous to me.  It gave  me the time to devote many thousands of hours to this project and it should be very beneficial to you, as a reader. This book illustrates what has worked very profitably for me in the past and continues to work profitably to this day. In this book, there are valuable tips and some good sound financial and fundamental information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As President of three Corporations and three companies, from 1965 to present day, it has kept me quite busy over time. In the 90&#39;s, as Owner, Producer, Director, and Host of a popular Radio Travel Show in southwest Florida, I was quite content. At the time, I felt I had done quite a bit in my life, but I also felt one project was missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been asked many times, how I retired so young, and how I achieved my success in life. So one day in 2004, I said to myself why not sit down and write about it, hence this book. I do say at times, I am really in semi-retirement, very busy having fun. This book was written with good intentions, morals, and family values. As you read on, it is for all to enjoy, from ages 9 to 90. Early Retirement: A Road Map to Success is a timeless book.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
