  <title>Shema (Hear) O Israel and the Church - Cynthia Rich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Did you know that the Old Testament is rich in parallels, types, and shadow pictures of Jesus? For instance, did you know that the High Priest described in the Old Testament is a type and shadow picture of Jesus as our High Priest? Another example of a type and shadow picture is the Passover lamb. In the OT, the Israelites who put the blood of the lamb on their doorpost were saved. Did you know that Jesus is our Passover lamb (1 Corinthians 5:7)? Understanding these parallels, types, and shadows can give us a greater understanding of the New Testament and what Jesus has done for us. What does this mean for the church today? What does it mean for you and me?
This book is designed to show parallel scriptures in the Old and New Testament and what those scriptures mean for us.
The author hopes to reconnect the church to her Hebraic roots and share with the Jewish community types and shadows of their Messiah (Yeshua), Jesus, in the Old and New Testament." />
