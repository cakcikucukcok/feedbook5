  <title>Hesiod: Quotes &amp; Facts - Blago Kirov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an anthology of quotes from Hesiod and selected facts about Hesiod.   &quot;Acquisition means life to miserable mortals.&quot; &quot;Actions from youth, advice from the middle-aged, prayers from the aged.&quot; &quot;Do not let any sweet-talking woman beguile your good sense with the fascinations of her shape. It&#39;s your barn she&#39;s after.&quot; &quot;Do not seek evil gains; evil gains are the equivalent of disaster.&quot;  &quot;For a man wins nothing better than a good wife, and then again nothing deadlier than a bad one.&quot;  &quot;Giving is good, but taking is bad and brings death.&quot;  &quot;Happy is the man whom the Muses love: sweet speech flows from his mouth.&quot;  &quot;He is a fool who tries to match his strength with the stronger. He will lose his battle, and with the shame will be hurt also.&quot; &quot;If you should put even a little on a little and should do this often, soon this would become big.&quot; &quot;It is not possible either to trick or escape the mind of Zeus.&quot; &quot;It will not always be summer; build barns.&quot;" />
