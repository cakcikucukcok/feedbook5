  <title>It&#39;s Worth Doing - P. Reed Maurer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s Worth Doing is a must read for anyone engaged in cross-border dealings with Japan in the pharmaceutical industry. This book offers a wealth of insight that you will find invaluable whether you are a veteran Japan hand or new to the nation, whether you are a senior executive or a newly hired medical representative.
P. Reed Maurer shares his decades of experience and expertise through brilliantly penned colums that are always interesting, frequently funny, and sometimes--as in the title piece--gripping. In succinct and thoroughly enjoyable prose, Maurer imparts the esence of what you will need to know to succeed in Japan.
The columns collected in this volume provide a sweeping historical perspective on Japan&#39;s pharmaceutical industry and an inside view of how companies in that industry compete. They furnish practical hints about how to manage and motivate people effectively at pharmaceutical operations in Japan and how to build a strong corporate image there. Maurer exposes myths and misunderstandings about doing business in Japan, refuting them with an objective clarity that is a joy to read.
It&#39;s Worth Doing is even more, however, than a treasure trove of information and insight. True to its title, the book is a compelling reminder of why you are in the pharmaceutical business.
