  <title>Epic Fails - Salvador Jimenez Murguia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many of the most successful innovations&amp;mdash;from the light bulb to the Internet&amp;mdash;have often resulted from ingenuity, ambition, and dedication. Such achievements have changed lives for the better. Yet for every new development that the public embraces, there is a dark side of progress: cultural byproducts that litter the road to obscurity.

In order to shed light on the inherent, often comic strain in American life between fame and infamy, the author surveys some of the best&amp;mdash;or rather, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;worst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;mdash;of what man has to offer. From fashion flops like the mullet and Zubaz pants to marketing mistakes like Bud Dry, New Coke, and Crystal Pepsi, this text captures the unintentionally entertaining milieu of failure.
