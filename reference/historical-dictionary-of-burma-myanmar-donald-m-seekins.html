  <title>Historical Dictionary of Burma (Myanmar) - Donald M. Seekins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Burma (Myanmar) is a Southeast Asian country that is emerging from crisis after more than a half century of hard-line military rule and cultural, diplomatic and economic isolation. With the dissolution of its military regime, the State Peace and Development Council, in 2011, a formally civilian but military-dominated constitutional government was inaugurated. By 2012, Burma&amp;rsquo;s president, retired General Thein Sein, had established a working relationship with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the country&amp;rsquo;s pro-democracy movement since 1988, and after a 2012 by-election she and members of her opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), entered the new Union Parliament as legislators. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, even with the election victory of Daw Suu Kyi and the NLD in the General Election of November 2015, Burma faces daunting challenges: it is still one of the poorest countries in Southeast, fissured by longstanding ethnic conflicts that have made a nationwide peace agreement elusive and its people&amp;rsquo;s security and the environment are threatened by foreign economic exploitation. Religious discord is also widely evident, as Buddhist militants instigate violence against the country&amp;rsquo;s religious minorities, especially Muslims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today Burma&amp;rsquo;s prospects are the most hopeful they have been for over half a century, as the country takes steps along the road to a more open society and economy. This edition of the Historical Dictionary of Burma (Myanmar) encompasses not only current developments, but also Burma&amp;rsquo;s over 1,500 years-old recorded history and the most important features of its cultures, ethnicity, religions, society and economy. This is done through a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;chronology, an introduction, and an extensive bibliography. The dictionary section has over 700 cross-referenced entries on important personalities, politics, economy, foreign relations, religion, and culture. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
