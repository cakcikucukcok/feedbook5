Wilson</i></b> | Robert Anton Wilson is the grand pooh-bah of late-20th-century conspiracy theory, but regular Wilson fans may find Everything Is Under Control inchoate in comparison to such masterworks as the Illuminatus! trilogy. The format may be encyclopedic, but the information isn't; to note one glaring omission, the only entries on Ronald Reagan refer readers to three other entries in which Reagan is briefly mentioned--none of which has anything to do with Iran-Contra.<br /><b><i>Everything Is Under Control: Conspiracies, Cults, and ...</i></b> | Everything Is Under Control written with Miriam Joan Hill Available at Amazon.com. Mosbunall Robert Anton Wilson's books can be purchased at Amazon.com, and new editions will be republished by the RAW Trust's new publishing house Hilaritas Press.
