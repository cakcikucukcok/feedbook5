  <title>The Hill of Affluence - T. C. Tilden-Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Hill of Affluence is a reference book to help people make financial plans for their retirement. It links investment strategy to their level of contentment on the hill of affluence. Successful investors need to have a basic knowledge of politics and economics, and these subjects are covered in the first two chapters. The following chapters are concerned with property ownership, starting a business, and of course investment. The latter subject commences with the simplest form of saving, via bank deposits and government Treasury stocks, and advises when to switch from one to the other. It then moves on to investment trusts and unit trusts (or mutual funds, as they are known in America). These can be dealt in direct with the managers or by using the services of a stockbroker or financial advisor. In fact, investment trusts can only be dealt in by a broker, as their shares are quoted on a stock exchange.
A stockbroker can also advise you about investing in other shares and teach you about the vagaries of the stock market. Finally, you may be knowledgeable and brave enough to invest using the services of a dealing only broker. This book explains the unique Tilden theory of investment, which is applicable for investors all over the world.
