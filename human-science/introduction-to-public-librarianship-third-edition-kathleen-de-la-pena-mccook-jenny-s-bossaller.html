  <title>Introduction to Public Librarianship, Third Edition - Kathleen de la Pena McCook, Jenny S. Bossaller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Put simply, there is no text about public librarianship more rigorous or comprehensive than McCook&#39;s survey. Now, the REFORMA Lifetime Achievement Award-winning author has teamed up with noted public library scholar and advocate Bossaller to update and expand her work to incorporate the field&#39;s renewed emphasis on outcomes and transformation. This &quot;essential tool&quot; (Library Journal) remains the definitive handbook on this branch of the profession. It covers every aspect of the public library, from its earliest history through its current incarnation on the cutting edge of the information environment, including
    statistics, standards, planning, evaluations, and results;
    legal issues, funding, and politics;
    organization, administration, and staffing;
    all aspects of library technology, from structure and infrastructure to websites and makerspaces;
    adult services, youth services, and children&#39;s services;
    associations, state library agencies, and other professional organizations;
    global perspectives on public libraries; and
    advocacy, outreach, and human rights.
Exhaustively researched and expansive in its scope, this benchmark text continues to serve both LIS students and working professionals." />
