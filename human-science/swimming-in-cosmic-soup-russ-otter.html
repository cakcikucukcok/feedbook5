  <title>Swimming in Cosmic Soup - Russ Otter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Our cosmic soup is in an endless churn, changing the circumstances of events from moment to moment. Russ Otter swims in this cosmic soup every waking moment, to discover, learn, fail, and grow. In this, the second edition of his Swimming in Cosmic Soup, he shares his most recent discoveries and theories from his lifelong quest for understanding, truth, and peace.
This study provides a review of the scientific knowledge we have of our universe, presented in easy-to-understand terms, and a suggestion of what this might mean to us. It takes a look at religion from a new perspective, one in which all sentient people can enjoy a loving, religious life whose teachings are removed from human extrapolations, rituals, suppositions, and institutions. It also offers a pragmatic view of theocratic historiesand the fallout we are living with today as a result.
Otter presents an examinationusing responsibility, freedom, and ethicsof the politically correct culture that leaves no stone unturned for the mischief this is brought down upon society, along with a look at the nature of politics and the direction of his own politics, coupled with the ultimate force and value of humor.
In this study, Otter presents an engaging ride through philosophy, history, and science as he questions assumptions and the great unknowns of mystery, discovery, and hope." />
