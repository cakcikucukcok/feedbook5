      <meta name="description" content="Mental health professionals are often more comfortable and trained to run individual
and small group therapy but need training to handle larger groups. This book
demonstrates how learning to run larger groups can not only be exciting but also
highly therapeutic for all. Included are numerous testimonies from individuals who
have benefited from these workshops and examples of individual growth and healing.
Edward Lyons, LCSW, LLADC, LLS, Chief Clinical Offi cer and Executive Vice President
of Integrity House, Inc. states, I have seen countless numbers of our clients begin
to heal from deep emotional wounds through participation in Dr. Colemans groups.
Pastor Gennie Holt, Newark, NJ, says,  I have worked with Dr. Coleman for several
years in many types of groups. I have witnessed people saved from addictions,
anxieties, phobias, depression and other issues. I have even seen members of my
congregation energized and transformed. I have witnessed people come away from
his groups with greater faith, hope and courage." />
