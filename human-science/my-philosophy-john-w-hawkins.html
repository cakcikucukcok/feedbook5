  <title>My Philosophy - John W. Hawkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book consists of a series of essays written by the author following his retirement from Sun Oil Company (now renamed Sunoco) in the 1980s.  They are based on a life-changing experience by him at the age of 36 which showed him that all men and women are possessed of unlimited potential to achieve nearly anything that they  desire.  As a result of this experience he taught an adult education class for two years entitled Realize Your Potential.  As quoted on the dedication page to this book, God has made us but little lower than Himself and has placed all things under our feet. An earlier book was published by the author last year entitled What Manner of Man is This? about the life of Jesus.  Like St Paul the author agrees that all things work together for good for those who love God and who are called according to his purpose. (Romans 8:28)  and that we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us. (Philippians 4:13).  All of these essays as well as the chapters in his previous book may be found on his website at www.johnwhawkins.com.  His previous book may also be purchased by going to this website." />
