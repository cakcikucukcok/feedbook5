  <title>Community Journalism - Jock Lauterer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No matter how ambitious they may be, most novice journalists don&#39;t get their start at the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;. They get their first jobs at smaller local community newspapers that require a different style of reporting than the detached, impersonal approach expected of major international publications. As the primary textbook and sourcebook for the teaching and practice of local journalism and newspaper publishing in the United States, &lt;i&gt;Community Journalism&lt;/i&gt; addresses the issues a small-town newspaper writer or publisher is likely to face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jock Lauterer covers topics ranging from why community journalism is important and distinctive; to hints for reporting and writing with a &quot;community spin&quot;; to design, production, photojournalism, and staff management. This third edition introduces new chapters on adjusting to changing demographics in the community and &quot;best practices&quot; for community papers. Updated with fresh examples throughout and considering the newest technologies in editing and photography, this edition of &lt;i&gt;Community Journalism&lt;/i&gt; provides the very latest of what every person working at a small newspaper needs to know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
