  <title>Building a Virile Nation - Ausbeth Ajagu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Building a Virile Nation: The Private Sector Perspective presents a blueprint for every nation burdened by debilitating economic conditions and underdevelopment. It charts a course for sustainable economic development of nations as well as for propelling individuals to success in any endeavor. This collection is a major guide for governments and policy makers at all levels as well as budding and practicing business executives. It is expected that the readers shall be challenged, inspired, and empowered by some of the issues raised.
Ausbeth Ajagu is one of the Nations emerging influencers. Author of many thought-provoking books, his latest work, Building a Virile Nation: The Private Sector Perspective, is a comprehensive roadmap for a nation in search of robust economy like Nigeria. I have no doubt in my mind that this book will inspire many people in and outside of government.
Dr. Sunny Obazu-Ojeagbase, FAES, Chairman, Success Attitude Development Centre, Publishers of Success Digest
Dr. Ausbeth Ajagu is a prolific writer whose thoughts have covered all imaginable problems that any country in the process of building is likely to face. Given his wealth of experience, he attempts in Building a Virile Nation a systematic approach to harnessing the resources of a nation and galvanizing such to propel the country to a respectable status among the comity of nations. I commend his efforts and fully recommend this interesting book to the public and private sectors of the economy.
Engr. Godwin Omene, FNSE, FAES, Former Managing Director, NDDC 
Gods divine grace brings out that potential gift in us according to His purpose. Dr. Ajagu has written another incisive masterpiece for our generation. It runs in the family gene/blood to the glory of God in Jesus name, amen.
Engr. Cyril Ajagu, FAES (VC/GMD, Universal Insurance Group Plc.)
The authors masterpiece is for all classes of people. It is for all men and women in all tiers of government. Reading the book with a clear mind and intention will definitely improve the quality of delivery of states services. Practitioners in the private sector of our economy and those in the academia will find the book extremely useful.
