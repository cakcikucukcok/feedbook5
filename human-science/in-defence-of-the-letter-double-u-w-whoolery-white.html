  <title>In Defence of the Letter Double-U - W. Whoolery White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;W. Whoolery White never suspected that the letter Double-U  also known as W and dubyawould be the most interesting letter in the English language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by virtue of his name, he always felt a connection to the letter, and his experiences as an English teacher, library administrator, and newspaper reporter instilled in him a deep appreciation for the misunderstood letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He takes a humorous but informative approach in defending the letter, exploring questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Why do we have the same pronunciations for to, two, and too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	What words should include a W but dont?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Would using more Ws save letter space in our writings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	What would an English alphabet for the twenty-first century look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White blames the French for the Polish language ending up with too many consonants, and he argues that there is an ancient, worldwide conspiracy against the letter, which really should be written as a Double-U instead of a Double-V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a hilarious journey that will teach you things about the English language you had no idea you didnt know, including why we should all stand up In Defence of the Letter Double-U.&lt;/p&gt;" />
