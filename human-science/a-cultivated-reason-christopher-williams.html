  <title>A Cultivated Reason - Christopher Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Plato&amp;rsquo;s tripartite division of the soul, Descartes&amp;rsquo;s criterion of clear and distinct ideas, and Kant&amp;rsquo;s notion of the categorical imperative attest, philosophy has traditionally been wedded to rationalism and its &amp;ldquo;intellectualist&amp;rdquo; view of persons. In this book Christopher Williams seeks to wean his fellow philosophers away from an overly rationalistic self-understanding by using resources that are available within the philosophical tradition itself, including some that anticipate strands of Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book begins by developing Hume&amp;rsquo;s critique of rationalism, with reference especially to the section of the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; that deals with the continuing existence of bodies (an argument that subverts intellectualist criteria by attempting to satisfy them) and to his neglected essay &amp;ldquo;The Sceptic&amp;rdquo; where Hume reveals the importance of our embodiment through a comic portrayal of philosophers&amp;rsquo; efforts to &amp;ldquo;correct our sentiments.&amp;rdquo; Then it moves on to ward off charges of irrationalism by showing that, although our powers of self-correction are more limited than the rationalist thinks they are, a Humean position is able both to sustain a commitment to reflection and to sensitize us to a version of irrationalism, manifest in monotheistic theologies, that is otherwise difficult to detect. The book concludes, more speculatively, with a comparison of persons to artworks in order to show how our aesthetic dimension is the source of some of the normative work previously assigned to rationalist reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranging as it does across subfields from epistemology and history of philosophy to ethics and aesthetics, &lt;em&gt;A Cultivated Reason&lt;/em&gt; should appeal to a wide audience of philosophers and to scholars in other fields as well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
