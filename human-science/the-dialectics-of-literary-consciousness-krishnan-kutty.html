  <title>The Dialectics of Literary Consciousness - Krishnan Kutty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. K. P. Krishnan Kutty, a bilingual author, writes in Malayalam, his mother tongue, and in English. As a cultural activist and as a member of the Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishath, he campaigns for the propagation scientific temper and environmental values. 
A Sun and Many Realities (1989), Theviyundu Chirithookiyippozhum (2013) and K.Purathu Vakkaattu Kunhappu (2013) are his collections of poems. Nishedhikalude Guru (2007) and Enthanu Idathupaksha Bhavana? (2012) are two collections of essays in Malayalam. Jesus, I Am not a Christian, a collection of essays in English, was published in 2014. 
The present volume, the Dialectics of Literary Consciousness, is a collection of academic discussions on the processes of writing, reading, interpretation, and translation. Nature and Environment: Poetic Imprints of Shifting Perspectives, Matthew Arnold: The Voice and the Victim of Bourgeois Culture, The Dialectics of Interpretation: Aspects of Linguistic and Semantic Convergences, Barthes and Bakhtin: Monologic and Dialogic Searches for Meaning, The Reader and Sahrudaya, and The Political Philosophy of Translation are the essays included in this volume. They provide rational answers to the questions of literary creation and criticism. They are substantial contributions to Marxian literary aesthetics as they strive to substitute the misty abstractions of philosophical idealism with the lucid logic of dialectical and historical materialism." />
