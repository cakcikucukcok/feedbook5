  <title>Logic: A Very Short Introduction - Graham Priest</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Logic is often perceived as having little to do with the rest of philosophy, and even less to do with real life. In this lively and accessible introduction, Graham Priest shows how wrong this conception is. He explores the philosophical roots of the subject, explaining how modern formal logic deals with issues ranging from the existence of God and the reality of time to paradoxes of probability and decision theory. Along the way, the basics of formal logic are
explained in simple, non-technical terms, showing that logic is a powerful and exciting part of modern philosophy.
In this new edition Graham Priest expands his discussion to cover the subjects of algorithms and axioms, and proofs in mathematics.
