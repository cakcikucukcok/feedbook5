  <title>The Quality of Life - Richard Kraut</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Quality of Life: Aristotle Revised presents a philosophical theory about the constituents of human well-being. The principal idea is that what Aristotle calls &#39;external goods&#39; - wealth, reputation, power - have at most an indirect bearing on the quality of our lives. Starting with Aristotle&#39;s thoughts about this topic, Kraut increasingly modifies (and occasionally rejects) that stance. He argues that the way in which we experience the world is what
well-being consists in. A good internal life comprises, in part, pleasure but far more valuable  is the quality of our emotional, intellectual, social, and perceptual experiences. These offer the potential for a richer and deeper quality of life than that which is available to many other animals. A good human life
is immeasurably better than that of a simple creature that feels only the pleasures of nourishment; even if it felt pleasure for millions of years, human life would be superior. In opposition to contemporary discussions of well-being, which often appeal to a thought experiment devised by Robert Nozick, Kraut concludes that the quality of our lives consists entirely in the quality of our  experiences. While others hold that  we must live in &#39;the real world&#39; to live well and that one&#39;s interior
life has little or no value on its own, Kraut&#39;s interpretation of this thought experiment supports the opposite conclusion." />
