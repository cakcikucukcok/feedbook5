  <title>Viglets - Viggo P. Hansen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;VIGLETS Two - Ode to Dumbness&quot;  seeks to ease widespread global tensions resulting from dumb people, which includes everyone -  and is seemingly increasing exponentially. The author gently guides readers into creating personal dumb Viglets - intimate odes,  totally unrestricted by archaic rules of grammar - you simply let your emotions on dumbness &quot;hang out&quot; and get instant relief for your suffering psychic. 
&lt;p&gt;
Readers can easily relate to personal dumbness and find themselves creating insightfull Viglets worthy of sharing.  Issues like; drivers on cell phones, failing to signal, politicians whose only job seems to be get re-elected, professionals with alphabet soup titles and management styles are discussed.  What they all have in common is, you are right -  dumbness.  
&lt;p&gt;
Too often media (all of them) are loaded with lengthy - in depth - analysis scaring you into worrying about how your sewer pipes are leaking and our world is going to rack and ruin by having a drink or two.  Viglets cut to the chase with pithy ditties that express emotionally charged personal feelings about issues without in depth and breaking details.  Viglets bring a sense of calmness and balance even dummies can appreciate.&lt;br&gt;" />
