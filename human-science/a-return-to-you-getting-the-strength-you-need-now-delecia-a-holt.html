  <title>A Return to You-&quot;Getting the Strength You Need - Now&quot; - Delecia A. Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;H4&gt;Everything that we see, hear, smell, touch, taste, say, or do not say, has consequences. Four years of research, a lifetime of personal and collective experiences, and there is still more to do. I have observed one very important fact. That we, humans, tend to seek out others with similar beliefs, a similar &#39;base.&#39; With them we find a comfort zone. We tend to strive for that level point, that provides us comfort. Because at that level, we have no one to impress. They are on the same plane we are for the moment. &lt;P&gt;
That is until a life experience occurs, and one or both of us changes due to our belief systems formed within our &#39;base.&#39; Our &#39;bases&#39; influence every aspect of our lives, and the lives of those we interact with. We will explore this concept further in the book. &lt;P&gt;
For now, think of our &#39;base&#39; as the center of our physical and intellectual being. That place within the core of our spirits. Which provides us with the strength needed to survive all life&#39;s trials." />

Holt</i></b> | “May the light be in you forever, May the sun love you and keep you, May the dream make you awaken. For the stars love to shine upon you, And the heavens cry for your loss. May goodness and love flow through you once more, Drink of the light and the love here, Find that we all need you, May your spirit come back across.”<br /><b><i>Return Quotes (120 quotes) - Goodreads</i></b> | Fear is present when we forget that we are a part of God's divine design. Learning to experience authentic love means abandoning ego's insistence that you have much to fear and that you are in an unfriendly world. You can make the decision to be free from fear and doubt and return to the brilliant light of love that is always with you.<br /><b><i>1000 Return Quotes - Inspirational Quotes at BrainyQuote</i></b> | Have you ever thought how humiliating and distressing it was to be placed upon a sphere? For friendship it is a boon never to be able to be further apart than the antipodes. But suppose that you are leaving together to go on and on; it is impossible. To go beyond a certain point is to return to where you began.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>A Return to You-&quot;Getting the Strength You Need - Now&quot; - Delecia A.
