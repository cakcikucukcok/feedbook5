  <title>You&#39;ve Got a Book in You: A Stress-Free Guide to Writing the Book of Your Dreams - Elizabeth Sims</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Writing a book is fun and easy--yes, FUN AND EASY--but it may not always feel that way. How do you find the time to write? How do you keep momentum? How do you deal with the horror of showing anyone a single sentence of your work-in-progress? The answers remain fun and easy, and author Elizabeth Sims will take your hand, dispel your worries, and show you how it&#39;s done in this stress-free guide to accomplishing your dream of writing your book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;You&#39;ve Got a Book in You&lt;/i&gt;, Elizabeth is that encouraging voice guiding you through the entire process, from finding the right time and place to gathering all of your creative tools to diving right in and getting it done--page by page, step by step. It&#39;s easier than you think, and it all starts right here, right now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;This guide is witty, warm, and wise--and wonderfully down-to-earth as well. Elizabeth Sims doesn&#39;t just tell you that you&#39;ve got a book in you, she shows you how to pour it out using your own creative spirit, common sense, and persistence.&quot; ~&lt;b&gt;Lori L.

As she guides you from the creation of a &quot;working title&quot; through her (brilliant!) &quot;Making-It-Better Process,&quot; this well-established pro plays her most impressive cards--stacking the deck in favor of YOU!&quot; ~&lt;b&gt;Jamie Morris&lt;/b&gt;, Director, Woodstream Writers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Elizabeth Sims packs a twelve-week writing course into 280 pages.

As a seasoned writer, I appreciate the reminders about the importance of putting yourself on a writing schedule. No more excuses.

I especially enjoyed the section, &#39;Writing with the Masters.&#39; What better way to get inspired, get a feel for different styles, and get jump-started on your writing? Excellent advice that I plan to incorporate in my future classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I concur with Sims that &#39;writer&#39;s block&#39; is greatly exaggerated. Is there any other profession that claims such a phenomenon?  &#39;Excuse, me, but I have &#39;book-keeping block,&#39; &#39;playing music block,&#39; or &#39;painting block&#39; today?
