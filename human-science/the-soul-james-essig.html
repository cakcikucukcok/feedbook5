  <title>The Soul - James Essig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I thought that you as reader would enjoy this writing on the great dignity of the human soul. This book offers a sharp contrast to the main topics on which I tend to post and was written and compiled from my heart. I have often posted articles on extremely manned starship technologies, and as a physicist, I will continue to do such. However, I offer this rather long article as a sharing of my personal belief in the transcendent dignity of every human person and by corollary that of any of our ETI brothers and sisters.
With modern technological capabilities to monitor the various emotional and mental states of test subjects and the ability to measure and experimentally probe the electric and magnetic fields generated within the human body, we sometimes are tempted to view the human soul as some form of corruptible energy field. We long for a rekindling of a sense of mystery regarding the ephemeral reality of the human soul.
This book is motivated as an attempt to restore a sense of mystery in the minds and hearts of any and all persons who will read this post regarding that aspect of our human nature that seems to be beyond validation by modern science, technology, and medicine and which seems to defy certain and precise explanation by philosophers, theologians, and clergyman alike." />
