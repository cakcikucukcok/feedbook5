  <title>Meet Your Sexual Mind - Mark Abraham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Interactions Between Instinct and Intellect 
and its Impact on Human Behavior     &lt;br&gt;   Length: 200 Pages&lt;br&gt;
      The paradoxes of human sexuality although self-evident, have been difficult to explain through the conventional understanding of the human mind. A legitimate question to ask would be, if polygamy is natural for humans, then why are there so many rules against it worldwide?  And if humans by nature are monogamous, then, why is there so much infidelity in the all of the cultures of the world?  All beings instinctively are either polygamous or monogamous and they behave accordingly.  However, humans demonstrably are both at the same time.  This too, can only be understood through understanding the differences between the make up of human mind as compared to that of all the rest of the beings.  In that, except for humans, every aspect of all beings, including their sexual conduct is driven by their instincts and instincts alone.  This renders their mind a single polar entity, however, the human mind alone being equipped to both instincts and intellect is bipolar.  &lt;br&gt;
As such, each of these two mental forces of instincts and intellect issues its own command pertaining to human sexuality.  It just so happens that humans are instinctively polygamous, however, through the application of human intellect and reasoning and for practical reasons for millennia they have devised harsh rules against free sex to regulate peoples sexual activities through marriage.  These sever punishments are still enforced in many parts of the world even today.  And that was mostly designed to impose monogamy, although some societies also allowed polygamy.  Thus, instincts and intellect issue two opposite commands and that renders humans as the only species that is sexually confused.  This inner contradiction often leads to infidelity that severely affects the committed relationships among many couples.  The same phenomenon also creates a fascinating psychology of its own what is commonly known sexual fantasy.  Through this people in the privacy of their mind and in their imagination practice polygamy without committing adultery that partially satisfies both realms of the mind." />
