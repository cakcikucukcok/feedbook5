  <title>Decipher Your Clues - Andrew M. Bryant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am being what they call an incorrigible scamp
Under normal circumstances the very idea of speaking about myself would leave me a frantic wreck.  This however to me is not a normal circumstance. I am an open book if one could ever strike up the nerve to ask.    I like to understand the very deep consequences offending our answers.  Feeling through the situation in all its aspects tends to strike a certain terror in people that some are ill prepared for.  Life journies through us all.  We enter one another&#39;s lives only to depart in what seems like mere moments later.  This is all okay but the varied amount of emotion produced from such encounters leaves so many faltered.
The bound leather volume events of my life aspire me to become as only to what a dream could pronounce.  To say from known events and my reasons behind them tell two separate stories.  I would like to say that my life began when my first word hit paper but that would be a fallacy on my part.  I am shaped by my life before those moments in ways that I do not begin to comprehend.   I see these events and am left baffled by my outcome.  
Choosing how to live this brief time we get between what I was taught to be and by how I get it wrong and by getting it right, this was quite a decision.  By what one was taught or by what one learnt.
I am being what I feel is a happy person." />
