  <title>The Metaphysics of Truth - Douglas Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is truth? What role does truth play in the connections between language and the world? What is the relationship between truth and being? The Metaphysics of Truth tackles these fundamental philosophical questions and proposes a distinctive metaphysical worldview. Douglas Edwards develops a detailed pluralist theory, which holds that there are different relationships between language and the world in different subject areas, or &#39;domains&#39;. He explains what
domains are; how different domains are individuated; which metaphysical frameworks apply in different domains; and how a pluralist view of truth plays a key role. The connections between truth and being are explored, yielding a form of ontological pluralism-the idea that there are different ways of
being-which increases the explanatory power of the view. This project is carried out in a climate where the traditionally central issue of the nature of truth has diminished in significance due to the rise of deflationary and primitivist views, which deny that there are interesting and informative things to say about truth. Edwards responds to these views, and demonstrates the importance of the metaphysics of truth with regard to both the study of truth itself, and metaphysical debates more
generally. Moreover, Edwards pays particular attention to domains which have not been given much consideration in debates about truth, namely the institutional and social domains, and connects work on the metaphysics of truth and being to key issues in social construction." />
