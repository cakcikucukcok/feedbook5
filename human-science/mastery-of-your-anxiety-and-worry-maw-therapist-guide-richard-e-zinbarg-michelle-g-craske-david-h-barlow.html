The therapeutic technique described in this book is research-based with a proven success rate when used in both individual and group formats, as well as with clients currently taking medication. Designed to be used in conjunction with its corresponding workbook, this therapist guide outlines a 10-session program comprised of four primary treatment modules including, cognitive restructuring, progressive muscle relaxation, worry exposures, and in vivo exposure exercises. New features to this edition include expanded chapters that provide detailed instructions for conducting each session, session outlines, and recommended homework assignments.
