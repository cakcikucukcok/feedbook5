  <title>The Spiritual Guide: Four Steps on the Path of Enlightenment - Richard White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many people ask, &quot;How can I live a more spiritual life, a life that can ultimately lead to enlightenment?&quot; And by way of an answer this book describes four of the most important steps that we can take along the spiritual path--staying open to suffering, living a generous life, cultivating mindfulness and wonder, and accepting death but affirming joy. The Spiritual Guide offers a clear discussion of basic spiritual themes. It does not assume the truth of any given standpoint, and it has something to say to all people, regardless of their religious affiliation or lack of it. Most of us are profoundly concerned with meaning-of-life issues, but academic philosophy is remote while &quot;new age&quot; spirituality can be impossibly vague. This book uses parables, philosophical ideas, and stories from a variety of religious and philosophical traditions to illuminate what it means to live in a spiritual way. The Spiritual Guide is both practical and theoretical, and it speaks directly to readers as students of life." />
