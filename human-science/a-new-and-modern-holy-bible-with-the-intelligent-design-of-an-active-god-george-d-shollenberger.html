  <title>A New and Modern Holy Bible with the Intelligent Design of an Active God - George D. Shollenberger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK
&lt;p&gt;The general purpose of this book is to build the minds of all Little Gods, who were created by God, who also created the universe. About 4.4 million years ago, Little Gods appeared on planet earth. Today, billions of Little Gods exist and have developed their minds after they found that God and the universe have no end. However, the minds of all Little Gods did not develop until counting tokens appeared about 9,000 years ago. Then, 5000 years later, the Little Gods added symbols to these tokens. These symbols were used in early texts and later in national languages, religious scriptures, scientific books, newspapers, etc. For the last 4000 years, many religious leaders were saying that the symbols in scriptures are sacred and are inspired by God. In 2006, I found that God is infinite and unlimited. Six years later,
I found that symbols are finite and limited. These findings prove that scriptures cannot be sacred. I confirmed these findings with new research on Greek writings and the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament. In time, I expect all Little Gods to worship the same God. The purpose of my book is thus to bring all Little Gods together under one God. &lt;/p&gt;" />
