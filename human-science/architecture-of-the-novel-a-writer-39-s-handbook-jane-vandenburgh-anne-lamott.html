  <title>Architecture of the Novel: A Writer&#39;s Handbook - Jane Vandenburgh, Anne Lamott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Jane Vandenburgh, the author of two highly acclaimed novels and a recent memoir, offers aspiring writers the tools to create powerful and unique novels filled not only with good writing but also dynamic storytelling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Architecture of the Novel&lt;/I&gt; is an ambitious blueprint for writers, one that reveals the underlying machinery that propels a plot that is dynamic, coherent, and interesting.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Architecture of the Novel&lt;/I&gt; derives from the many years Vandenburgh has spent teaching the craft of fiction writing. Her method points to the elemental nature of narrative: A story consists of its events, which are told in scenes. These scenes naturally place themselves along the arc of the story in an order that provides suspense and mystery, drawing characters toward the inevitability of their fictive destinies.&lt;BR&gt;Profoundly practical yet encouraging to writers at all levels, &lt;I&gt;Architecture of the Novel&lt;/I&gt; offers the maps and mechanics to successfully guide writers toward the story that must be told.&lt;/div&gt;" />
