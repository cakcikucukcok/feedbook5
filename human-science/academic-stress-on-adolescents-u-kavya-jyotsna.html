  <title>Academic Stress on Adolescents - U. Kavya Jyotsna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stress and anxiety in children and teenagers are just as prevalent as in adults. Stressful and negligent parents, high expectations in academic or other performances, abused or deprived childhood, growing up tensions and demand for familial responsibilities are the main causes of childhood and teenage stress. Parents, who are not emotionally available for their children or lack of positive coping mechanisms themselves, often spur stress in their offspring. Stressed children show sign of emotional disabilities, aggressive behavior, shyness, social phobia and often lack of interest in otherwise enjoyable activities. Children as often ill equipped to cope with stress during their transition from a child to pre- adolescence and from pre-adolescence to adolescence phase. For pre-adolescence and teens, an identity crisis, the perils of peer interaction, acceptance and rejection of situation, persons and Ideas-are a constant source of teen stress and teenage depression. In this context the educationalist has taken into new dimensions on academic stress among adolescence. It is very healthy atmosphere for researchers, teachers and other stakeholders to look into the problems of adolescence&amp;#39;s and academic afresh. This volume focuses on several issues and implications off Academic stress on students. It is compilation of articles contributed by enthusiastic scholars and academicians in the field. It contains papers on major factors contributing to stress, approaches and attitudes that help relieve stress, consequences of stressful academic life, mental health, meditation and yoga and related matters. On the whole the volume contains papers that treat different aspects of academic stress. All papers provide necessary insights. It is my belief that this volume will be widely welcomed by all those concerned with this issue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
