  <title>Lacan&#39;s Clinical Technique - Antonio Quinet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do psychoanalysts act during analysis? When does treatment start? How long does a session or treatment last? How much does it cost? What does analytical interpretation entail? What is the final aim of analysis? These are the main issues Antonio Quinet addresses for clinical psychoanalysts and students in training.This is not a do-it-yourself book or a step-by-step manual for, but rather an examination of Freudian and Lacanian techniques based on psychoanalytical theory and ethics.The ideas examined are grounded in the structure of subjectivity, and the basic assumption that analysts have taken their own analysis to the end. It is from thereon that the will have the analysts desire as a practicla tool for their own clinical practice. Antonio Quinet&#39;s contribution regarding the start of treatment comes from his updated examination of Freudian concepts through Lacanian mathemes. This approach has made this books first version a best seller in Brazil, with over 30,000 copies sold.The author examines Freuds initial conditions: the trial period (renamed by Lacan as &quot;preliminary interviews&quot;), couch use, handlign of time, and treatment fees. Finallly, he describes and theorizes on what analysts do behind the couch: the act in the role of the semblant of object a and analytical interpretation.Lacans concept of semblant closely bonds theatre and the analytical act and his concept of lalangue does likewise with poetry and analytical interpretation. Quinet&#39;s approach closely reflect the relationship between psychoanalysis and performing arts." />
