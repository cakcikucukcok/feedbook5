  <title>Transparency and Self-Knowledge - Alex Byrne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alex Byrne sets out and defends a theory of self-knowledge-knowledge of one&#39;s mental states. Inspired by Gareth Evans&#39; discussion of self-knowledge in his The Varieties of Reference, the basic idea is that one comes to know that one is in a mental state M by an inference from a worldly or environmental premise to the conclusion that one is in M. (Typically the worldly premise will not be about anything mental.) The mind, on this account, is &#39;transparent&#39;:
self-knowledge is achieved by an &#39;outward glance&#39; at the corresponding tract of the world, not by an &#39;inward glance&#39; at one&#39;s own mind. Belief is the clearest case, with the inference being from &#39;p&#39; to &#39;I believe that p&#39;. One serious problem with this idea is that the inference seems terrible, because &#39;p&#39; is at
best very weak evidence that one believes that p. Another is that the idea seems not to generalize. For example, what is the worldly premise corresponding to &#39;I intend to do this&#39;, or &#39;I feel a pain&#39;? Byrne argues that both problems can be solved, and explains how the account covers perception, sensation, desire, intention, emotion, memory, imagination, and thought. The result is a unified theory of self-knowledge that explains the epistemic security of beliefs about one&#39;s mental states
(privileged access), as well as the fact that one has a special first-person way of knowing about one&#39;s mental states (peculiar access)." />
