  <title>Abracadabra - Shawn Gale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a simple guide to creative writing. With that said, anyone who reads it with an open mind, whether a beginner or advanced writer, will come away with something. All the basics you need to start writing today are shared in the following pages, from plot to settings to character development and then some. I have used both historical and contemporary examples to illustrate many of the lessons, while at the same time providing my own thoughts and insights.
And who am I, you may ask. I am someone who has been reading, writing, and publishing for years, while pluming the human condition. My life experiences, the good, the bad, and the ugly have afforded me a unique perspective. You can check out my author bio at the back and also visit my website for further details.
I encourage you to study this text, practice the lessons, and be inspired for that is the true spark of all creative works. If you work hard, you will improve. And if you work really hard and persevere, you might see your words in print someday. Like anything in life, the more you put into a pursuit, the more you will get out of it. I hope you enjoy!
There is so much to do." />
