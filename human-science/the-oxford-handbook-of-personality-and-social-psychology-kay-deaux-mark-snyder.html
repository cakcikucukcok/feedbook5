  <title>The Oxford Handbook of Personality and Social Psychology - Kay Deaux, Mark Snyder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The second edition of &lt;em&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Personality and Social Psychology &lt;/em&gt;beautifully captures the history, current status, and future prospects of personality and social psychology. Building on the successes and strengths of the first edition, this second edition of the &lt;em&gt;Handbook&lt;/em&gt; combines the two fields of personality and social psychology into a single, integrated volume, offering readers a unique and generative agenda for psychology.
Over their history, personality and social psychology have had varying relationships with each other-sometimes highly overlapping and intertwined, other times contrasting and competing. Edited by Kay Deaux and Mark Snyder, this &lt;em&gt;Handbook &lt;/em&gt;is dedicated to the proposition that personality and social psychology are best viewed in conjunction with one another and that the synergy to be gained from considering links between the two fields can do much to move both areas of research forward in order to better enrich our collective understanding of human nature.
Contributors to this &lt;em&gt;Handbook&lt;/em&gt; not only offer readers fascinating examples of work that cross the boundaries of personality and social psychology, but present their work in such a way that thinks deeply about the ways in which a unified social-personality perspective can provide us with a greater understanding of the phenomena that concern psychological investigators. The chapters of this &lt;em&gt;Handbook &lt;/em&gt;effortlessly weave together work from both disciplines, not only in areas of longstanding concern, but also in newly emerging fields of inquiry, addressing both distinctive contributions and common ground. In so doing, they offer compelling evidence for the power and the potential of an integrated approach to personality and social psychology today." />
