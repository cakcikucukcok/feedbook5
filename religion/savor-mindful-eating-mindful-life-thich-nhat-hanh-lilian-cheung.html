  <title>Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life - Thich Nhat Hanh, Lilian Cheung</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Common sense tells us that to lose weight, we must eat less and exercise more. But somehow we get stalled. We start on a weight-loss program with good intentions but cannot stay on track. Neither the countless fad diets, nor the annual spending of $50 billion on weight loss helps us feel better or lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too many of us are in a cycle of shame and guilt. We spend countless hours worrying about what we ate or if we exercised enough, blaming ourselves for actions that we can&#39;t undo. We are stuck in the past and unable to live in the present&amp;#8212;that moment in which we do have the power to make changes in our lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Savor&lt;/em&gt;, world-renowned Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh and Harvard nutritionist Dr. Lilian Cheung show us how to end our struggles with weight once and for all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering practical tools, including personalized goal setting, a detailed nutrition guide, and a mindful living plan, the authors help us to uncover the roots of our habits and then guide us as we transform our actions. &lt;em&gt;Savor&lt;/em&gt; teaches us how to easily adopt the practice of &lt;em&gt;mindfulness&lt;/em&gt; and integrate it into eating, exercise, and all facets of our daily life, so that being conscious and present becomes a core part of our being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the awareness of the present moment, the realization of why we do what we do, that enables us to stop feeling bad and start changing our behavior. &lt;em&gt;Savor&lt;/em&gt; not only helps us achieve the healthy weight and well-being we seek, but it also brings to the surface the rich abundance of life available to us in every moment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
