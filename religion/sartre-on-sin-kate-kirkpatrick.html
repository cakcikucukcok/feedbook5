  <title>Sartre on Sin - Kate Kirkpatrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sartre on Sin: Between Being and Nothingness argues that Jean-Paul Sartre&#39;s early, anti-humanist philosophy is indebted to the Christian doctrine of original sin. On the standard reading, Sartre&#39;s most fundamental and attractive idea is freedom: he wished to demonstrate the existence of human freedom, and did so by connecting consciousness with nothingness. Focusing on Being and Nothingness, Kate Kirkpatrick demonstrates that Sartre&#39;s concept of
nothingness (le néant) has a Christian genealogy which has been overlooked in philosophical and theological discussions of his work. Previous scholars have noted the resemblance between Sartre&#39;s and Augustine&#39;s ontologies: to name but one shared theme, both thinkers describe the human as the being through which
nothingness enters the world. However, there has been no previous in-depth examination of this &#39;resemblance&#39;. Using historical, exegetical, and conceptual methods, Kirkpatrick demonstrates that Sartre&#39;s intellectual formation prior to his discovery of phenomenology included theological elements-especially concerning the compatibility of freedom with sin and grace.
After outlining the French Augustinianisms by which Sartre&#39;s account of the human as &#39;between being and nothingness&#39; was informed, Kirkpatrick offers a close reading of Being and Nothingness which shows that the psychological, epistemological, and ethical consequences of Sartre&#39;s le néant closely resemble the consequences of its theological predecessor; and that his account of freedom can be read as an anti-theodicy. Sartre on Sin illustrates that Sartre&#39; s insights are
valuable resources for contemporary hamartiology." />
