  <title>Eternal Harmony - Dr. Ron R. Rickards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Has modern physics proven that the universe was created by absolutely nothing? Absolutely not! Have modern cosmology and Darwinian evolution eliminated the need for God? Absolutely not! Have the new atheists demonstrated the irrelevance of theology and philosophy in the pursuit of Truth? Not even close!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The first of the four-volume Eternal Harmony series, The Unity of Truth in God demonstrates decisively the powerful convergence of God-made religion and genuine science as well as faith and reason in the unity of truth in the one, true, triune God of the Holy Bible. The Tower of Modern Scientism is concurrently demolished so that not one scientistic stone is left standing upon another. 
Can the truths of modern science and God-made religion be brought into Eternal Harmony? Most definitely! Are human life and the cosmos meaningful and purposeful? Yes! Can you personally inherit eternal life in the new heavens and the new earth and be with God Himself? Absolutely! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join physicist Dr. Ron R. Rickards on a sacred journey up the Mountain of Truth, which begins on common scientific and religious ground and ends with the most exalted truths of modern science and God-made religion coexisting peacefully in Eternal Harmony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By incorporating the lyric sheets to a dozen original songs, The Unity of Truth in God engages the reader as all human beings truly deserve to be engaged: in the fullness of our humanitythat is, in heart, soul, and mind. The soundtrack is available through Amazon, iTunes and other popular outlets.&lt;/p&gt;" />
