  <title>Preaching Through the Pain - Helen M. Crawford McBynum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Reverend McBynum took her seat in the pulpit for the first time she realized she had also stepped into her Purpose. With that realization came such joy and peace within her that she had never felt before. She knew she was finally home where she belonged. This shy country girl from North Carolina was home.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;She had no idea that there was a pain that she would soon experience, and that it would be a pain that she had never felt before and only God would be able to take her through it, only he would be able to heal her spiritually and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;She would learn how to endure great joy and great pain at the same time , on two different levels, the human level as a mother and on the spiritual as a child of God and her faith and trust in Him would bring her through stronger than ever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
