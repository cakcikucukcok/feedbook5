  <title>When a Prodigal Breaks Your Heart - Nancy Ferrin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;By 1993, God had blessed Nancy Ferrin with six precious children. One was taken home to heaven soon after birth, but the others were her treasures here on earth. The early years were uneventful and filled with activities, family fun, and spiritual training. However, the teen years led one son on an unexpected, destructive path. Heartbreak grew when a few years later, her only daughter followed in her brothers footsteps. During those agonizing years, Gods peace sustained Nancy as she turned to Him repeatedly for understanding and strength. Because there are countless other parents dealing with similar struggles, this book is intended to help with the confusion and uncertainty of the prodigal years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
