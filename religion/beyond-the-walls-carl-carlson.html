  <title>Beyond the Walls - Carl Carlson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hope for the Hopeless&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Carlson started life with two strikes against him, and it didnt take long for him to strike out. Bounced from an orphanage to a small town in Florida to reform school to his first taste of jail, Carl was one of those kids we dont want around here, exactly what the towns respected football coach told him. By the time he was sixteen he found himself sitting in one of the toughest youth prisons in America, bitter and filled with hatred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl went on to lead Men of Valor, a ministry he founded to give men in prison hope and a chance to get out and stay out. Nationally, 70 percent of those in prison return after they are released. With MOV, that rate drops to less than 15 percent. In addition to providing a comprehensive mentoring and discipleship program for offenders, MOV serves the families and children of the menthe forgotten victims of crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Walls shares the miraculous story of how a dead-end kid was transformed by Gods love and led back to the place he most hated: prison. It highlights the dedicated work of hundreds of Nashville-area volunteers who are quietly rebuilding the lives of men and their families. But most of all, Beyond the Walls demonstrates what can happen in society when ordinary people live out their faith and carry the love of Jesus to the least of these.&lt;/p&gt;" />
