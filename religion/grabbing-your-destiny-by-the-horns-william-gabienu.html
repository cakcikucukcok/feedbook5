&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;William Gabienu hits all the right chords with his new book. You will find yourself hooked to this one within moments of opening it.~ Novel Ideas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From The Author&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Q) William, what is the overall message of your book Grabbing Your Destiny by the Horns?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) Dream big according to your God-given purpose. Do not stop at difficulties and grab your designed destiny. Have we started? Seriously? (laughs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q) Yes, I thought I would give you an easy one to begin with. Let me ask you, what is YOUR purpose and how did YOU find it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) The question of purpose varies from person to person and so is being able to fully understand it. Generally, our purpose is to glorify God by living out our lives fully, not in part. Personally, my purpose takes its root in God and I try to do my best with the abilities He has put within me to His praise and to the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q) Living a life in part? What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) By living a life in part, I simply mean the instance when people do not utilize wholly their God-given abilities maybe because of difficulties. Some people stop midway on their journey to their designed place in life. This is living life in part. Trust me Nick, this is not glorifying in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q) So youve been there? You have experienced living life in part?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) Sure! Thats why my desire to help all people realize that the power to accomplish within them is higher than any obstacle that tries to stop us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q) A reviewer said about your book that: [this book will show you] how to develop self-reliance and achieve your dreams. But what if you dont know what your dream is? Is living for God the dream all people should have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) Firstly, I appreciate those kind word describing my book and I thank whoever the person is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a point in that review I would like to correct, though. I emphasize self-realization, hard work, focus, and of course, dependence on God as my faith teaches me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q) So your book really only focuses on God and how God can glorify a life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) Living for God is not the only dream people should have. The phrase dream life runs throughout my book and what I mean is the desire of your heart, your ambitions and all that you aspire to be in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q) Your book relies heavily on the Bible for inspiration. Would you say that the Bible itself is a self-help guide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) No. No and no. Grabbing Your Destiny by the Horns is a book that seeks to help the reader realize that he is on earth for a purpose and that his talents, skills and abilities have been given to him so that life on earth can be more meaningful. All is attainable and possible if he marries correct action to the dreams of his heart. Nick, Im a bit uncomfortable calling it self-help. I would say the Bible and, for that matter, my book are inspirational and books that teach and enlighten. They teach self-realization, not self-help. It teaches ACTION on your part as well as mindfulness that all is of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
