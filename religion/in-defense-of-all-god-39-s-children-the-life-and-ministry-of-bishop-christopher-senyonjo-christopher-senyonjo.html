  <title>In Defense of All God&#39;s Children: The Life and Ministry of Bishop Christopher Senyonjo - Christopher Senyonjo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nothing in the background of Bishop Christopher Senyonjo would have predicted that, late in life, he would become an international spokesperson for the rights of LGBTQ people in his native Uganda and around the world.  Raised traditionally, he was a failed medical student turned teacher before the tragic death of his first wife, shortly after their marriage, set him on the path that led to ordination as priest and, later, as bishop.    It was only after his retirement as bishop and his establishment of a counseling practice that his current role began to emerge, as news of his empathy for clients who were members of the Ugandan LGBTQ community began to spread through word-of-mouth, and that same concern impelled him to speak out against Uganda&#39;s draconian policies toward LGBTQ people.  In the years since, he has risked his life for justice and inclusion and become a leading advocate for the place of gay and lesbian Christians in the life of the Anglican Communion, especially in Uganda. At 83, his memoirs tell a fascinating story." />
