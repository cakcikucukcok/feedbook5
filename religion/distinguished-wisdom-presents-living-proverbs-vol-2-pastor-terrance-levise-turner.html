  <title>Distinguished Wisdom Presents… “Living Proverbs”—Vol. 2 - Pastor Terrance Levise Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gods Word is the rock upon which a stable life is to be built. We are able to build a solid life stone by stone as we receive his enduring truths into our heart. Many attempt to build their lives upon less reliable materials such as their own feelings or empty philosophies. However, Gods Word has proven to be the central truth upon which all the reliable advice for living is derived. As society has become more and more volatile and as moral absolutes have been abandoned by various segments of society, it is good to know that Gods Word remains the same, and there are still those who believe and proclaim it boldly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In Distinguished Wisdom Presents . . . Living ProverbsVol. 2, author, pastor, and speaker Terrance Levise Turner proclaims the wisdom of Gods Word in over five hundred wisdom nuggets of truth. They are appropriately supported by scriptures, which further emphasize the meaning. The contemporary proverbs are expressed in a fresh, memorable manner that makes them enlightening and entertaining. The reader will gain a level of depth of meaning they may not have thought of before, and yet the nuggets are simply expressed so as to help anyone get it. Proverbs 4:7 says, Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting, get understanding. This second volume of Living Proverbs helps any reader to get wisdom and understanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any believer in the Lord Jesus Christ will appreciate this bold proclamation of the wisdom of God and the gospel. All who seek practical wisdom will benefit from this book. Whether you are a young person just starting off or a more experienced adult, you will be able to appreciate the words for living a successful life found in this book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
