  <title>The Eternal Business of Almighty God’S Glory Is Producing Disciples - Dr. Roger R. Hagwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is written for people of all ages, especially those who are busy trying to make a living, instead of living in the word of God.  God wants Christians to take care of His business, and He will take care of their business.  He wants to excite readers about His business.  Also, Gods glory is evident in this book in a tangible presence to anoint and to ignite a supernatural revival.  	
Now, it is time to see signs, wonders, and miracles in our churches.  I pray as one reads this book, a sense of oneness with Almighty God is developed and they become enveloped in His presence immediately.  Doing business in the Kingdom of God is where we belong as believers.
