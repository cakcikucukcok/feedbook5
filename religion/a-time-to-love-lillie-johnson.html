  <title>A Time to Love - Lillie Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Once in a lifetime, the most beautiful love story you will ever know is the one youre living. From love discovered as teens, to love rekindled as matured adults with grown children, this book takes you on the journey of two people who overcame extraordinary challenges, including a thirty-year separation, intense emotionally-protective barriers, and living over nine hundred miles apart, to ultimately claim an everlasting love. Now married over five years, read not only about the phenomenon of the love that brought them back together, but also of the faith, gratitude, and day to day practices that hold them together. Told in a two-person narrative filled with tender, heartwarming moments, humor, and practical wisdom, their story will make you smile, cry, and realize the beauty and power of love between two people and the mystery some call destiny. It will encourage you to revere Gods ability to make all things new in His own time. More than anything, it will inspire you to believe in miracles, particularly the miracle of love." />
