  <title>A Fighting Chance - Ricka Reeha Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To fight for your dreams, to fight for your marriages, to fight for your relationships, to fight for your healing that you just cannot afford to saythats just who I ambitterand thats who I have always been. Now it is time to start fighting because the only way you will get a chance in this world is only if you fight. The only way God can do anything with you is only if you fight, and his chance depends on your fight.
You are the answer to the very thing you are praying for, but because you have been wounded in the past, because you have been thrown into fights, youre not fighting the way youre used to. Youre not believing the way you use to. Youre allowing hurt to define you in a way that you dont even have to anymore because you got thrown into fights.
I believe that God wants to break that thing off you today, that he wants to show you that the fact you had to fight these lions and bears is not to keep you from growing. It is actually to show you that you can survive anything, that I had a hedge of protection over you all in the midst of it, and I know you did not come out without scars and wounds, but I am so good that I will use the scars and the wounds to work together for your good, so if you will get back into the fight I promise you that my word is true, that I am not a man that I should lie. I will heal and restore everything that you have lost in the fight.
The lions and bears you thought were gone in your past, I am going to actually use them to show you who you have always been. You have always been a fighter. Dont stop fighting now. You have always been victorious. Dont stop now. Dont let the pressures of where you are now make you forget that you were once comfortable under pressure." />
