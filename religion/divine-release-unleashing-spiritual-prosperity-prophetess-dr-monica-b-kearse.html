  <title>Divine Release: Unleashing Spiritual Prosperity - Prophetess Dr. Monica B. Kearse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Divine Release: Unleashing Spiritual Prosperity is a devotional used to guide everyone to their place and to their relationship with Christ. It is designed for people to emulate themselves and see where they are and where they should be in this world. Not only is it an engaging book to seek self-discovery, but it is designed for everyone to see where they are in life and where they are going to become a better person as a whole. Do individuals often look at the man in the mirror to see what kind of person he/she really is to others? Do individuals probe self-inventory to see if they are truly who they say they are? Do individuals lie to themselves and others to make it seem as if progress is being made when it really isnt going anywhere? Do individuals still feel stuck in the same place as they were several years ago? If you answer these questions in sincerity and one or more applies to you, then you need to read and study this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light; 1 Peter 2:9 (KJV)&lt;/p&gt;" />
