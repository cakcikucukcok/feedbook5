  <title>God&#39;s Best Is Me - Dr. Jeanne Sheffield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Jeanne Sheffields life has transitioned from a professional performer in show business in variety television in Los Angeles to her exciting, always challenging position as founder, author and teacher of Southern Grace Place USA located in NW Washington, DC. If you remember the days of variety television of the hit TV series Here Come The Brides, you saw her as David Souls girl friend or remembered her as one of the original Dean Martin Gold Diggers. She has fond memories of being a regular cast member of the Glen Campbell Good Time Hour and the Mack Davis Show and the Andy Williams Show. Today Dr. Jeanne wears many hats as inspirational singer, composer, voice, piano, character and etiquette teacher, and author. Her two new books, Gods Best Is Me, Living To Please God and Gods Best Is Your Child, her collaborating Home School Moms Teachers Guide can be purchased at www.authorhouse.com, www.amazon.com and Dr. Jeannes web site www.SouthernGracePlaceUSA.com. Dr. Jeannes interest in the development of Americas youth led to a creative position as columnist for the Collierville Independent Paper and the Southaven Press in both the Tennessee and Mississippi regions. She was affectionately known as Our Miss Manners in both publications. She has been featured as one of Americas outstanding etiquette teachers in Memphis Womans Magazine as well as Parent Magazine. Dr. Jeanne holds her Masters in Christian Counseling and her Doctorate in Theology from Jacksonville Theological Seminary in Jacksonville, FL. She originally created this work book as a self-enrichment program because of her concerns for inner city students who were greatly lacking in social skills, etiquette and character values. She felt compelled to develop a study that would address all of these vital issues and a dynamic course that would keep their attention. Over time she developed 25 topics including My Appearance, Eye to Eye Contact, Modesty Is In, Attitude = Gratitude, Communication Skills, Table Setting and Manners, Jealousy, Tactfulness, Formal Dining.... just to name a few..... Gods Best is Me offers several studies jam-packed with inner-active role playing of the worlds behavior and the right behavior, scripture memorization, character values, social skills, open discussions, games, plus several original praise songs written by Dr .Jeanne. Gods Best Is Me points our children and youth away from the many destructive influences of the world toward a life full of the character and etiquette of Christ. This exceptional 6 week study is a rich transformational foundation every parent will want their child to experience." />
