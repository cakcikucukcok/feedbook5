  <title>A Layman’S Commentary Volume 6 - John Devine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In todays world, it can be difficult to maintain your faith. Those seeking a greater understanding of the Bible have numerous excellent theological commentaries available to them, but due to volume and depth, many of these are out of reach of laypeople. Others lose contact with the Bible, because it no longer seems relevant to life. They use a superficial knowledge of science and evolution to exclude God and faith from their experiences. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Laymans Commentary: Volume 6Book of the Acts of the Apostles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; presents a passage-by-passage explanation of the Book of the Bible known as Acts. In this sixth volume, author John Devine covers the activities of the disciples from the final days of the ministry of Jesus on earth to the birth of the Church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the realization that salvation that comes by faith in Jesus Christ alone was not just for the Jewish people but for people of all nations, the message spread into Asia Minor and Europe, to Rome, centre of the then known world within the space of thirty years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the sermons of Peter, Stephen and Paul the basic doctrine of the early Church is revealed as in the major creeds presenting the Christian Worldview. Evidence for the Historicity of Jesus is given. &lt;/p&gt;" />
