  <title>End Times: Fact or Fiction - Robert E. Vick Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book begins with telling the reader of how and why the scriptures are true. I truly believe everyone should read this book because it tells the true story of the end of time as written in the Bible. It is a story for both believers and nonbelievers; it goes into great detail about Gods hatred for sin, such as those listed in the Ten Commandments: lying, stealing, blasphemy, etc., and his punishment for it. This is a story that will help you to understand Gods will for you to continue to be faithful to him, and for the nonbelievers, this book is written to help and persuade you to become a believer before it is too late. This book explains how to prepare for the last days; it explains to you all the things that God has in store for the entire world. Also, it explains what heaven and hell were created for; it tells you where heaven and hell are located. It explains each event that will take place and is set up in the order in which they will occur with the verses from the Bibles scriptures to back them up. The verses are taken from the Bible as they really are. I did not add or delete any words to make them more suitable. The next event to take place is the Rapture. This story goes into great detail about this event; it explains who Satan and the Antichrist really are. It also tells the readers why God must destroy the entire world and the universe with fire; it speaks of the stars melting and falling from the skies. It will help the readers to understand why there will be a new heaven and earth." />
