  <title>When Angels Fly - S Jackson, A Raymond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to be given this book as a gift, and&amp;nbsp;I am so grateful to my friend for giving me this to read...&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
it was truly inspiring. I can honestly say that no book that&amp;nbsp;I have read in recent times has had the emotional impact on&amp;nbsp;me that this book has had. I rode right alongside this mother&amp;nbsp;from the first diagnosis of her child&amp;#39;s illness, right through&amp;nbsp;to the conclusion. Even before her child&amp;#39;s illness, I had to&amp;nbsp;keep asking myself; are there really parents out there who treat&amp;nbsp;their children as horrifically as this woman&amp;#39;s mother and her&amp;nbsp;family had treated her? She went from an abused child, to a&amp;nbsp;loveless marriage filled with physical, mental and sexual&amp;nbsp;abuse, to losing her first child to a stillborn birth and&amp;nbsp;then finally reaping the rewards with two beautiful young boys.&amp;nbsp;Life was finally looking up for her before little Eli was struck&amp;nbsp;down with cancer. We follow his journey, step by step as the&amp;nbsp;young mother attempts to keep her sanity, split her time between&amp;nbsp;one child in the hospital and one two hundred and fifty miles&amp;nbsp;away. You can really feel her anguish and pain in every page.&amp;nbsp;All the while, the very people who should have been helping to&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
ease her burden; her mother, her siblings and her soon to be&amp;nbsp;ex-husband were so busy plotting and planning on how they could&amp;nbsp;benefit from this turn of events, she was left to struggle along&amp;nbsp;with support only from some special friends. This book is a&amp;nbsp;harrowing read, make no mistake, but it is also incredibly rewarding.&amp;nbsp;To anyone who has ever complained about how hard their life is -&amp;nbsp;I say; read &amp;quot;When Angels Fly&amp;quot;. To anyone who has ever said their l&lt;br /&gt;
ife sucked - I say; read &amp;quot;When Angels Fly&amp;quot;. When you have seen&amp;nbsp;the courage, the fortitude and the immense challenges that this&amp;nbsp;woman and her beautiful son faced you can&amp;#39;t help but be uplifted&amp;nbsp;and reminded just how much we all have to be grateful for.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This book reveals our indomitable human spirit in such a powerful&amp;nbsp;and uplifting way. The book is in a large part a daily journal of&amp;nbsp;Eli&amp;#39;s time in hospital but I totally understand the need the author&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
felt to document every day - every day with her son was so very&amp;nbsp;precious. This book had a powerful impact on me as a reader. I was&amp;nbsp;truly moved by and genuinely felt everything this poor woman had&amp;nbsp;to endure... mostly alone. There was no way I could not give&amp;nbsp;this book five stars. The memories of Sarah, Noah and Eli will&amp;nbsp;live in my memory well after I&amp;#39;ve consigned this book to&amp;nbsp;the &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; shelf. I feel privileged to have shared Sarah&amp;#39;s harrowing&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
journey. When Angels Fly does exactly what it sets out to do&amp;nbsp;I believe - it reminds us that &amp;quot;There but for the grace of God, go I&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;I recommend this book to all.... it will make you cry, but it will&amp;nbsp;also uplift you. Well done. ~ Grant Leishman, Author, The Second Coming&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
