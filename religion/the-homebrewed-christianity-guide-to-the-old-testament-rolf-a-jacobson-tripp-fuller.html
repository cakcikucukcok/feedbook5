  <title>The Homebrewed Christianity Guide to the Old Testament - Rolf A. Jacobson, Tripp Fuller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Old Testament bears witness to an in-your-face, holy God--a God who gets down and dirty with creation and history; a God who gets in people&#39;s face with love and law, with power and purpose. Yet Israel&#39;s in-your-face God is also &quot;holy&quot;--too other, too raw, too intense to be handled without oven mitts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rolf Jacobson wrestles with this in-your-face God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Old Testament starts at the beginning, where God digs in the dirt to create humanity and then gets in the dustlings&#39; faces when they sin. God smiles on Abraham and Sarah, electing their descendants as the chosen people, but has to get in Pharaoh&#39;s face when he tries to enslave the people. Mostly, God gets in Israel&#39;s face: with laws about what it looks like to be God&#39;s people and through the prophets, who have to get in the faces of those who turn away from the Holy One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacobson also explores the psalms, poetry in which God often hides his face. He closes by exploring how the Old Testament points us ahead to Jesus, when God took on a human face and offered us the most intimate picture of God we&#39;ll ever get.&lt;/p&gt;" />

The Homebrewed Christianity Guide to Church History: Flaming Heretics and Heavy Drinkers<br /><b><i>The Homebrewed Christianity Guide to Church History ...</i></b> | Christology is crazy. It's rather absurd to identify a first-century homeless Jew as God revealed, but a bunch of us do anyway.
