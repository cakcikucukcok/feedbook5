  <title>The Eye Single - John Lundell, C. Menyennett, C. Menyennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jesus gave a simple commandment: &amp;ldquo;What I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.&amp;rdquo; He asked, &amp;ldquo;Could you not watch with me one hour?&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;The Eye Single&lt;/em&gt; is about obeying His instruction and following His example. An eye single is an eye watching for and with Jesus, and the goal of watching is life in the Spirit.&amp;nbsp;In watchings, prophets saw visions, Paul received revelation, and Jesus communed with our Father.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Physically, watching is being alert, attentive and seeing with no thought and no desire, just awareness. Spiritually, it is much more. Watching is knowledge of God:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Be still and know that I am God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You come alive in the Spirit when you watch. You become as He is&amp;mdash;wholly aware, for &amp;ldquo;the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.&amp;rdquo; You see Jesus, you see God. For Jesus is God, and &amp;ldquo;God is light.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Watching is Jesus&amp;rsquo; way, which is the only way, to union with God. His way transcends all meditative and contemplative practices, all new-age techniques and psychological methods: &amp;ldquo;I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Watch to see Jesus. He is here&amp;mdash;now. He came back the moment He left. When He ascended into Spirit, He returned in the Spirit. His presence remains. Watch, and experience the &amp;ldquo;peace of God, which passeth all understanding.&amp;rdquo; Unbound, as &amp;ldquo;an heir of God through Christ,&amp;rdquo; you have everything to gain. Watch to &amp;ldquo;see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />

    	<p>Jesus gave a simple commandment: “What I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.” He asked, “Could you not watch with me one hour?” <em>The Eye Single</em> is about obeying His instruction and following His example. An eye single is an eye watching for and with Jesus, and the goal of watching is life in the Spirit. In watchings, prophets saw visions, Paul received revelation, and Jesus communed with our Father.  </p><p>Physically, watching is being alert, attentive and seeing with no thought and no desire, just awareness. Spiritually, it is much more. Watching is knowledge of God: </p><p>                                                                      “Be still and know that I am God.” </p><p>You come alive in the Spirit when you watch. You become as He is—wholly aware, for “the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.” You see Jesus, you see God. For Jesus is God, and “God is light.” “If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.” “Believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.”  </p><p>Watching is Jesus’ way, which is the only way, to union with God. His way transcends all meditative and contemplative practices, all new-age techniques and psychological methods: “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”  </p><p>Watch to see Jesus. He is here—now. He came back the moment He left. When He ascended into Spirit, He returned in the Spirit. His presence remains. Watch, and experience the “peace of God, which passeth all understanding.” Unbound, as “an heir of God through Christ,” you have everything to gain. Watch to “see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.”</p>
