      <meta name="description" content="“I want to die fully alive so my soul’s got extended capacity for heaven.”—Rob LaceyPeople Like Us is the story of Rob Lacey, poet, actor, and award-winning author of The Street Bible. It is so much more than Rob Lacey’s biography.A Long Way Home is the passionate and poetic account of an artistic soul enamored with God, and of the woman who loved him. It is a love story of two people, a writer and a dancer, born to be together for all eternity.A Long Way Home is the memoir Rob Lacey would have written himself.He never got the chance. In May 2006, Rob went to be with the God he adored. Foregoing medical treatment for cancer, he squeezed every last drop out of life that he possibly could, right up to the end. That’s just how Rob Lacey was.Now his wife and best friend, Sandra Harnisch-Lacey, shares Rob’s story, her story, their story. Vibrant with laughter and moistened with tears, A Long Way Home is a memoir of faith, hope, and love that endures forever." />
