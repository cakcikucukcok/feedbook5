  <title>God&#39;s Perfect Child - Caroline Fraser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Pulitzer Prize-winning author and former Christian Scientist Caroline Fraser comes the first unvarnished account of one of America&#39;s most controversial and little-understood religious movements.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans - from Lady Astor to Ginger Rogers to Watergate conspirator H. R. Haldeman - have been touched by the Church of Christ, Scientist. Founded by Mary Baker Eddy in 1879, Christian Science was based on a belief that intense contemplation of the perfection of God can heal all ills - an extreme expression of the American faith in self-reliance. In this unflinching investigation, Caroline Fraser, herself raised in a Scientist household, shows how the Church transformed itself from a small, eccentric sect into a politically powerful and socially respectable religion, and explores the human cost of Christian Science&#39;s remarkable rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fraser examines the strange life and psychology of Mary Baker Eddy, who lived in dread of a kind of witchcraft she called Malicious Animal Magnetism. She takes us into the closed world of Eddy&#39;s followers, who refuse to acknowledge the existence of illness and death and reject modern medicine, even at the cost of their children&#39;s lives. She reveals just how Christian Science managed to gain extraordinary legal and Congressional sanction for its dubious practices and tracks its enormous influence on new-age beliefs and other modern healing cults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A passionate exposé of zealotry, &lt;i&gt;God&#39;s Perfect Child&lt;/i&gt; tells one of the most dramatic and little-known stories in American religious history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
