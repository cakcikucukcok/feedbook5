  <title>A Bee in the Church House - G. Brown-Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Bee In The Church House (The Sting of sin)is a testimony of an overcoming victor; exposing instances of usual drama or traumatic experiences that can be a root of bitterness as a hindering wound, if not healed.
The power of the Holy Spirit produces a walk in the newness of Christ by faith, eradicating a
form of godliness. When tested or tried we persevere in prayer, diligently seeking God through transformation by renewing the mind; righteously equipped to do that written in our manual for living now, and the world to come.
Gods word is the Truth, revealing an evil spirit when holding the truth in unrighteousness. A modern day overview of the New Testament Book of Romans with
an awareness of a lingering spirit among us that is suspect; existing as a spirit of anger, selfishness,
deceit, bitterness, strife, buzzing, hissing, and at times appearing, as a rattling pit demon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;i&gt; will enlighten, liberate and empower the believer experiencing the searing pain of
a church hurt. Guidance is to be received through this labyrinth of emotional and
spiritual devastation as a powerful and insightful reflection of Gods Word.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-- Pastor Stephanie Stratford,&lt;br&gt;
Ekklesia Family Life and Worship Center, Brentwood, MD&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;helped to expose a systematic problem within the walls of our sanctuaries and has
provided for each reader a Godly exit strategy that one must work at to be the man or
woman of God that He is calling for in these last and evil days.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-- Eric D. Barksdale, Senior Pastor/Teacher, Washington, DC&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;i&gt; bares her soul in a very moving testimony that will stir your heart
and provide insights for spiritual growth and development.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-- Reverend Welton Fields, Jr., PhD&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Herein is revealed to the reader that there is a turf battle (Strong Holds)
in the church, i.e.,: This is my song; this is my seat; this is my....
When these turfs are threatened, the Bee will look to and use its sting,
seemingly in many cases, to the detriment of the Believer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
