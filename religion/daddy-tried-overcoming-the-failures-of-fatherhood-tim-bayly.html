  <title>Daddy Tried: Overcoming the Failures of Fatherhood - Tim Bayly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every father knows failure. It comes with the territory. One generation to the next, imperfect men chip away at God&amp;rsquo;s original design for daddies, leaving a flawed pattern for their sons to follow. Overwhelmed by their failures, it&amp;rsquo;s easy for fathers to feel they have blown it for good and can&amp;rsquo;t redeem themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within these pages, Tim Bayly offers a frank and hope-filled path to overcoming the inherent failures of imperfect fathers&amp;mdash;and to reclaiming manhood and dignity for the man called &lt;em&gt;Daddy&lt;/em&gt;. Drawing from decades of his own journey as an imperfect son, father, and pastor, Bayly makes it clear there are no quick fixes. The road to recovery is paved with blood, sweat, and tears, but our Savior walked this path before us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daddy Tried&lt;/em&gt; makes no apologies for being a book for men. Its subject is the male-only club of fatherhood. It takes the only perfect Father as our guide. Bayly stares the sins of fathers past, present, and future squarely in the face and clears a path to overcoming them&amp;mdash;a path that begins with faith in our heavenly Father who tells us He knows our weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;" />
