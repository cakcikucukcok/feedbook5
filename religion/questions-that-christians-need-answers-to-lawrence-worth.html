  <title>Questions That Christians Need Answers To - Lawrence Worth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I am a physical Jew who accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal
savior at the age of 40. I am now 68. You would consider me a Messianic
Jew, whom God lifted off the veil spoken of in Isiah 6:10; 29:10, and in
Romans 11:7-10, 25, and in John 12:40. I wondered in the wilderness
for 40 years in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also a retired physician of Internal Medicine, and thus interested
in the relationship between the spirit, soul, and brain. Also, as a Jew who
can now see the light, I can see why God allowed the Holocaust to occur,
as dreadful as it was. But I also see in the near future, the end of this age,
a more severe calamity befalling my people the Jews, called Th e Time of
Jacobs Trouble (Jer 30:7) or the Great Tribulation (Dan 12:1), under
an even worse leader, the AntiChrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also greatly concerned about the Doctrines of the Pretribulation
Rapture and Imminency, and desire to show you why these Doctrines
are in error. My main source of Bible study is the Bible itself, and the help
of the Greek meaning of certain words.&lt;/p&gt;" />
