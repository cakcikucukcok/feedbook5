  <title>History of the Recent Coptic Orthodox Popes - Nader Rizk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is to all the Coptic people wherever they are, in Egypt or anywhere else on this earth. I do not intend to insult anyone but to tell the Coptic that they do not know about their own church and its history and the mistakes that were done in the twentieth century and the twenty-first century. 
This book will be a reference to any person who likes to know the truth and historical record of the facts. This is also a record of incidents that happened in 1955 and 1963. These two incidents have been forgotten, and nobody has mentioned them or thought of them anymore. Everyone should know these incidents and know that the hand of God made these incidents without interference of any mans hand.
It is a shame that there no one has pointed out these mistakes from the people or the clergy or the thinker. In the year 1974, I asked Anba Bakhomious the question that will be the topic of this book. His holiness Bakhomious could not answer me and smile. But I got a big punch in my stomach from a priest that was sitting on my right. Now I am writing this book before the bishop and before I leave this world because I am seventy-six years old, and I dont have many days left on this earth.
The reason for this is one statement from the Bible: For the zeal of thine house has eaten me up . . . (Ps. 69:9)." />
