  <title>JUSTIFIED: A Detective Vic Gonnella Thriller - Louis Romano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five years ago, the world found themselves conflicted as they cheered for a serial killer. John Deegan, ex-special ops, and a master of disguise with his appearance and voice, was the most hunted man on the planet for murdering pedophiles by stabbing them in their necks with sharpened-to-a-point crucifixes, and that included the priest who molested him when he was a little boy. Unfortunately, the Catholic Church still never made any changes to protect children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;It is now 2016, and Pope Francis, leader of the world&amp;rsquo;s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics is retiring due to ill health, and all the world&amp;rsquo;s cardinals will be descending upon the Sistine Chapel for the conclave to elect a new pope. When a string of gruesome murders take place in and around the catacombs, historic churches, and homosexual hot spots of Rome, some fear the worst is yet to come and the prophesy of St. Malachy may be taking place ~ that Pope Francis, the 212th pope, will be the Church&amp;rsquo;s last pope, as clearly, a madman is on the loose. Fearing a disaster, and trying to avoid yet another media frenzy, the Vatican secretly calls on Detective Vic Gonnella to track Deegan down before any leaks take place and their reputation tainted. Vic uncovers, however, that Deegan is also in ill health. Is John Deegan planning one final gift to the world? Does he go incognito as a cardinal? A Swiss Guardsman? And more importantly has he recruited and trained more people to continue his plan for JUSTICE after he dies?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
