  <title>Marriage 101 - Shawn Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The most important subject that the Bible speaks about is Christ and the Church.  The Bible teaches that God loved us so much that He sent His only begotten Son to be crucified for us, that we might be reconciled unto Him.  It teaches that Christ loved us so much that He was willing to die on the cross and pay the expensive dowry, that we could be His bride.  Therefore, if Christ and the Church is not only the main theme of the Bible but the most important truth in the Bible, then where does this place marriage?  God patterned marriage after Christ and the Church.  Therefore, Christs relationship to His Church shows us how important marriage is in the eyes of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marriage is patterned after Christs relationship to His Church; consequently, the more we understand about that relationship, the more we will know about Gods standards for marriage, and the more able we will be to have a marriage based upon Gods prescribed order for it.  God ordained marriage, therefore, it would seem very probable that He should be the One that knows the most about it.  He teaches us about it in the Bible, so if we are going to have a godly marriage that is full of every blessing God ordained for it, it would only make sense to follow His instructions. This book is for anyone planning marriage, as well as those who have been married for years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
