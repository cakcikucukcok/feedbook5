  <title>The Moment of Truth &amp; the Arrival of the Stupor of Death - Sam Christian</title>

&amp;
The Arrival of the Stupor of Death 
If only Id taken the path of the messenger!
Lest We Say, If only Id been Muslim enough!
This book is not a philosophical, political, biographical, or historical account of anybody nor is it an account of the United States elections, which catapulted a pharaoh-qarun like Donald Trump to become the president of the United States of America, but it is a plea to the genus of man, believers, and atheists, Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim, including the fascist new president of the USA to return to the Lord of Moses, who spoke to Moses from beyond the seventh sky, Verily! I am Allah! La ilaha illa Ana (none has the right to be worshipped but I), so worship me, and perform as-salat (prayers) for my remembrance. O Musa (Moses)! Verily! I am Allah, the Lord of Al-Alamin (mankind, jinn, and all that exists)! Verily, the hour is coming, and my will is to keep it hidden so that every person may be rewarded for that which he strives.  There is no doubt, this is a perfect creed which served its time but was complemented and superseded first by Christianity and then both were later superseded by the last and universal faith, Islam, the message Mohammad preached to humanity. No wonder the name of the Lord (Allah), which he taught Moses and to all, is the simplest that can be said easily by an infant starting to speak. Any other name does not apply to nor fit him of glory!" />
