  <title>A Religious Curse—Judeo-Christian History - Boyd Gutbrod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born into an anti-Jewish family and growing up in a strong Christian environment, author Boyd Gutbrod became a staunch anti-Semitic, a stance that lasted well into his adulthood. Through the ardent study of history while trying to find proof that Catholicism was the one true Christian faith, he discovered the reasons and circumstances that fostered the hatred of Jews. In A Religious CurseJudeo-Christian History, he shares the results of his years of study in the hopes an understanding of history will improve future inter-faith relationships.
Gutbrod offers a history of the Jewish-Christian relationship, answering such questions as: Were Judas Iscariot and Barabbas real historical people? Who really killed Goliath? Was Jesus a rebel? What caused the split between Judaism and Christianity? Told through the use of many sources and speculations based on solid evidence, the story starts with pre-Judaism and moves on to Judaism giving birth to Christianity, a mother-daughter story, and the tragic events that nearly led up to a matricidal event. 
A Religious CurseJudeo-Christian History focuses on Bible stories and presents a new approach to understanding its factual history." />
