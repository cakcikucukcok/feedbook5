  <title>How God Got Mary Pregnant - Jeremiah C. Southerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How God got Mary pregnant is a look into the mechanics of how God went about doing a work that was good for humanity when humanity did not even know they needed what He was offering. And how He got Himself into a world that He was basically locked out of by carnal hostile thinking. Your spiritual salvation today is the end result of a long process that took 4000 years to establish and it happen 2000 years ago. God did not have the right to just do what He wanted to do for He had given the earth to mankind. So it was men, dead men and women He had to work through to get what dead mankind needed into the earth. All the while the dead men were being swayed as much as possible to think they were not dead and did not need what God was offering by our enemy Satan. I am talking of course of things that are spiritual, things we cant see until we look deep enough into the Bible to see past our doctrinal squabbles. How God got Mary pregnant transcends denominations in that as Christians we believe in Jesus and His finished work, this explains from behind the scenes what transpired to make that work happen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
