  <title>There Were Giants on the Earth in Those Days… and Also After That - Roberta Sams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What I appreciate about There Were Giants on the Earth in Those Days  and Also After That, is that it is not only intelligible but is enjoyable to read. It doesnt require the reader to know a lot about eschatology but provides them a learning experience, as the author has done extensive research and study to uncover the mysteries of the Bible, which has all the answers. It tells what is going to happen in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book deals with how Lucifer was cast out of heaven when he rebelled against God and how sin first entered into the world in the garden of Eden. It shows how Satan has battled against God and His plan to provide salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects like giants in the land, the flood, false religions, Islam, secret societies, UFOs, and others are discussed. The Federal Reserve, and HAARP, by which they are trying to control the weather, the Rapture, the new world order, the mark of the beast, and the Antichrist are all dealt with according to the Word of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend the entire book be read in order to experience the benefits of the authors laborious efforts to cover the past, the present, and the future of our world. &lt;/p&gt;
