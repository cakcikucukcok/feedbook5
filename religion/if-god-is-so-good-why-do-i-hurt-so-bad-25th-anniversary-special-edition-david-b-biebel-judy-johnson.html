  <title>If God is So Good, Why Do I Hurt So Bad?: 25th Anniversary Special Edition - David B Biebel, Judy Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this powerful book, Biebel leaves behind the all-too-familiar platitudes and instead offers the unvarnished truth about the pain of illness, death, divorce, financial ruin, and more. With keen insight and a Christian outlook, Biebel puts God right by your side to help you sort through your hurt and see the value in your trials. His real-life examples and honest approach will help you turn pain into a meaningful journey toward hope and happiness.  &quot;This book saved my life,&quot; one bereaved father said. A young woman wrote, &quot;I kept this book on my nightstand. Late at night, when I was alone and afraid, I could feel its presence hanging over me like a lightly floating sheet making me feel safe.&quot;  Over the past twenty-five years, this book has brought comfort and hope to hundreds of thousands of the author&#39;s fellow pilgrims on the way of suffering. Now, this major revision is even more practical and helpful for those who hurt and those who wish to understand.  In these pages you will find: - Eight essential truths about pain and healing - Questions for personal reflection or group study - Insights into relevant biblical texts and themes - A pathway toward a deeper, more personal relationship with the One who shares our  sorrows, and is acquainted with our grief  One of the most profound, empathetic and beautiful books ever written on the subject of suffering and loss.  - Sheila Walsh  In this remarkable book, my friend Dave Biebel helps the reader understand exactly what&#39;s so good about God in the midst of suffering. - Joni Eareckson Tada" />
