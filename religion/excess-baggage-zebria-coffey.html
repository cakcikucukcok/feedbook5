  <title>Excess Baggage - Zebria Coffey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When packing for a trip, carrying excess baggage can make your trip more difficult than it should be. Excess baggage in our lives can have the same effects; it can weigh us down and place insurmountable pressure on our lives
This guide explores the kind of excess baggage that a Christian may be carrying through life. Author Zebria Coffey has defined it as, among other things, behavior that does not befit a Christian, such as wrath, malice, jealousy, anger, filthy language, evil desires, and a lying tongue. She also includes the challenge of taking on too many activities without considering the time and energy it will take to complete them. We have all been guilty at one time or another of saying yes to too many projects or activities, only to feel burnt out at the end.  
Excess baggage is burdensome to us. It is necessary to begin to identify and acknowledge it in our lives and then make a conscious decision to lighten our loads. The message in Excess Baggage reminds us of what our most important priority in life should beputting God before all others. When we put God first, He directs our path in life and helps us to determine how best to handle tasks and priorities as they are presented to us." />
