  <title>Move from Failure to Success! - Tyler Judge Nadelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discover the power to overcome failures, adversities,&lt;br /&gt;
and adversaries, and turn setbacks to great comebacks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a seeming dead-end situation? Have you been looked down upon as a failure? Have you been called barren and fruitless? Have you been bypassed in a promotion or perhaps just felt betrayed? Maybe youre a student facing many challenges in your course of study. Life is full of crises, hassles, and struggles. You need to know how to equip yourself to overcome and turn failure into success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move from Failure to Success can teach you how to take your cross, rise up, and walk. You do not need to feel inferior, squirm angrily, complain, or hide anymore. Learn the secrets embedded in the prayer of Hannah to knock on the heavenly door and possess your possessions. You can move the hand of God as well and enjoy His unquestionable favor and grace as Hannah did. She experienced abundance after years of lack, downcast, and reproach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often fail to recognize that our Father is in our storms and persecutions. He only expects us to take certain positive, natural steps. Master the spiritual keys of prophetic prayer, faith, and patience, and combine them with personal keys of knowledge and diligence to unlock the windows of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you enjoyed reading The Prayer of Jabez, you will definitely enjoy Move from Failure to Success, based on the insightful Prayer of Hannah.&lt;/p&gt;" />
