  <title>Interrupted  to  Be - Dr. Annie B. Wilder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is not a how to bookit is a God can book.
Those are the words Dr. Wilder heard in her spirit regarding the intended purpose for this book. She has endeavored to stay true to the assignment.
 Are you one of the many individuals that have had vivid spiritual dreams, been transported in visions to a place(s) yet to be visited, received glowing prophecies, been anointed with oil to perform mighty worksin ministry, business or otherwiseyet the time has grown long and the position you currently find yourself has no resemblance of any of those things? 
Interrupted to Be  demonstrates that interrupted plans in life are not always meant for our demise. Often  they are to make our calling and election sure.
Dr. Wilder takes us on a twenty year journey through the early life of a lad by the name of David. He was the youngest of eight boys born to a sheepherder. Yet, at an early age he was chosen by God to mount the throne of a Kingdom that already had a reigning king.  His story depicts that the unforeseen twists, turns and mysteries that occur in life have purpose.  His journey offers evidence to the fact that God watches over His word to perform itIf He said it  it will come to pass." />
