  <title>Think Before You Leap - Misty Dawn Metcalf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;_Hlk507260116&quot;&gt;Have you seriously considered the cost of getting married? Do you have what it takes to not only start but finish? Remember there is no expiration date on marriage. No one stands before an officiant and declares their unfailing love with a definitive completion date. In haste, I thought this question was easy to answer. I answered it with a resounding yes, as my then fianc&amp;eacute; purposed to me on a brisk December morning, thousands of feet in the sky. In retrospect, I was totally naive to the cost of marriage. I would like to say that premarital classes completely sobered my judgment, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t. How could it? I was fighting God. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which begs the question, &amp;ldquo;How was this going to be a godly marriage?&amp;rdquo; It wasn&amp;rsquo;t. This book will explore how I was fighting God in eight areas of my life that I have coined &lt;strong&gt;LEAP BLOCKERS&lt;/strong&gt;. These were the things that kept me from submitting to God and being prepared for a godly marriage. I wonder if you can identify with my leap blockers? If you are seriously considering marriage, I encourage you to take a look. This is a condemnation free zone, as this book is laced with truth and transparency. So, be honest with yourself, and ask God to give you wisdom. Your honesty will lead to your freedom. &amp;nbsp;I pray this book is as much of a blessing to you as it is for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think Before You Leap&lt;/em&gt; is designed to be an interactive study, in both personal and group settings. Concluding each chapter, are a series of questions that can be answered during your reflection time. At the rear of the book, are group study questions for each chapter. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;" />
