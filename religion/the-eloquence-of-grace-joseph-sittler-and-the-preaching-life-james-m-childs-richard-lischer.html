  <title>The Eloquence of Grace: Joseph Sittler and the Preaching Life - James M. Childs, Richard Lischer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joseph A. Sittler (1904-1987) was one of the most influential theologians of the twentieth century, distinguished for his pioneering work in ecology and for his preeminence as a preacher. He gave both the Beecher Lectures at Yale and the Noble Lectures at Harvard. As the preacher&#39;s theologian, Sittler approached the interpretation of Scripture with a clear understanding of current critical scholarship, but also in the freedom of the gospel at the center of Scripture and with the humility of a theologian of the cross. In following the trajectory of the text into the preaching situation he gave a lively, timeless, and eloquent expression to the fact that the interpretation of texts is in the service of proclamation.  This collection of readings from Sittler&#39;s rich legacy contains a great many presentations and sermons that have never before appeared in print. Theologically serious preaching, close attention to language, engagement with the best of sacred and secular culture, and a deep respect for the text, all characteristics of Sittler&#39;s work, are the sort of features that continue to edify. They remain as benchmarks for good preaching even as styles and contexts evolve." />
