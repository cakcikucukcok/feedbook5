  <title>Focused Praying - Lemuel Baker Phd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written during a period of my life when my spiritual life shifted to an understanding of the authority of every believer as it pertains to prayer. I realized that the Holy Spirit can help each of us break out of passivity and shift into fervent focused prayer exercising full authority over the enemy in prayer. The information in this book helps to accommodate that shift. 
The principle of speaking to the mountain is not an optional exercise but critical to our fulfilling a long satisfying life. I pray you receive the divine shift in your spirit as you read this 141 page book.
There comes a time in every Christians life when the thought comes to mind even more than once this situation has gone too far and is out of control. During these times we begin to yearn for answers to our circumstances that are magnanimous. Initially we may blame men for the circumstances but intuitively and scripturally we begin to suspect there is an evil force called the enemy who controls and influences people and situations. 
Many times we end up in such a pickle it takes a miracle to get us out of the situation. The Holy Spirit is always ready to raise a standard against satan through us and this requires a genuine spiritual shift in our spirit man from a passive mode to a commanding mode mixed with strong faith.
This book grants awareness of this spiritual shift and shows how critical it is and how logical and how natural it is to make this spiritual shift as part of functioning in Gods Kingdom to achieve longevity.
Some of the topics covered are the role of angels that minister for us, only mature Christians can fight successfully, dealing with the enemies within us before we can address the enemy outside us and so on.
God wants to see us experience the victory through Jesus Christ along with character to have faith in God during severe hopeless trials." />
