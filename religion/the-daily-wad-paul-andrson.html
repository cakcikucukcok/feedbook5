  <title>The Daily Wad - Paul Andrson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Some years ago, I noticed that certain verses and even brief phrases seemed to stand out from Bible passages I read during my daily devotions. I found myself thinking about, meditating on, ruminating the words throughout the day. It amused me to picture myself chewing my cud. I shouldnt have been surprised. The Bible does say we are his people, the sheep of his pasture (Psalm 100:3 b, NIV), and sheep chew a cud.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Other pictures came to mind: a baseball player as he chewed a wad of bubble gum; an old codger with a chaw of tobacco tucked into one cheek. The more delicate expression would be in reference to Mary, the mother of Jesus. Of her the Scriptures record: But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart (Luke 2:19, NIV). The meaning is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You thrill to Gods Word, you chew on Scripture day and night (Psalm 1:23, The Message).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So was born my daily wad. I wrote the phrases on cards, thought about the words throughout the day, and shared them with others as opportunity presented itself. I was blessed, others were blessed. My prayer is that you will be blessed as you read, ruminate, and are refreshed by &lt;em&gt;The Daily Wad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
