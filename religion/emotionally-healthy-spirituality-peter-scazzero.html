  <title>Emotionally Healthy Spirituality - Peter Scazzero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this revised bestselling book, Peter Scazzero outlines a roadmap for discipleship with Jesus that is powerfully transformative. He unveils what&#39;s wrong with our current definition of &quot;spiritual growth&quot; and offers not only a model of spirituality that actually works, but seven steps to change that will help you experience authentic faith and hunger for God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Scazzero learned the hard way: you can&#39;t be spiritually mature while remaining emotionally immature. Even though he was the pastor of a growing church, he did what most people do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid conflict in the name of Christianity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ignore his anger, sadness, and fear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use God to run from God&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Live without boundaries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually God awakened him to a biblical integration of emotional health and the spiritual practice of slowing down and quieting your life for to experience a firsthand relationship with Jesus. It created nothing short of a spiritual revolution in Scazzero, in his church, and now in thousands of other churches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this updated edition, Scazzero shares new stories and principles as he outlines his journey and the signs of emotionally unhealthy spirituality. Then he provides seven biblical, reality-tested ways to break through to the revolutionary life Christ meant for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out the full line of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Emotionally Healthy Spirituality&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;books dedicated to many different key areas of life.
