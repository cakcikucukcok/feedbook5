  <title>A Letter to the Middle East - Mike Gagnon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something very wrong with this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a war going on in the Middle East and, somehow, we are all involved without really wanting to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality is that the common and the average North American&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t hate the people of the Middle East. This belief has been constructed by the untruthful media because the corrupted politicians of both parties need us to hate and fear each other. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because people who live their lives in fear and anger are easier to manipulate. The business, religious and political leaders want us to feel oppressed and ready to blame each other for anything bad that happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things don&amp;rsquo;t have to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his open letter to the citizens of the Middle East, presented white paper style, Mike Gagnon encourages us all to open our eyes and understand that the situation that we&amp;rsquo;re in can change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to understand each other and realize that the only&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People that wish our fall are our corrupted leaders. Together, with love and understanding, we can bring peace and freedom to our world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t you want that, too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This whitepaper is being offered worldwide at the lowest cost possible in order to spread a message of peace and unity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brave act of subversion by the author in a corrupt society.&lt;/p&gt;" />
