  <title>The Divine Journey - Nikki Friedlander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Through the persona of Tori Litchfield, author Nikki Friedlander uses fiction to tell a deeply personal story of the alchemy of spirit. Both Tori and Nikki are women who came of age in the 1950s. Both are fueled with an unconventional drive to understand the deeper meanings of life; the challenges of balancing career, home life, children, and personal imperatives were no easier back then than they are today.
Tori is a successful fashion designer in New York City. We meet her as she is ready to go to Malta for a career-critical photo shoot with fashion photographer Luca. The seeds of change are sowed on this trip, as Tori first meets the mysterious Gabriella, and Luca faces a life-changing decision.  And for Tori, a visit to the Hypogeum, a pre-historic underground temple and sacred resting place of the Sleeping Goddess, opens a new door that lead her to many teachers and teachings, including Baba Muktananda, Drunvalo Melchizedek, Gurumayi, St. Germaine and Archangel Michael.
Throughout the book, Nikki alternates between story and reflection, as she speaks with humility and piercing honesty in the Interludes about marriage, partnership, the friendship of women, and the unexpected joys, gifts, and miracles of The Divine Journey." />
