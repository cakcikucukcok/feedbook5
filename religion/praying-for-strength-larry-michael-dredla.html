  <title>Praying for Strength - Larry Michael Dredla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Praying for Strength is a memoir of a drug addict turned teacher in Omaha, Nebraska.  Unlike most educators, Larry Dredla can relate to those struggling with drug and alcohol addiction through his own firsthand experiences.  Having been arrested multiple times, overcoming addiction, and coming face to face with his own mortality,  Praying for Strength, was the driving force that gave Larry the will to carry on.  
This book envelopes the struggles of a boy coming into his own.  How does a Catholic who believes in God become a drug addict?  What are the mechanisms that mold and shape us as individuals, and as a society? What are the signs we, as individuals, should be watching for when questioning our possible dependency on drugs or alcohol?  What extremes should parents go to for the sake of their son or daughter?
Praying for Strength is also a spiritual journey.  Throughout his past experiences, it was faith that helped Larry to survive.  Knowing times like these are difficult, Praying for Strength gives the reader a chance to get in touch with their spirit again and find peace of mind.  
This book is largely directed to the youth of America today.  Students dont want &quot;the run around&quot;, they want the truth.  Praying for Strength gives them that.  These accounts are for the student who may be struggling with anything from drug and alcohol addiction to suicidal tendencies; from recognizing their own moral compass, to finding their place in their family or society.  
A note to the reader: Know that the sky is the limit for you, no matter what.  But remember, when you Pray for Strength, God will make you strong, not always in the way that you want Him to, but through unbelievable challenges of the mind, body and spirit." />
