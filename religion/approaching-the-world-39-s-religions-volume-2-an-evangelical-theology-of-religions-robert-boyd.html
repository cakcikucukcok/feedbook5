  <title>Approaching the World&#39;s Religions, Volume 2: An Evangelical Theology of Religions - Robert Boyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Evangelical theology strives to be evangelical, conservative, and contemporary. In a world in which everyone is &quot;Christian,&quot; evangelical theology provides a balanced position between fundamentalism and liberalism. While theological debates within the family will occur, to be evangelical is a breath of fresh air for many.   However, we do not live in such a world. We do find ourselves living in a secular, global society. It is secular because no religious organization dictates how we live our lives. It is global for at least two reasons. First, our technology brings us immediately in contact with those faraway places. Second, and of more importance, we can simply step outside our front doors and encounter our neighborhoods that reflect a global pluralism.   This raises the question, how shall we then live? The intent of An Evangelical Theology of Religions is to suggest a direction for evangelicals to think about the secular, global society in which they live in a way that is not only conservative but also evangelical and contemporary. The final essay strives to address the evangelical aspect of our tradition that places an emphasis on the Great Commission and the law of love." />
