  <title>Concise Fundamentalism: An Introduction to Historic Christian Beliefs - Adam Murrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the early decades of the twentieth century, a series of books took an undaunted stance against increasing liberal influences over the essential meaning of key doctrines of the Christian faith. The publication of The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth brought both insight into current issues and clarity for pastors, theologians, missionaries, and other Christian workers. A new term was also introduced into the religious vernacular--fundamentalism. Originally meant an adherence to the fundamental tenets of biblical Christianity, the term has since lost its primary meaning and is now applied pejoratively toward someone who is against progress or intellectual views.  In this easy-to-read book, Adam Murrell takes us through the essays that comprised The Fundamentals, summarizing many of the difficult concepts precisely, with clear and simple language and reminds us what it truly means, in the historical sense, to be a fundamentalist. Each of the chapters is just enough to manage at one time, sufficient to nourish the mind as well as encourage the heart and inspire further study. There is also a list of recommended articles at the conclusion of each chapter for additional reading. The resulting work will long serve the church as an invaluable aid for digesting the fundamental doctrines of Christianity and teaching the eternal truths of Scripture in bite-sized segments. This work explains basic Bible beliefs regarding Holy Scripture, God and the Trinity, the deity of Christ, the resurrection, the fall into sin, the importance of missions, the true church, and much more. Every chapter is geared toward bringing us to a deeper knowledge and fuller understanding of the truths set forth in God&#39;s Word and defended so vigorously in the classic testimony to truth, The Fundamentals." />
