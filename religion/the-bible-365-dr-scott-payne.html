  <title>The Bible 365 - Dr. Scott Payne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy opening a box of chocolate candies and being surprised by the flavor, the texture, the filling, or the richness of the treat, you will be overcome with joy and excitement by the surprises you will find in the Bible as you read it in chronological order with the daily devotional thoughts from The Bible 365 that go along with scriptural passages for each day &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The daily devotionals that go along with the chronological reading of the Bible make each days reading clearer or add insight to some very difficult verses or chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane Trest, church member &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through the Bible in chronological order along with the daily perspectives in The Bible 365 reinforced the relevancy of the Scriptures to my daily walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randy King, elder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible 365 reading plan and devotionals helped me to draw nearer to God and gave me more direction for the purpose of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donna Wolfe, church member
It [The Bible 365] made me see and understand more of the history of the Bible and mans walk with, and too often without, God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sally Cook, director of the womens ministry&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;Using The Bible 365 along with the chronological Bible reading plan helped me to grasp the key points to grab the essentials from each days passage of Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Eaton, church member &lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Deciding to participate in the chronological reading plan, my desire was to more clearly understand the history, the present, and the future of Gods creation and to see God throughout the Bible working to redeem His creation for eternity. The Bible 365 companion to the Bible caused me to know God more, to love Him more, and to be sure of His amazing love for me for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
