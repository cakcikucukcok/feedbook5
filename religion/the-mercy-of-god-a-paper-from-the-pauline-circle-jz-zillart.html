  <title>The Mercy of God - A Paper from the Pauline Circle - JZ Zillart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Pauline Circle was started by Frank Duff, the founder of the Legion of Mary, in 1941. It was born as the Mercier Society at its conception and continues its ecumenical meetings today.  It welcomes theologians and lay alike to share a space together in open dialogue over the common areas of the Christian Faith.  Each month a new speaker is invited from within the circle or is a visiting guest from around the World.  JZ Zillart was invited to present her views as a Roman Catholic on the Mercy of God and so the following text is a published example of a paper that would otherwise not have been publicly available without attending the event itself.  This is a diverse paper covering many common themes of God&#39;s mercy given from the perspective of a lay person who is deeply in love with God.  70% of the proceeds are given to Myra House, where the Legion of Mary held its first meeting in 1941 and expanded into the glorious apostolic presence that it is today with millions of members worldwide." />
