  <title>The House of Sciences - Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Following a string of military defeats at the end of the eighteenth century, Ottoman leaders realized that their classical traditions and institutions could not compete with Russia and the European states&#39; technological and economic superiority.One of a series of nineteenth-century reform initiatives was the creation of a European-style university called &lt;em&gt;dar&amp;#252;lf&amp;#252;nun&lt;/em&gt;. From the Arabic words &lt;em&gt;dar&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &quot;house,&quot; and &lt;em&gt;f&amp;#252;nun&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &quot;sciences,&quot; the &lt;em&gt;dar&amp;#252;lf&amp;#252;nun&lt;/em&gt; would incorporate the western sciences into deeply entrenched academic traditions and institutions in an effort to bridge the gap with Europe. The completely new institution, distinct from the existing pre-modern &lt;em&gt;medreses&lt;/em&gt;, was modeled after the French educational system and created an infrastructure for national universities in Turkey and some of the Arab-speaking provinces. It also influenced the establishment of universities in Iran and Afghanistan.
Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu&#39;s study sheds new light on an important and pioneering experiment in East-West relations, tracking the multifaceted transformation at work in Istanbul during the transition from classical to modern modes of scientific education. Out of this intellectual ferment, a new Ottoman Turkish scientific language developed, the terminology of which served as a convenient vehicle for expressing and teaching modern science throughout the Empire." />
