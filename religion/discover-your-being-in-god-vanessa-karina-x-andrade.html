However; exist people in whose internal being is burning the will and the call of God for their lives; people to which God mades a call Because God is the one that in yourselves produce the want or the will as the doing; for his good will.

And you said: In what we had dishonored you? In thinking that the table of Jehovah is despreciable. The time of assuming the service and the call from God is today; God is talking to you and is calling you the time is now. (Rom 13:11)." />
