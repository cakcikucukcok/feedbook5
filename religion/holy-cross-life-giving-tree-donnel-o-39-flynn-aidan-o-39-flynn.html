  <title>Holy Cross, Life-Giving Tree - Donnel O&#39;Flynn, Aidan O&#39;Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• Historical perspective of the image of the cross as one of life instead of death • Resource for Lent, gaining a new understanding of Holy Cross Day and/or Hildegaard of Bingen  What would Christianity be like if the principle of a new creation were its guiding idea, and the Cross as Life-Giving Tree its central image? After exploring this principle&#39;s deep roots in tradition, worship, and art, this book proposes Hildegard of Bingen&#39;s concept of virditas-&quot;green-ness&quot;-as a way to know it in daily life. It claims the Cross as healer of division, both among followers of Jesus and among the nations. Holy Cross, Life-Giving Tree is illustrated with Cross images from throughout the Christian world and compares eastern Christian liturgies of the Cross with those of the west. It recounts the origins of the early Jerusalem cult of the Cross, and invites readers to meditate on Scripture passages used by ancient artists. Each of its six chapters ends with reflection questions for going deeper. Holy Cross, Life-Giving Tree is designed for use by study groups or by individuals." />
