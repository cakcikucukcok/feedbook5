  <title>Intermittent Streams - Charles Robert Costello Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Intermittent Streams is a reflection of the authors thirst for the Livng
Water, which provided strength and sacramental grace to live out his
calling (vocation). Every person is called by God to fill a co-creative
relationship and live out this vocation through drinking from the Lords
cup of Living Water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader will enter dialogue with God and him or her selves through
reviewing the living Word of Scriptures which reach out to all of Creation
the love, understanding, and divine mercy of the Divine Father. Man was
created in Gods image and likeness. God also gave man a free-will to
either accept or reject this divine calling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapters cover the uniqueness of the human being which God created
and equipped him/her with VISION and Memory with which to serve
God and neighbor; through these special God given human/divine senses
through which require communication and Befriending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader will become informed as to the role of every Baptized Christian;
that is of a Spiritual Guide. This term is inherent with any calling by
God. We all share, to some degree responsibility of Befriending even
those in our own homes. To this end a complete description of Faithing
and Befriending will be utilized in the formation process of the Spiritual
Guide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author concludes with 29 Stories for the use of individuals or groups
of individuals in home group meetings. This Faithing process is also
covered. The book closes with 10 groups of spiritual direction questions;
which again can be done individually or in small groups at home. &lt;/p&gt;" />
