  <title>An Introduction to the Bible and Theology - John Heywood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The series of studies in this book came about as a result of a concern to see Gods people equipped to implement his purposes in the area in which they live. Not everyone has the opportunity to study full-time, and these studies are flexible enough to be useful either as a study guide or as a reference book. They were originally written to train Christians in the local church situation and have now been revised and reformatted in order to provide an accessible introduction to Christian doctrine and other matters for all who wish to study but cannot attend a bible college. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various chapters will enable the student to approach the Bible in such a way as to have a proper understanding of the text and the truth that it reveals to us. There is an introduction to the historical situations of the biblical period and their relationship to the world of that time. Space is also given to summarizing the content of each biblical book in order to provide an overview, helping you to see the big picture. In each study of a particular doctrine, the emphasis is on what the Bible teaches and the place of a personal God with whom we can have a living relationship through Jesus Christ his Son.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Each chapter is complete in itself and is written in plain English, with technical terms explained where necessary. They provide a foundation upon which the student can build to whatever level is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
