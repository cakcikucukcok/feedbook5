  <title>Christian Soldiers - Winston Abrams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered why individuals who claim to have a personal relationship with a Holy God, through His Son Jesus Christ; sometimes perform some of the most unholy acts?  Or, why a brother or sister that has faithfully walked with Lord for many years, backslides into the world of sin and degradation?  Or, why individuals that have been in ministries or positions in the church for many years, ends up committing gross sins.  Or, maybe you  whom you know, loves the Lord dearly  ends up failing him miserably, by committing a sin you never though possible.  Maybe you struggle with a besetting sin, which grieves your heart every time you give into its lure and temptation, but you do have a desire to please the Lord - simply because you love Him. This book answers these and many other questions by showing, from scriptures, what is required to live as our Lord and Savior commands.  He said Be ye Holy, for I am Holy.  Our master deserves no less; for He has also admonished us:  Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.  Praise His Holy name; for He alone deserves all honor, all glory and all praise!  This book is not a quick fix.  On the contrary, it shows from the Word of God, the simple, practical means which our loving heavenly father has laid out for us, His children, to have lasting victory over the flesh, the world, and the devil; who are every second of the day conspiring to make us fail the masters Holy name.  The scripture calls it denying self.  In a word  Discipline!
Winston Abrams  a sinner saved by grace!
But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.  								Romans 5:20" />
