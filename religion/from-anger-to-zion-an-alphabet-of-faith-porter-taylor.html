  <title>From Anger to Zion: An Alphabet of Faith - Porter Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anger, judgment, forgiveness, wisdom. All of these and more are biblical words we&#39;ve used so often that they have very little meaning for us anymore. For others--seekers and those who are coming to church for the first time--these words sound like jargon. They are words that divide new church members from those who have been there a lifetime. In From Anger to Zion, Porter Taylor reflects on an alphabet of biblical words in ways that will help newcomers understand and speak the language, and that will encourage those familiar with these words to rethink them.   A wonderful storyteller and writer, Taylor&#39;s essays, each based on a biblical text, take ancient words and ideas and bring them into contemporary life. Egypt of old is today&#39;s broken place in our lives-the place where, like Moses, God is most likely to call us to go. Forgiveness is explored as a way of unfreezing time; without forgiveness we cannot grow. What does Isaiah&#39;s and the Israelites&#39; homesickness have to do with today&#39;s homeless and lost people?   These beautifully written essays are wonderful devotional material, but they also can serve as material for preparing to preach or for small-group discussion within parish reading groups." />
