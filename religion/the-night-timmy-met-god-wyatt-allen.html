  <title>The Night Timmy Met God - Wyatt Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You have to ask yourself, do you believe in God? Do you believe that there is an all-powerful being that created all that you are and all that surrounds you? And if there is, why is he so elusive? And why does he let bad things happen to good people?  
These are just a few questions that a twelve-year-old little boy whose name is Timmy asked himself and others. He was not able to get a straight answer from anyone and not able to ask his mother and father. Because they were still harboring unforgiveness in their hearts from losing their daughter, Timmys sister, Cindy, to a tragic accident. Timmys determined to find out all that he can about the Supreme Being. He decided to go straight to the source, asking God himself. 
One night, while Timmy was lying on the roof of his house where he went to say his prayers, he noticed a shooting star. After making a wish on it to meet God, Timmy fell asleep on his roof, only to be awoken by our Lord Jesus Christ standing there, waiting to grant his wish by taking him to heaven.
After Timmy arrived in heaven, to his overwhelming joy, his sister was there waiting to greet him. Not only does Timmy get to experience all the wonders in heaven but he gets to spend time with his sister. And ultimately, he does in fact get to meet God." />
