  <title>3 Swords - Japonica F. Edmonds Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Japonica F. Edmonds Smith is a seasoned writer of poetry, prose, and inspirational short stories. In Gods now latter blessings rain! I shall continue to seek the Father in order to give His people divine revelation in their thoughts as well as in their walk within their lives. It is the Father Jehovah that inspires us spiritually to draw the reader inward, in order to have an intimate walk within our heart to walk with Him. 
It is without question that it is God who awakens ones heart to seek His son, Jesus. It is He that wants His plan and purpose to be fulfilled in our lives and to show us that in the midst of life trials, there is still a word from the Father. God has always been concerned about you, the saints of God in Christ Jesus. He loves you with an everlasting love. He showed humanity His agape love, when He thought it not robbery to give His Son, Jesus, to take our place, by being on the cross. That was designed for the sins of humanity  each and every one of us individually! 
Thank God for His Son! We have been redeemed by His blood!
IT IS FINISHED! 
His immeasurable love raised Jesus from the dead. Hallelujah! For He sent forth His Son that we might have life and life that more abundantly, so that we will have true intimacy, fellowship, communion, and relationship with Jesus. After all is said and done, after we have repented, we shall have true forgiveness from our sins, thereby receiving healing, growth, and restoration for ourselves as we restore love to one another with forgiveness!
With the sword of the spirit in my mouth, I decree as well as command, that I am a victorious woman of God, without any constraints to do the will of the Father Jehovah in Jesus name. Amen! It is Gods will for all the saints of God to seek and to save those who are lostto teach the found to go after the lost, so that all shall be saved and none perish.&lt;p&gt;" />
