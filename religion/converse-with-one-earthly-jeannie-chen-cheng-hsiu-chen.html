  <title>Converse with One Earthly - Jeannie Chen, Cheng Hsiu Chen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A book differs from a person in that one is dead and another alive. The need to be consistent with oneself is one of the five merits discussed in chapter 7. A person needs to attempt on achieving consistency on all fronts, but a book does not need to. The inconsistency within this book demonstrates the consistency of authors to reveal all truth, including our stages of spiritual growth. 
An outline of this book is provided after the last chapter. Textbooks in schools and colleges should have similar outlines appended to help the study. The writing of outlines has not received enough attention in school that most students still write one paragraph before outlining. Writing paragraphs sequentially should only occur when one does not have a clear sight of what to write and have only vague and general ideas. Outlining should be done at least 95 percent of the time." />
