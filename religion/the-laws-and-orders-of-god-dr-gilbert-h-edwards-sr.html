  <title>The Laws and Orders of God - Dr. Gilbert H. Edwards Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have searched and surveyed the Books of the Pentateuch and found many Laws that God has set forth in the beginning. God also set the orders. God has placed in order the food diet.
Mans most sacred privilege is freedom of will; the ability to obey or disobey his maker. This sharp limitation of self-gratification, this dietary law, was to test the use he would make of his freedom; and it thus begins the moral discipline of man. Unlike the beast, man has also a spiritual life, which demands the subordination of mans desires to the Law of God. The will of God revealed in His Law is the one eternal and unfailing guide as to what constitutes good and evil, and not mans instincts, or even his reason, which in the hour of temptation often will light darkness and darkness light. These laws and orders that he wills out and tries to the best of his ability to explain, is to be obeyed until God says otherwise. The author will point out other laws and orders in this book." />
