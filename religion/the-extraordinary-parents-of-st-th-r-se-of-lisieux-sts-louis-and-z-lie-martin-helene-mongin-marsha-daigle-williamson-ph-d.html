  <title>The Extraordinary Parents of St. Thérèse of Lisieux: Sts. Louis and Zélie Martin - Helene Mongin, Marsha Daigle-Williamson, Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="St. Therese famously said, &lt;i&gt;&quot;God gave me a Father and Mother more worthy of Heaven than of Earth.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, 2015, Louis and Zelie Martin will be the first married couple to be canonized together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they met, fell in love, and married in 1858, their lives seemed pretty ordinary. They worked hard-Louis was a watchmaker, Zelie established her own business making  Pont d&#39;Alencon lace-and went on to have nine children. Five survived, all of whom became nuns and one of whom is now known as St. Therese of Lisieux, perhaps the most popular saint in recent history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through stories, chatty domestic insights from Zelie&#39;s correspondence, and running commentary on their faith and family, &lt;b&gt;The Extraordinary Parents of St. Therese of Lisieux&lt;/b&gt; shows in vivid detail how Louis and Zelie created a joyful Catholic home for their family while coping with the demands of business and  the daily stresses of ordinary life with their lively children." />
