  <title>&quot;One Holy Local Church&quot;? - Bojidar Marinov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The concept of &amp;ldquo;local church membership&amp;rdquo; hardly existed in the church before the 17th century Baptists, except for certain heretical sects and Anabaptists. Yes, the concept of &amp;ldquo;church membership&amp;rdquo; has existed from the very beginning. The concept of &amp;ldquo;local congregation&amp;rdquo; has existed from the very beginning. The theology of &amp;ldquo;there is no salvation outside the church&amp;rdquo; has existed from the very beginning; hence, the command for Christians to &amp;ldquo;join the church&amp;rdquo; in a covenant, which is the Covenant of Grace. That joining the Church, though, was done through the same means a man joined the Covenant of Grace: baptism. Through baptism, man joined the universal Church. The modern church, through a combination of political pressure and a move by&amp;nbsp;church leaders to insulate themselves from accountability, has led to the widespread adoption of &amp;quot;local church membership&amp;quot; and related practices over the past century or so by non-Baptists as well. But this was not the way of the early church, Christendom, or the Reformation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
