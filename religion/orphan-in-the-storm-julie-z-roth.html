  <title>Orphan in the Storm - Julie Z. Roth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is my own story of how I overcame unbelievable poverty and neglect. I was told by my dad that I wasnt even worth educating, yet I managed to escape the torment of shame and guilt to become a top wage earner in the Information Age, and excelled beyond my own expectations in college. Its the story of Dads death at only forty-one, leaving Mom with five children, two months pregnant with number six, a half-built house with no indoor plumbing, no water supply, a stick-shift Chevy that she couldnt drive, a $2,000 life insurance policy, and nothing in the bank. Its the story of how our Heavenly Father came to our rescue with one miracle after another to keep us safe and together when we, by all appearances, were destined to doom. Its my personal testimony of the many supernatural experiences that have no other explanation than simply miracles.&lt;/p&gt;" />
