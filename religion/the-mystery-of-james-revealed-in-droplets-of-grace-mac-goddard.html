  <title>The Mystery of James Revealed in Droplets of Grace - Mac Goddard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Mystery of James Revealed in Droplets of Grace&lt;/i&gt; is Pastor Mac Goddards attempt to offer a view of the book of James, through daily meditations that he calls droplets of grace. Early in his ministry, Pastor Goddard read the book of James in the same manner he read the rest of the Biblethrough the lenses of legalism, attempting to learn the rules of the Christian life, so he could please God and make it safely to Heaven. As a result, he really struggled with the book of James, finding it impossible to reconcile with the writings of Paul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is not alone among scholars in this difficulty; Martin Luther, the iconic figure of the Protestant Reformation, also struggled with the book of James. Somewhere in Pastor Goddards journey, however, it became clear to him that he desperately needed to change his spiritual glasses so that he could read the Bible through the lens of graceGods unmerited favor. The difference was remarkable. Instead of bringing confusion and doubt, his study of the book of James brought life, peace, and freedom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Mystery of James Revealed in Droplets of Grace&lt;/i&gt; examines the meaning of each of the ideas brought forth in the book of James in daily meditations that present the verses and then explore explanations of each. You too can come to grips with the book of James through these droplets of grace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
