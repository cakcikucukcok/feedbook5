  <title>The Autobiography of Satan - John Relly Beard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John Relly Beard (1800-1876) was an English Unitarian minister who wrote more than thirty books in his lifetime, including &amp;quot;The Life of Toussaint L&amp;#39;Ouverture&amp;quot; in 1853 and several reference volumes on a variety of topics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His masterpiece &amp;quot;The Autobiography of Satan&amp;quot; was published in 1872 and the goal of the book is clearly described during the Preface: &amp;#39;As this book is intended not so much for scholars as the general public, I have not attempted more than a series of readable sketches. The same consideration has led me to adopt the autobiographical form, which, with the supposition of an intelligent companion, gives me some of the advantages of a conversational style. Only in the large portion of the work devoted to the Scriptures have I, without departing from a popular manner, aimed at a certain degree of completeness. To handle adequately all the grave topics of this comprehensive theme would require a library instead of a volume.&amp;#39;" />
