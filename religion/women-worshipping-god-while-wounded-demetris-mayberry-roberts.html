  <title>Women Worshipping God While Wounded - Demetris Mayberry Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I greet you in the name of our Lord.
God had a plan for me. Though I pondered, he still made preparations and gives confirmation. I had no idea where or how to start, but God already had it in his plan. He had given me the tools; I just needed to open the toolbox. I found my pen (screwdriver) and the hammer (scriptures). Women Worshipping God While Wounded was birth through women that have been through the storm and came out with fascinating, stimulating, and encouraging testimonies and stories of purpose. Its not about me or you, but its his plan that will prevail. No matter what your leaking issues are (spiritual warfare, the marriage on the verge of breaking up, that man that left you, the friend that looked the other way, being the victim), give them to God. Dont give up on your dreams, goals, or visions, and when God brings you out, share the good news. Get some new friends (Deborah, a renowned prophetess and judge, the woman God used, or Esther, the woman who saved the Jews). Your background does not determine what God can do with you. God never forgets our labor of love (like Ruth, who was loyal to Naomi and faithful to God).
Dont live your life as the world turns on the edge of night. May the grace of God push you into your next destiny." />
