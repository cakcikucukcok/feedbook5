  <title>Psalms (Vol. 1) - Charles H. Spurgeon, J. I. Packer, Alister Mcgrath, J. I. Packer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years Christendom has been blessed with Bible commentaries written by great men of God highly respected for their godly walk and their insight into spiritual truth.

In these busy days, it would be greatly to the spiritual profit of Christians if they were more familiar with the Book of Psalms, in which they would find a complete armory for life&#39;s battles, and a perfect supply for life&#39;s needs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
