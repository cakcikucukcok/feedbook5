  <title>The Shape of Participation: A Theology of Church Practices - L. Roger Owens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Shape of Participation is a work of constructive theology addressed to theologians, seminarians, and thoughtful pastors. Owens engages and deepens recent popular discussions of church practices by approaching practices from the church Fathers&#39; understanding of the church&#39;s participation in God. Through a wide-ranging engagement with theologians, both ancient and contemporary--including Cyril of Alexandria, Maximus the Confessor, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and Herbert McCabe--Owens argues that the embodied practices of the church are the church&#39;s participation in the life of God, making the church Jesus&#39; own continued, peaceable embodiment in and for the world. This book is for theologians, pastors, and anyone who wants a deeper understanding of how the visible presence of God&#39;s church is extraordinarily good news in a violent world." />
