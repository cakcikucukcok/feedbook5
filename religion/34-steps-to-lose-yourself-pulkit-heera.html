  <title>34 Steps to Lose Yourself - Pulkit Heera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pulkit Heera or Dr Pulkit is someone who is a little difficult to describe. Professionally a Consultant Eye Surgeon, a reviewer for British and Indian Journals and a speaker at Medicine conferences worldwide; Pulkit looks the part of a white collared professional. But, this is where the story just begins. Since childhood, he has had an unquenchable thirst to learn everything possible, meet new people every day and a weakness for celebrations. The Doctor is- proficient in Indian instrumental classical music, western vocals, is an amateur Guitarist, loves lawn tennis, is an expert swimmer, sketches, is an actor and screenwriter in upcoming Bollywood movies, a mimic and a stage lover, a poet, a renowned orator, a fierce competitor in debates and also an Author. Heera believes in laughing at and looking at everything through a different perspective, a perspective which embosses its beauty, humor and positivity.
Infatuatory Warning: This book contains no heavy stuff that may be dreaded. We are about to have a fun chit-chat about stuff. 
Havent we had enough of rules, lectures and discourses in our lives, telling us what to do and what not? I hate rules as much as you do. Lets break stereotypes and look at life through an alternate perspective, which makes it funny to downright hilarious.
Sit down with our steaming coffee mugs and do something we did not have to learn about at school. Talk from our hearts. No need to read this book back to back; flip through, pick any page, no need to be bound by chapter rules. What do you wanna talk about-Love, Commitment Phobia, Social Network, Sociobrats, Mockuscript, Who is God?, Nagging Questions, Grasshopper lover, Indian Arranged Marriage, Sex etc.
Genre? We shall create a genre of our own." />
