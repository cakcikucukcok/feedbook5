  <title>I’M a Christian Too! - Bud Fennell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When people become Christian, their lives will reflect the salvation they possess. Certainly the Bible doesnt teach otherwise. The reason we dont see new life reflected in the lives of so many professing Christians is that they dont have it! But how could one know? The apostle Paul wrote: Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you-unless, of course, you fail the test (2 Corinthians 13:5). So there must be some sort of a test, something to look at in the life of a professing Christian that would give some evidence as to whether or not he or she is a genuine or counterfeit believer. What is it? Are we going to talk about works for salvation? Of course not! But God is about giving us the confidence that Christ is in us. God is not suggesting that we examine ourselves to see if we can pass a test for salvation, but rather, God has us look at the evidence in our lives of salvation. Is there any in your life? If you were accused of being a Christian in a land where it was illegal and you were brought to trial, would there be enough evidence to find you guilty as charged! or would you be acquitted? Think about it. Is there anything unique about you that looks Christian? What might that look like? Thats what this book is about. Therefore, it seems it would behoove every professing Christian to give some thought to what Ive written in this book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
