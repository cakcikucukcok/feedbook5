  <title>The Spiritual Principals of True Free-Dom - Jimmy Cameron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Incarceration is the place where people can reflect on their past decisions they made in life. However, in spite of this, the majority of those who find themselves in prison are not willing to rehabilitate themselves and face the realities of how they got there. Pointing the finger at someone else is a tactic for those who don&amp;#39;t want to take responsibility for their own actions, not realizing that the thought is the cause of it all. Blame, something that started with the father and mother of the Human family, Adam and Eve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are some who challenge this behavior. These are the minority who, during their prison bid (Blessing In Disguise), take heed unto themselves and the choices they made that drove them to this life behind fences. Jimmy Cameron is one of the minority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first met Jimmy, he asked me to assist him with completing his writings, I quickly recognized him as one of the Christians at the facility. His level of compassion and sincerity for teaching the Gospel was not something I was in any position to judge. My job was to help him make his ideas clear and improve the way he presented them on paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What caught me out the gate about Jimmy was his genuine love, and enthusiasm of this Truth, that he had for preaching this message to people who he knew would benefit from it. Being in bondage in his earlier life to drugs and drug-related activity, Jimmy knows from experience how slippery that path is and how it&amp;#39;s almost impossible to halt a slide upon it once it has started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in reconnecting back to God, Jimmy has found the way to break that vicious cycle, and is willing to share his experience, strength, and hope with others and this is what moves him to write. And write. And write.&lt;/p&gt;" />
