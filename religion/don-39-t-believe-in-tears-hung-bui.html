But when he forces himself to accept a job from his father in law, also is his boss, which is made for him to return his birth city in Viet Nam where hes going to work with his Uncle Tim whose is President of Eastern Bank to clinch an important contract has been arranged. His entire world suddenly has changed and his life turns upside down by quirk fate when he accidentally bumps into a woman outside of the airport, who resembles his dead wife, and then following her to where she works. More astonishing is shes an employee of Eastern Bank, also is his uncles secretary. His heart turns over and quickly in love after knowing her name is Ngan.
Getting closer to Ngan and trying to win her heart, Brian intrigues with his uncle to take a mailman job instead to disguise his character. And from there, they became more than just colleagues, but as so often happens in times of need friendships are forged, and after Brian is acting as an actor to pretend Ngans beau to visit her family, and then secretly helps Ngan to rework her project. They are each surprised at the intimacy of their working and spending days and the impact their encounter brings: Warm, crying, laughing, witty, and as wise as ever. Theyre falling madly in love and Brian has to return to Viet Nam to get married Ngan.
With a happy ending when Ngan is immigrated to America at last, Brian has a different thought about the fate that God has created. Having Ngan in his life, as if God has brought Jennies life back on earth for reuniting with him that makes Brian doesnt believe in tears which is he has been crying for, and learning along the meaning of true love, and ultimately, what fate really is." />
