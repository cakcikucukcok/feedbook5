  <title>Restored by Truth - Donna Kay Ashley Pleasants</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you in need of restoration or spiritual and physical training? Are you dealing with something that keeps you stuck or habitually wandering in a personal wilderness or desert? Do you find yourself always trying to feel satisfied by overeating or overspending? Are you feeling spiritually or physically fatigued? Do you feel its too late for change to take place in your life? Have you thought about what kind of legacy that you are leaving for your children? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have something to overcome as a result of the consequences of sin, broken relationships, dysfunctional upbringing, or possibly unhealthy eating habits. All can be the results of our apathetic spiritual or physical training. Whatever is keeping you in that personal desert of brokenness can be defeated, and you can be completely restored. Restoration starts from the inside out, and it begins in your mind and processed in your heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to start with the truth, which is the Word of God; it is a compass that can guide you out of your wilderness. This is a simple study to start the process of restoration that begins with basic biblical principles that you might have been taught as a child, but that were lost as you became distracted with the worlds business, causing you to wander further into your personal desert. It can also be a reinforcement to remind you of Gods plan for your life and of His faithfulness. Dont be like the Israelites and maintain a life of rebellion, dissatisfaction, and disobedience, continuing through life without direction. This is a tool that can teach you how to strengthen your spiritual and physical muscles to overcome dissatisfaction and fulfill the need to overeat.&lt;/p&gt;" />
