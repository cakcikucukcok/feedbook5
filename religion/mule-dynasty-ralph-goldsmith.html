  <title>Mule Dynasty - Ralph Goldsmith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book explains how one perceives their own life. This perspective may be completely void of truth and full of misconceptions. You will discover how God intervenes in your life when you don&#39;t even realize it. Even Christians can be deceived. You will read how I was walking alone with insecurities not knowing God was using my insecurities to advance His will in my life. You will learn that the still small voice that spoke to me as a child I never hardened my heart to. This has helped me in every step of my life. I learned that God will use you if you have a handicap. The goal is to follow that still small voice. Sometimes when you are over confident about your own abilities it is very easy to trust in your understanding. This is using human wisdom instead of God&#39;s leading hand. I hope that this book will teach you to trust in the still small voice and let God direct your paths. Trust and obey for there&#39;s no other way, to be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
