  <title>A Song of Humanity: A Science - Based Alternative to the World&#39;s Scriptures - Only One Man</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE WORLD&#39;S SCRIPTURES contain stories that our ancestors used to explain and teach things that they did not understand. Today, billions of people still believe in and dogmatically promulgate the stories and explanations the ancients recorded. Since those scriptures were written, scientists from all over the world have discovered the real answers to the questions the ancients faced. A Song of Humanity is a lyrical summary of what we Wise Men (Homo Sapiens) have learned about our universe, our world and we ourselves. Many chapters end with open-ended questions inviting readers to clarify their thoughts and beliefs. Practical advice for modern understanding and living weaves its way throughout this handbook for understanding where we came from, who we are, and where we are going." />
