  <title>The New Fulfilled the Old - Dr. Joseph Ajao Apostle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many books are out there that touched nations with powerful  impact, with biblical divine 
insight  and with progressive encouragement to all that dare to read and believe. Those  books spurs 
many people to take positive actions about their lives. Kudos to you all the great authors that made it 
possible for  the needy people to receive help through self-help  books which is the best help. Apostle, 
Dr Joseph O. Ajao&#39;s  intention in this book is to bring the testimonies of the real people  that faced real 
problems but stood their grounds and received breakthrough  to you. Why? Because the problems did 
not break them but built them up successfully. The Apostle, Dr. Joseph Olutunde Ajao has done it again 
as he did in his former book that he wrote many years ago &quot;The New Fulfilled The Old. The proven 
evidence that Jesus Christ  fulfilled the Scriptures. In his book, God can turn it around for you. With God 
all things will be possible. He proved once again that miracles have not ceased as many people believed 
now that miracles have  stopped happening (See: John 4:48; Mark 2:12; Luke 1:37; Jeremiah 32:27; 
Jeremiah 33:3; Jeremiah 1:12; Psalm 50:15; Mark 11:22-25). He theologically, biblically and 
inspirationally proved his point beyond every reasonable doubt that God can perform His miracles in 
your life if you believe that the Almighty God called Yahweh can do it right now. The promises of 
miracles stand forever up till eternity by the power of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ more 
than two thousand years ago. If you read his book without any liberal theological goggle, you shall 
understand and agree that Yahweh can turn your life around for good. For with Almighty God nothing 
will be impossible (See: Luke 1:37; Luke 18:27;  Matthew 18:18-20; Isaiah 40:8; Isaiah 42:8; Psalm 81:10 ." />
