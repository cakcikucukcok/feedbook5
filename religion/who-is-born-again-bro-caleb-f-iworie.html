  <title>Who Is Born Again? - Bro Caleb F. Iworie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All Bible quotations herein are taken from the King James Version of the Bible. If you diligently desire to know the truth about our profession in Christ Jesus, it is highly recommended that you prayerfully read and study this revealing and inspiring book manual alongside your Holy Bible. My prayer is that God opens your understanding and revelation.
I am so glad that the dynamics and the mechanics of this revealed truth, which has been pulsating within me over a period of time, is now made manifest this day to bring the true teaching to Gods children all over the world.
To a greater extent, inspirations in this booklet stem from the vindicated teachings of Gods prophet messenger, William Branham.
I trust that you will prayerfully and diligently get answers to knowing the basic fundamental truth of the Gospel by carefully studying this booklet.
You can order it online through Amazon, eBay, Google, bookshops, and churches.
Seeing that ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently (1 Peter 1:2022).
God bless you!" />
