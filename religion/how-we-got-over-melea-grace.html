  <title>How We Got Over - Melea Grace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How We Got Over was written to proclaim to all that there is hope in God. Whatever your hurdle, you can get over it by the Word of God. Melea Grace has shared her story, applying the principles of God in a way that all can benefit from. This book was written in devotional style, enabling the reader to digest small amounts at a time. You will be encouraged by each devotion, finding renewed strength and confidence. The resounding message of growing in faith, knowledge, and wisdom through affliction is evident throughout.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a testimony to the faithfulness of God. As you read, you will glean many things that will help you overcome the tests and trials that come to all of us in life. It is full of the Word of God with many scriptural references, which encourage you to trust in your Father God no matter what circumstances you are facing. It is also a testimony to the grace and mercy of God. I recommend this book to all who may be going through challenges  it will inspire you to trust in God, and in His Word.&lt;p&gt;
