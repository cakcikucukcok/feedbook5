  <title>The Deafening Cadence of Biblical Defection - Robert Delich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Deafening Cadence of Biblical Defection is more than a revelation of personal encounter. It is a written observation of the world, not as I see it, but as it truly is. Each chapter is a true-to-life account surrounding some of the most troublesome historicity of the Christian Church, all the way up to the more menacing tentacles of the anti-Christian movement in America. Of particular mention are the biased leftist media, inaccurate political propaganda from the film industry, the selling of militant humanism in our schools, political correctness, and a liberal court system that finds it appropriate to assist and legitimize Scriptural abominations into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showing little regard for the Word of God, these anti-Christian agencies have become a menacing, parasitic force tearing at the very fabric of Christian ideology and the moral stability of America. The question is, what kind of world will we assign to the next generation if mans self-serving, immoral inequities are the measuring tool that represents final authority? Important to this work is the presentation of the one true God as delineated throughout the Old and New Testament. It is by this method understanding and resolutions for conceptual issues in this book emerge. In the end, the book answers one of the most reigning questions corroborated throughout each chapter, and that is, can Christianity as we know it survive in a society that vilifies anything that represents Christian symbolic ideology?&lt;br /&gt;
