  <title>Inbound Miracles - Clarence Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One thing I can guarantee you...you will not be disappointed by reading this book.
It will surpass all your expectations.
You will then realize that you have a sense of purpose.
His words regarding my faith and hopefully this book will cause people to wonder as to Why we have more faith in science than the GOD who made the sciences and given them the knowledge to treat our symptoms and without any real cures insight ,because that isnt profitable for any curable illness which shouldnt have no affect on our beliefs and faith that many can be heal without no limits in sight. GOD is still GOD of the universe and knows us better then we know or known by others as our years pass
And with the miracles He provides hasnt caught on with the children of the King yet but I do believe with all my heart and soul that when the time is right and we are challenged we as a people of GOD has risen to the occasions and brought honor to CHRIST JESUS and the FATHER. I would like to dedicate this book to a women to whom the LORD hadnt support me with her prayers and support in every fashion of the word and My best friend beside the LORD and I give thanks to her on behalf of the LORD and myself. AND MAYBE THE LORD WILL BLESS SOME OTHER TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND MY GOD BE MANIFIED AND GLORIFIED FOR WHAT HE HAS INSTILL WITHIN ME , AND THE ANSWER TO QUESTION ISNT AS FAR AS WE THINK BUT, STANDING BESIDES US JUST WAITING TO BE USED." />
