  <title>Re-Introducing Christianity: An Eastern Apologia for a Western Audience - Amir Azarvan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Faith means making a virtue out of not thinking. . . . And those who preach faith, and enable and elevate it are intellectual slaveholders, keeping mankind in a bondage to fantasy and nonsense that has spawned and justified so much lunacy and destruction.&quot; -- Bill Maher  Many seem unaware that contemporary critiques of Christianity are relevant mostly to its modern offshoots (whose followers have to some extent earned Bill Maher&#39;s unflattering caricatures). To its detriment, Christianity is increasingly identified in people&#39;s minds with these more recent expressions. As a result, a growing number of people are turning away from Christianity and, indeed, religious faith altogether.  Drawing from an eclectic group of theologians, clergy members, monastics, and lay scholars, this edited volume re-introduces Christianity to a modern audience. It presents a more authentic, experiential side of Christianity to the religious skeptic; a side that eschews blind faith, legalism, and judgment; a side that is rarely given a hearing in the ongoing debate with today&#39;s skeptics.   Re-Introducing Christianity is also directed at modern Christians, and refutes their most frequently expressed criticisms of what the contributors boldly, but humbly, call the Apostolic Faith." />
