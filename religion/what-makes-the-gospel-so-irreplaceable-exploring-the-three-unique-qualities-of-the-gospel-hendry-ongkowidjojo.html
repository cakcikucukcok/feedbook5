  <title>What Makes the Gospel So Irreplaceable: Exploring the Three Unique Qualities of the Gospel - Hendry Ongkowidjojo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every Christian must not be ashamed to affirm that Jesus is the only Savior of the world. Here are the difficulties: How we can say that, when we do not even know how many other existing religions there are? And besides, isn&#39;t God all-loving? Isn&#39;t love all that matters in salvation? What hinders God from saving as many people through as many ways as possible?   We will find the answers in Romans 1:16-17, when we are exploring what Paul has said about the Gospel and its three unique qualities: it is powerful, it displays God&#39;s righteousness, and it is received by faith alone. Once we grasp these, and once we put love and righteousness hand in hand, we will understand why our salvation can be so firm and why the Gospel is so irreplaceable no matter what." />
