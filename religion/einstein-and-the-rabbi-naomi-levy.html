  <title>Einstein and the Rabbi - Naomi Levy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the 2017 Nautilus Award in the Religion/Spirituality of Western Thought category &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bestselling author and rabbi&#39;s profoundly affecting exploration of the meaning and purpose of the soul, inspired by the famous correspondence between Albert Einstein and a grieving rabbi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;A human being is part of the whole, called by us &#39;Universe,&#39; a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts, and feelings as something separate from the rest--a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness...&quot; --Albert Einstein&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Rabbi Naomi Levy came across this poignant letter by Einstein it shook her to her core. His words perfectly captured what she has come to believe about the human condition: That we are intimately connected, and that we are blind to this truth. Levy wondered what had elicited such spiritual wisdom from a man of science? Thus began a three-year search into the mystery of Einstein&#39;s letter, and into the mystery of the human soul. What emerges is an inspiring, deeply affecting book for people of all faiths filled with universal truths that will help us reclaim our own souls and glimpse the unity that has been evading us. We all long to see more expansively, to live up to our gifts, to understand why we are here. Levy leads us on a breathtaking journey full of wisdom, empathy and humor, challenging us to wake up and heed the voice calling from within--a voice beckoning us to become who we were born be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
