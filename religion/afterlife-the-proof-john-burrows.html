  <title>Afterlife-the Proof - John Burrows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Afterlife really does exist. There is a tremendous amount of evidence proving that it is so. Some of the more convincing evidence comes from the Scole experiments, proxy sittings, and solid materializations. All of this evidence proves that the personality lives on and that when we die we will meet our loved ones again. There is No Death. I am standing on the seashore. A ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean. She is an object of beauty and strength, and I stand and watch her until at length she is a speck of white cloud just where the sea and sky come to mingle with each other. Then someone at my side sys &quot;There, she&#39;s gone&quot;. Gone where? Gone from my sight, that is all. She is just as large in mass and hull and spar as she was when she left my side, and she is just as able to bear her load of living weight to her destined harbour." />
