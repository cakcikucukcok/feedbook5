  <title>Hold Your Horses - D. A. Cleland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do we have a case of MISTAKEN IDENTITY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For generations, the image of the four horsemen&lt;br /&gt;
of the apocalypse has captured the imagination&lt;br /&gt;
of Bible interpreters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Front and centre is the rider on the Black Horse &amp;ndash; usually depicted as a mysterious skeletal figure, draped in a black hooded robe, holding out a pair of scales in his thin bony hand, unleashing famine on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is this picture correct?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While researching the meaning of &amp;lsquo;barley&amp;rsquo; in Scripture, D.A. Cleland discovered the rabbinical tradition linking &amp;lsquo;barley&amp;rsquo; to God&amp;rsquo;s deliverance from hunger and death, and His abundant provision. Cleland observed that there is a consistent pattern that is evident not only in the Old Testament but continues throughout the New Testament, leading to the re-evaluation of Revelation 6 in the light of the &amp;lsquo;Law of First Mention&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Presented here is a fresh new reading on the four horsemen, drawing on the entire biblical text. Highlighted is the importance of the &amp;lsquo;denarius&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;balances&amp;rsquo; which prove to be the two symbols that are the essential keys confirming without a doubt who rides the mysterious Black Horse of Revelation!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is believed that this is the first book published that uses the interpretative approach of the &amp;lsquo;Law of First Mention&amp;rsquo; to ascertain what the symbols of the Four Horsemen of Revelation signify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do we have a case of MISTAKEN IDENTITY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For generations, the image of the four horsemen&lt;br /&gt;
