  <title>This Momentary Marriage - John Piper, No&amp;euml;l Piper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on forty years of matrimony, John Piper exalts the biblical meaning of marriage over its emotion, exhorting couples to keep their covenant for all the best reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even in the days when people commonly stayed married &quot;&#39;til death do us part,&quot; there has never been a generation whose view of marriage was high enough, says Pastor John Piper. That is all the more true in our casual times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though personal selfishness and cultural bondage obstruct the wonder of God&#39;s purpose, it is found in God&#39;s Word, where his design can awaken a glorious vision capable of freeing every person from small, Christ-ignoring, romance-intoxicated views. As Piper explains in reflecting on forty years of matrimony: &quot;Most foundationally, marriage is the &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; of God. And ultimately, marriage is the &lt;em&gt;display&lt;/em&gt; of God. It displays the covenant-keeping love between Christ and his people to the world in a way that no other event or institution does. Marriage, therefore, is not mainly about being in love. It&#39;s mainly about telling the truth with our lives. And staying married is not about staying in love. It is about keeping covenant and putting the glory of Christ&#39;s covenant-keeping love on display.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Momentary Marriage&lt;/em&gt; unpacks the biblical vision, its unexpected contours, and its weighty implications for married, single, divorced, and remarried alike.&lt;/p&gt;" />
