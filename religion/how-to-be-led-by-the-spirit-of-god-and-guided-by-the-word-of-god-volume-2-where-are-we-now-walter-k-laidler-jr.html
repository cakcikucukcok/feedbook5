  <title>How to Be Led By the Spirit of God and Guided By the Word of God: Volume 2 Where Are We Now? - Walter K Laidler Jr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a result of spiritual rebellion against God and living in this present age without Him, we are spiritually blind, spiritually deaf, and have spiritually blinded minds. The need for salvation from this condition is met in Jesus Christ, who is The Way, The Truth, and The Life of God. In this book, How to be Led by the Spirit of God and Guided by the Word of God, Volume Two: &quot;Where Are We Now?&quot; Bishop Laidler clarifies what religion teaches with what the bible says: 1) Are temptations, trials and tribulations really sent by God? 2) Nine effects of &quot;the curse in the earth&quot; and &quot;the curse on the ground...&quot; 3) Seven misconceptions about these two curses... 4) The effect of the curse and the carnal mind... Knowledge about these topics should radically change how you see and perceive your present situation. Through this teaching series, you will learn how to progress from your past circumstances to an overcoming lifestyle of faith in God. My grandmother&#39;s word to me, &quot;Every tub has to sit on its own bottom.&quot;" />
