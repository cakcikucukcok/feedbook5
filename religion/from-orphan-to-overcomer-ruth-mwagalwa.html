      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ruth&amp;#39;s story is one of God&amp;#39;s amazing grace and awesome power. As a child born into Ugandan poverty, Ruth was orphaned at nine years of age and passed from family to family. She suffered through Ugandan President Idi Amin&amp;#39;s rule of terror. She was raped, treated as a slave, married to a Muslim man, then widowed when he died of HIV/AIDS. Then she discovered she also had AIDS. After two years of treatment, when medications no longer offered hope, at death&amp;#39;s door and no longer able to walk, God healed her completely! Today she has an international ministry and ministers to more than 3,000 Ugandan widows and orphans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
