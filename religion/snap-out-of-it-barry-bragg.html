  <title>Snap out of It - Barry Bragg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the short but powerful book &lt;i&gt;Snap Out of It&lt;/i&gt;, author Barry Bragg invites you to discover that a questioning mind, an independent spirit, and a sense of humor are the holy trinity of spiritual sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;An honest examination of religion takes us to a place of humility, not rigid dogma or superiority. We discover, at long last, that the Universe does not behave in a way that makes us comfortable, and, in fact, is bursting with unpredictability and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;Doubt is essential, for illusion and self-deception are the hallmarks of the human mind. With wishful thinking on one end, and paranoid delusion on the other, the ability to see through these products of human imagination takes us to safety and sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;This book gives you the information and inspiration to resist the pressure to conform to &quot;shoulds,&quot; either from religion or society.  Refuse to pretend you &quot;know&quot; when you don&#39;t know. Stand tall and celebrate the gifts of your innate reason, intuition and individuality.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;If you walk a spiritual path, make sure it comes from the light of your own being, a spontaneous, personal, free-flowing, natural spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional religion tells us the word of God is true. However, if you begin with the idea that &lt;i&gt;whatever is true is the word of God,&lt;/i&gt; and make that search for yourself, you&#39;re on the journey to inner freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May this book be a source of light and liberation, and, yes, laughter. Reclaim your spiritual sanity and integrity, and know that the true will set you free.&lt;/p&gt;" />
