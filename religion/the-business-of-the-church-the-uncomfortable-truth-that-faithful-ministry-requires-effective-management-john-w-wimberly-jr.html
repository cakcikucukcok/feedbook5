  <title>The Business of the Church: The Uncomfortable Truth that Faithful Ministry Requires Effective Management - John W. Wimberly Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pastors are called to be not only leaders with vision, but also managers of congregational systems, says John Wimberly in The Business of the Church. Drawing on his thirty-six years in ordained ministry, Wimberly weaves the realities of congregational dynamics and faith-centered purpose together with practical, proven approaches to business management. A student and friend of Rabbi Edwin Friedman, Wimberly builds on Friedman&#39;s systems theory as he helps readers avoid common pitfalls and put into practice effective techniques of congregational management. The book begins with a foundational discussion of how a systems approach helps congregational managers identify areas of dysfunction and effective solutions. Managing the critical &#39;inputs&#39; of people, facilities, and finances has a direct bearing on the desired &#39;outputs&#39; of proclamation, pastoral care, and mission. A strategic plan, through which a congregation sets its goals and identifies and prioritizes resources, is an essential management tool for both pastors and lay leaders. The author&#39;s conversational writing style and many real-life examples make a seemingly complicated, mysterious topic for some an engaging and easily applicable read." />
