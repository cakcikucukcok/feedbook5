  <title>Building up the Temple - Richard Meza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To not surrender. To not avail ones faith. To believe that God has His hand upon your shoulder when you feel nothing but worry. To see and feel His warmth at the cusp of disparity. This book is the story of how a young and inexperienced pastor got to witness firsthand God manifesting Himself mightily in a small church, how the workings of the Lord on the small but spunky congregation were peculiar yet tremendous, and how the project could not have been carried out without the faith of the many people who couldnt understand the words give up. This is the story of the church of Mendota and Pastor Richard Mezas strange but undeniably wonderful experience of Gods power. The congregation of Mendota Church was made up of hardworking families who had a many years dream of building a beautiful sanctuary. They dared to believe that with prayer and fasting and a lot of hard work, they could touch Gods heart. With no money and little resources, they had been allowed by God to build a beautiful seven-thousand-square-foot sanctuary in just seven months. In the midst of much turmoil, like the pastors wife getting a brain tumor and the contractor getting a stroke, God was able to confound the wisdom of man and demonstrate that He is truly a God of miracles." />
