  <title>My Encounter with Jesus at Heaven’S Gates - Santosh (Sandy) Acharjee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered what happens to you twenty-five years, fifty years, or a hundred years from now? Where will you be, and what will you be doing? Is it possible your life doesnt end with your death, that youll live forever? Are heaven and hell real?
Meet a man who stood outside heavens gates, longing to get in, and stood before the judgment seat of Christ, seeing the flames of hell, which shook him to core.
The Bible says, Peoples are destined to die once, and after that to face judgement (Hebrews 9:27, NIV).
The book in your hands is a true story of a former Hindu who stood before Jesus, awaiting his judgment to enter the beauty of heaven or the flames of hell. Youll read more about heaven in Santoshs account and want to be there just as he did.
Jesuss words to Santosh are words to each of us on how to live with a purpose and how to ultimately enter the kingdom of heaven! Heaven is so glorious, as described from this first person account, and cant be missed!!
Share this book with your family and friends so that we can stand before Jesus as Santosh will next time.
To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joyto the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen (Jude 1:2425, NIV)." />
