  <title>&quot;Oops, I Did It Again!&quot; - Ron Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="underachiever, Function: n
: a person (as a student) who fails to achieve his or her potential or does not do as well as expected
I dont feel like a very good Christian at all. Everybody at my church seems to have it all together. Perhaps religion isnt for me after all, because Ill never be spiritual enough. 
If you share in this sentiment, then this book is for you! Im writing this book for the silent majority who has said repeatedly, Im never going to get this Christianity thing right! Imperfections, unfinished goals and sporadic failures are some of the defining characteristics of Christians. In fact, if youre looking to find Jesus, He can be found in the midst of incompetent religious leaders, burnt-out believers and moral misfits  people whose lives are far from perfect! 
In this book, you will find a practical approach to Christianity that will help you, the believer, deal with the day-to-day disappointments and shortcomings that your sin problem causes. I am thoroughly convinced that genuine faith begins by admitting that we will never completely or totally have our act together. That being said, I am in no way suggesting that we have a license to sin. This book was written to help you understand that while you are flawed and imperfect, God thinks youre beautiful, and He loves you unconditionally!" />
