Jacobite Bonnie Charles Edward Stuart was a descendant of the King of France, Charlemagne. But he had a hard time proving this fact. Records were sparse, and many people vied in contention for the Stuart crown. Bonnie Charles aspired to unite the Kingdom of God and started a Jacobite Rebellion to put a Carolingian back on the Throne of France, that had been usurped by the Capetians. Although Bonnie Charles started to build an army, he found he did not have to invade France. He merely travelled over to Versailles and had a scandalous affair with Bourbon mistress, Louise Henriette, who was the wife of Orleanist Louis Philippe I nicknamed &amp;ldquo;the Fat.&amp;rdquo; Their child became King of France during the July Revolution and emblazoned the Fleur de Lis on his Coat of Arms signifying that he was a descendant of Charlemagne. Bonnie Charles was nicknamed the &amp;ldquo;pretender king,&amp;rdquo; as was the son, Freemason Louis Philippe Joseph, who knew himself that he was an illegitimate Capetian. Voila! And so Bonnie Charles Stuart won the Jacobite Rebellion, but could not disclose his sinister victory. Hence, the secret of the Jacobites. The Orleanist &amp;ldquo;pretender king&amp;rdquo; in France actually is the legitimate Carolingian claimant to the Throne of France&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roman Catholic Prophecies about a Carolingian Scion are coming true. Read on. The Christian Kingdom may be alive and well in modern times. It is up to us to take up the gauntlet and finish our Crusade in search for higher purpose and meaning in life. Most commoners do not know that the Orleanists are the French descendants of Charlemagne, their recognized historic and rightful King of France. This secret reclamation completes, full circle round, the Revolution for God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
