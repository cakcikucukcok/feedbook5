  <title>Evil Growing, No Concern - Mark A. Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To tell you what is happening, it could be the beginning of perilous times or they are already here. Things will get bad for all. In these perilous times, I want you to think and ask why these things are happening and make you a stronger one in God. Today you might think things are OK with you. Suddenly things can change for you. 9-11 changed our country.&lt;p&gt;
Think about perilous times, what effect this can have on you and your family. You might be looking for food, water, shelter, and other things that you have now. 9-11 was a perilous time for our country as well as others. Christ foretold that perilous times will come upon the earth before his return. You and your family and children could see this time the way evil is growing. I am showing how evil is growing and you might be helping.&lt;p&gt;
