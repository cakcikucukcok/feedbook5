  <title>Removing the Sting - Pauline J. Neck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Removing the Sting&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a blend of autobiography, inspiration and encouragement. Written to bring comfort to those facing health or emotional challenges, the book contains a mosaic of stories, poetry, prayers and humour.
&lt;p&gt;The story begins by describing a young girl&#39;s life in England following World War II. In 1950, when Pauline is five years old, her mother dies following surgery to remove a brain tumor. Two years after this event, Pauline is separated from her older brother and sister, when her father sends her to live with an aunt in London. The emotional fallout from these two events causes a great deal of hurt and anger to build in this young girl&#39;s heart, preventing her from truly appreciating the kindness of the people trying to help her. All through the years growing up, marriage to her childhood sweetheart and the exciting prospects of a new life in Canada - she keeps the pain within.
&lt;p&gt;Adversity seems to attach itself to Pauline&#39;s life until April 1984 when her sister&#39;s Bible study group in England start to pray for her. Within a few short weeks, the power of prayer from half-way around the world has a dramatic effect on Pauline&#39;s life and many miraculous events occur. A time of emotional healing takes place as Pauline learns to trust in a loving God.
&lt;p&gt;Many happy successful years follow. As Pauline grows in faith, she asks God a question, &quot;What is your plan for my life Lord?&quot; God&#39;s answer to her prayer seems to be &lt;i&gt;wait&lt;/i&gt; - so she waits. She becomes quite adept at juggling church, home and work and the future looks rosy indeed.
&lt;p&gt;Following her fiftieth birthday, however, Pauline notices a gradual reduction in muscle strength, slight loss of stamina and experiences problems with balance. As the months and years pass, these gradual symptoms increase to the point where she definitely knows something is wrong. Finally in June 1998, Pauline accepts an early retirement package from her employer and goes home to rest. A year later, thanks to her sister-in-law&#39;s keen observations, Pauline is diagnosed with Parkinson&#39;s disease.
&lt;p&gt;In the months following her diagnosis, Pauline joins a support group for writers and starts to jot down ideas for keeping a positive attitude. This therapeutic exercise is undertaken not just for herself, but with the idea in mind that somehow she may be able to help other people facing similar situations.
&lt;p&gt;Pauline discovers many actual &lt;i&gt;blessings&lt;/i&gt; from having Parkinson&#39;s disease and writes about them. She develops a deeper relationship with God and begins trusting Him and thanking Him for every precious day.
&lt;p&gt;As family and friends comfort her with their love and support, Pauline again asks God for direction - gently reminding Him that she can no longer afford the luxury of waiting. His answer comes loud and clear...&lt;i&gt;WRITE!&lt;/i&gt;
Renewed in spirit and blessed with a strong faith, Pauline begins reaching out to others with words of inspiration and encouragement. Starting with a new poem, &lt;i&gt;All Our Days Belong to the Lord,&lt;/i&gt; Pauline keeps on writing until the ideas form to share her life story and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Removing the Sting&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is born.

&quot;REMOVING THE STING is a blend of autobiography, inspiration and encouragement. It contains a mosaic of stories, poetry, prayers and lots of humor. When Pauline Neck was diagnosed with Parkinson&#39;s disease in September 1999, she was determined to make the rest of her life totally meaningful.&lt;P&gt;
Drawing on her faith in God, the love of family and support of caring friends, Pauline started jotting down ideas for keeping a positive attitude. She wrote about the benefit of support groups, pet ownership, gardening, cooking, singing - in fact everything she could think of to bring encouragement to herself and others.&lt;P&gt;
A native Briton, Pauline emigrated to Canada in 1966 and has lived and worked in British Columbia for twenty-four years. She is an active member of Women and Words, a local support group for writers and attends Maple Ridge Alliance Church. Pauline is also a member of the Christian Writers Guild of California and the Maple Ridge Parkinson&#39;s support group. She says &quot;Yes!&quot; to life every day.&quot;&lt;P&gt;
