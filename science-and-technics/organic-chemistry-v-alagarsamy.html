      <meta name="description" content="Organic Chemistry - A Comprehensive Approach is a much awaited great work in the Chemistry and Pharmacy. Targeted mainly to Pharm-D &amp;amp; M. Pharmacy and B. Pharmacy students, this book will also be useful for B.Sc., as well as M.Sc., chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry students. The main objective of this book is to attract the undergraduate and post graduate students, so that they understand the basic principles of Organic Chemistry. Thus the book is aimed to eliminate the inadequacy in teaching and learning of Organic Chemistry by providing enormous information about the Organic compounds. Salient Features&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;bull; The content of the book is innovative and presented in 53 chapters, in a detailed form as per the needs of the students.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; The book has covered the entire organic chemistry, starts from origin of organic chemistry to recent developments in organic chemistry like nano chemistry, green chemistry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Describing all the aspects of Organic compounds of all type in easy to understand manner is the first of its kind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; For each chapter, a brief introduction of the individual chapter, Importance, Detailed discussion of the Basic Theory, Preparations, Reactions, Test for identification and Uses and Applications in pharmacy are discussed which reflects the title of the book, &amp;ldquo;Organic Chemistry &amp;ndash; A Comprehensive Approach&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; The principles of Organic Chemistry, which is difficult to remember by the students is described in a student friendly manner which is easy to understood and able to reproduce well in examinations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Presentation with simple and similar pattern of explanation along with chemical reactions of all compounds helps to reproduce well in examinations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
