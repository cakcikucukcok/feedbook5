  <title>Renaissance of the Subperiosteal Implant Volume I - Leonard I. Linkow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Leonard Linkow became a dentist in 1952 after graduating from New York University College of Dentistry, and soon discovered the rapidly evolving field of tooth implants. He mastered advanced implant techniques by taking existing, often inadequate American and European methods and, through trial and error, transforming them into elegant and practical systems. Consequently Dr. Linkow also became a proponent of life-improvement; he knew his work could often improve a patient&#39;s appearance and bring an end to their dental suffering. And he grew into a public relations warrior; for thirty years many vested interests of the profession strongly opposed the revolution of implant dentistry. Dr. Linkow vowed to relieve them of their bias, and at times did so single-handedly.  
Dr. Linkow has practiced in New York City throughout his career, but in the 1960s he began worldwide journeys to spread the gospel of implantology through lectures and/or surgery. He has been feted in many of the world&#39;s great cities -- Milan, Rome, Paris, Shanghai, Tokyo, Zurich.  He recounts life-long friendships with some of the most renowned, loyal and eccentric people in the dental profession. 
Dr. Linkow, a native of Brooklyn, NY, was a radio operator in the U.S. Army Air Force in the final days of World War II, was once a candidate for professional baseball, having tried out for the New York Giants under Carl Hubbel and Mel Ott, and twenty-five years later was stunned to learn he was on a list of potential nominees for the Nobel Prize in Medicine. His life has been one of tribulation and triumph." />
