  <title>The Secret Life of the Mind - Mariano Sigman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;From a world-renowned leader in neuroscience, a provocative, enthralling journey into the depths of the human mind.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Where do our thoughts come from? How do we make choices and trust our judgments? What is the role of the unconscious? Can we manipulate our dreams? In this mind-bending international bestseller, award-winning neuroscientist Mariano Sigman explores the complex answers to these and many other age-old questions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Over the course of his 20-year career investigating the inner workings of the human brain, Dr. Sigman has cultivated a remarkable interdisciplinary vision. He draws on research in physics, linguistics, psychology, education, and beyond to explain why people who speak more than one language are less prone to dementia; how infants can recognize by sight objects they&#39;ve previously only touched; how babies, even before they utter their first word, have an innate sense of right and wrong; and how we can &quot;read&quot; the thoughts of vegetative patients by decoding patterns in their brain activity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Building on the author&#39;s awe-inspiring TED talk, the cutting-edge research presented in &lt;i&gt;The Secret Life of the Mind&lt;/i&gt; revolutionizes how we understand the role that neuroscience plays in our lives, unlocking the mysterious cerebral processes that control the ways in which we learn, reason, feel, think, and dream." />
