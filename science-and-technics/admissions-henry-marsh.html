  <title>Admissions - Henry Marsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 2017 National Book Critics Circle (NBCC) Finalist,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;International Bestseller, and a Kirkus &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Nonfiction Book of 2017!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Marsh has retired, which means he&#39;s taking a thorough inventory of his life. His reflections and recollections make &lt;i&gt;Admissions &lt;/i&gt;an even more introspective memoir than his first, if such a thing is possible.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Consistently entertaining...Honesty is abundantly apparent here--a quality as rare and commendable in elite surgeons as one suspects it is in memoirists.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Disarmingly frank storytelling...his reflections on death and dying equal those in Atul Gawande&#39;s excellent &lt;i&gt;Being Mortal&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;--&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry Marsh has spent a lifetime operating on the surgical frontline. There have been exhilarating highs and devastating lows, but his love for the practice of neurosurgery has never wavered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the publication of his celebrated &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller &lt;i&gt;Do No Harm&lt;/i&gt;, Marsh retired from his full-time job in England to work pro bono in Ukraine and Nepal. In &lt;i&gt;Admissions&lt;/i&gt; he describes the difficulties of working in these troubled, impoverished countries and the further insights it has given him into the practice of medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marsh also faces up to the burden of responsibility that can come with trying to reduce human suffering. Unearthing memories of his early days as a medical student, and the experiences that shaped him as a young surgeon, he explores the difficulties of a profession that deals in probabilities rather than certainties, and where the overwhelming urge to prolong life can come at a tragic cost for patients and those who love them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on what forty years of handling the human brain has taught him, Marsh finds a different purpose in life as he approaches the end of his professional career and a fresh understanding of what matters to us all in the end.&lt;/p&gt;" />
