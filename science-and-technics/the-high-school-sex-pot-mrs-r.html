&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt&quot;&gt;Did you ever wonder what your teens wanted to know about sex (without asking)? Do you need a book to jump-start your discussion of sex with your teen? Mrs. R. has been able to generate discussion in her classroom by having her students anonymously submit questions each class period that she would answer. The questions that the students submitted were blunt and honest. She attempted to answer all questions submitted, and tied the answers to the physiology of human sexuality and the maturity needed for responsible decision-making. The frank and innocent questions are contained in the book, and her candid, informative and sometimes humorous answers are captured in the pages.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Mrs. R. has compiled sex-related questions that she has anonymously received from teens over the past several years and has answered them scientifically, humorously, and with a frankness that puts adults and teens at ease about todays sexual issues. This book is a must-read for teens, parents, and educators. Everyone is bound to learn something and may come away inspired to more frankly discuss sexuality with those closest to them.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
