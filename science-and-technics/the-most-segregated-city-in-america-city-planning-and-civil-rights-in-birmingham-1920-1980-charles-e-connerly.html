  <title>The Most Segregated City in America&quot;: City Planning and Civil Rights in Birmingham, 1920-1980 - Charles E. Connerly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Planetizen&#39;s Top Ten Books of     2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But for Birmingham,&quot; Fred Shuttleworth recalled President John     F. Kennedy saying in June 1963 when he invited black leaders to meet with him, &quot;we would     not be here today.&quot; Birmingham is well known for its civil rights history, particularly for     the violent white-on-black bombings that occurred there in the 1960s, resulting in the     city&#39;s nickname &quot;Bombingham.&quot; What is less well known about Birmingham&#39;s     racial history, however, is the extent to which early city planning decisions influenced and     prompted the city&#39;s civil rights protests. The first book-length work to analyze this     connection, &lt;i&gt;&quot;The Most Segregated City in America&quot;: City Planning and Civil Rights in     Birmingham, 1920-1980&lt;/i&gt; uncovers the impact of Birmingham&#39;s urban planning     decisions on its black communities and reveals how these decisions led directly to the civil     rights movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spanning over sixty years, Charles E. Connerly&#39;s study     begins in the 1920s, when Birmingham used urban planning as an excuse to implement racial zoning     laws, pointedly sidestepping the 1917 U.S. Supreme Court Buchanan v. Warley decision that had     struck down racial zoning. The result of this obstruction was the South&#39;s longest-standing     racial zoning law, which lasted from 1926 to 1951, when it was redeclared unconstitutional by     the U.S. Supreme Court. Despite the fact that African Americans constituted at least 38 percent     of Birmingham&#39;s residents, they faced drastic limitations to their freedom to choose where     to live. When in the1940s they rebelled by attempting to purchase homes in off-limit areas,     their efforts were labeled as a challenge to city planning, resulting in government and court     interventions that became violent. More than fifty bombings ensued between 1947 and 1966,     becoming nationally publicized only in 1963, when four black girls were killed in the bombing of     the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connerly effectively uses     Birmingham&#39;s history as an example to argue the importance of recognizing the link that     exists between city planning and civil rights. His demonstration of how Birmingham&#39;s     race-based planning legacy led to the confrontations that culminated in the city&#39;s     struggle for civil rights provides a fresh lens on the history and future of urban planning, and     its relation to race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
