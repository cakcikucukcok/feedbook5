  <title>The Effects of Khat (Catha Edulis) - Yousif Al Zarouni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Catha Edulis is a psychoactive plant found in East Africa and Western Arabia. Depending on who you ask, Khat may be considered a deadly drug or a cultural tradition. This book goes into detail on the psychoactive effects whether Instantaneous, Long Term Usage, or Indeterminate. As children we were always taught to never use drugs simply because they are &#39;bad&#39;. Opinions differ in today&#39;s world, people don&#39;t want to hear whats healthy and what isn&#39;t, they need reason. By reading the effects and the risks of having that effect you will be able to judge for yourself what is good and what is bad. Catha Edulis has been the helper of one and the destroyer of another as they claim. When it comes to debates involving Khat it never ends. It was banned in the U.K on June 24th 2014, however if synthetic drugs are available and are labelled as not for human consumption, is it fair to say that these hard research drugs should be banned as well since they employ much worse effects as well as risks?" />
