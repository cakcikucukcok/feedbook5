  <title>Code of Practice for Project Management for Construction and Development - CIOB (The Chartered Institute of Building)</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The first edition of the &lt;i&gt;Code of Practice for Project Management for Construction and Development&lt;/i&gt;, published in 1992, was groundbreaking in many ways. Now in its fifth edition, prepared by a multi-institute task force coordinated by the CIOB and including representatives from RICS, RIBA, ICE, APM and CIC, it continues to be the authoritative guide and reference to the principles and practice of project management in construction and development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good project management in construction relies on balancing the key constraints of time, quality and cost in the context of building functionality and the requirements for sustainability within the built environment. Thoroughly updated and restructured to reflect the challenges that the industry faces today, this edition continues to drive forward the practice of construction project management. The principles of strategic planning, detailed programming and monitoring, resource allocation and effective risk management, widely used on projects of all sizes and complexity, are all fully covered. The integration of Building Information Modelling at each stage of the project life is a feature of this edition. In addition, the impact of trends and developments such as the internationalisation of construction projects and the drive for sustainability are discussed in context.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Code of Practice&lt;/i&gt; will be of particular value to clients, project management professionals and students of construction, as well as to the wider construction and development industries. Much of the information will also be relevant to project management professionals operating in other commercial spheres.&lt;/p&gt;" />
