  <title>The Emerging New Science - Noel Huntley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is not unusual today to hear references to the New Science.  Scientists in many disciplines recognise the need for a new paradigm; a science encompassing all facets of knowledge: current mainstream science, metaphysics, the paranormal, religions, philosophy, New Age, ancient knowledge.  The Emerging New Science presents the big picture and can accommodate all fields of knowledge, embracing life, mind, the universe and consciousness, well beyond the narrow field of current science, which only handles the surface of the universe, and in fact is essentially limited to non-harmonic laws and principles, with subsequent non-harmonic technologies, resulting in pollution, harmful energies to life, extreme inefficiencies of energy generation, and deficiencies in energy supplies.
The multiverse is a holographic fractal system of ordered dimensional levels for the evolution of consciousness.  There is no dualism, infinite regression, once the subjectivity/objectivity illusion is understood.  
The purposes of life and the universe are known today, though not realised 
by the general public and the scientific community.  However, one must firstly know what life itself is.  Is it merely matter, mechanisms or is there something else? 
Science, in pushing its boundaries into more advanced regions of knowledge, such as, in particular, the origin of life and the universe, without a shift or expansion of its existing paradigm, must either utterly admit failure, or arrogantly grossly alter truth by forcing the miracles of creation to fit into its hugely limited framework. 	Leading visionary physicist Richard Feynman states it succinctly: What we need is imaginationwe have to find a new view of the world." />
