  <title>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism - Shoshana Zuboff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenges to humanity posed by the digital future, the first detailed examination of the unprecedented form of power called &quot;surveillance capitalism,&quot; and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control our behavior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this masterwork of original thinking and research, Shoshana Zuboff provides startling insights into the phenomenon that she has named surveillance capitalism. The stakes could not be higher: a global architecture of behavior modification threatens human nature in the twenty-first century just as industrial capitalism disfigured the natural world in the twentieth.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Zuboff vividly brings to life the consequences as surveillance capitalism advances from Silicon Valley into every economic sector. Vast wealth and power are accumulated in ominous new &quot;behavioral futures markets,&quot; where predictions about our behavior are bought and sold, and the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new &quot;means of behavioral modification.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The threat has shifted from a totalitarian Big Brother state to a ubiquitous digital architecture: a &quot;Big Other&quot; operating in the interests of surveillance capital. Here is the crucible of an unprecedented form of power marked by extreme concentrations of knowledge and free from democratic oversight. Zuboff&#39;s comprehensive and moving analysis lays bare the threats to twenty-first century society: a controlled &quot;hive&quot; of total connection that seduces with promises of total certainty for maximum profit--at the expense of democracy, freedom, and our human future.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With little resistance from law or society, surveillance capitalism is on the verge of dominating the social order and shaping the digital future--if we let it.&lt;/div&gt;" />
