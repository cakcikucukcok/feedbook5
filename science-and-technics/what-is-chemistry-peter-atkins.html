  <title>What is Chemistry? - Peter Atkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most people remember chemistry from their schooldays as a subject that was largely incomprehensible, fact-rich but understanding-poor, smelly, and so far removed from the real world of events and pleasures that there seemed little point, except for the most introverted,  in coming to terms with its grubby concepts, spells, recipes, and rules. 
Peter Atkins wants to change all that. In What is Chemistry? he encourages us to look at chemistry anew, through a chemist&#39;s eyes, to understand its central concepts and to see how it contributes not only towards our material comfort, but also to human culture. Atkins shows how chemistry provides the infrastructure of our world, through the chemical industry, the fuels of heating, power generation, and transport, as well as the fabrics of our clothing and furnishings. 
By considering the remarkable achievements that chemistry has made, and examining its place between both physics and biology, Atkins presents a fascinating, clear, and rigorous exploration of the world of chemistry - its structure, core concepts, and exciting contributions to new cutting-edge technologies." />
