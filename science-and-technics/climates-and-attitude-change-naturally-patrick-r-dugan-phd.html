  <title>Climates and Attitude Change ---- Naturally! - Patrick R. Dugan PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Evidence and observations are presented, demonstrating that the primary cause of the earth warming trend is a collective result due to very large sources of: heat, moisture, CO2, smoke and other substances that absorb solar radiation. Examples are: lightning, nuclear reactions, volcano eruptions, wildfires, human and animal metabolism and probably others that have not been identified herein. All the above contributors are natural sources. 
The case is presented whereby a significant amount of human and animal activity are coincident with life processes and are therefore not controllable; whereas some activities are a matter of choice and are controllable. 
Earth is presently in a period of increased heat released from volcanic activity and from human and animal population growth. Although no quantitative evidence is presented, there is the possibility that heat from lightning and deep ocean thermal vents may also be increasing. 
This leads to the conclusion that the relatively low concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is a minor source of global or regional warming and/or climate change. It also implies that decrease of CO2 in the atmosphere will not significantly ameliorate or control climate changea specious speculation based upon a fallacious postulation. 
Further, the cases presented lead to an explanation of the frequently observed lack of correlation between atmospheric CO2 concentration and global temperature change. 
Finally, it is also concluded that CO2 is ubiquitous, pervasive and essential to all living organisms. It is neither an environmental pollutant nor a hazardous chemical under normal environmental circumstances." />
