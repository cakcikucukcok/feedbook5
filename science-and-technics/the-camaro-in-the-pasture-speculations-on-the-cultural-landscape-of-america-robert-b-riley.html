  <title>The Camaro in the Pasture: Speculations on the Cultural Landscape of America - Robert B. Riley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Robert Riley has been a renowned figure in landscape studies for over fifty years,     valued for his perceptive, learned, and highly entertaining articles, reviews, and essays. Much     of Riley&#39;s work originally ran in &lt;i&gt;Landscape,&lt;/i&gt; the pioneering magazine at     which Riley succeeded the great geographer J. B. Jackson as editor. &lt;i&gt;The Camaro in the     Pasture&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to collect this compelling author&#39;s writing. With     diverse topics ranging from science-fiction fantasies to problems of academic design research,     the essays in this volume cover an entire half-century of Riley&#39;s observations on the     American landscape. The essays-several of which are new or previously unpublished-interpret     changing rationales for urban beautification, the evolution and transformation of the strip, the     development of a global landscape of golf and resorts replacing an older search for exoticism,     and the vernacular landscape as wallpaper rather than quilt. Ultimately, Riley envisions our     future landscape as a rapidly fluctuating electronic net draped over the more slowly changing     and familiar land- and building-based system. Throughout, Riley emphasizes the vernacular     landscape of contemporary America-how we have shaped and use it, what it is becoming, and, above     all, how we experience it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
