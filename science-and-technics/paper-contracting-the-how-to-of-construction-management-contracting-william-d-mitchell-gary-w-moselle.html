  <title>Paper Contracting: The How-To of Construction Management Contracting - William D Mitchell, Gary W Moselle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Risk, and the headaches that go with it, have always been a major part of any construction project - risk of loss, negative cash flow, construction claims, regulations, excessive changes, disputes, slow pay - sometimes you&#39;ll make money, and often you won&#39;t. But many contractors today are avoiding almost all of that risk by working under a construction management contract, where they are simply a paid consultant to the owner, running the job, but leaving him the risk. This manual is the how-to of construction management contracting. You&#39;ll learn how the process works, how to get started as a CM contractor, what the job entails, how to deal with the issues that come up, when to step back, and how to get the job completed on time and on budget. Includes a link to free downloads of CM contracts legal in each state. 272 pages." />
