  <title>Field Book for Quality Control in Earthwork Operations - Alberto Munguia Mireles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The material used for subgrade or embankment construction are variable in color, texture and density-moisture relationship. To adequately control the compaction and field densities of these materials is necessary to know what to expect of the material being use. This field book provides you with some information that will serve this purpose. Soil testing is a quantitative method of quality control for the compacted fill material, and the actual number and types made will depend on the requirements specified by the Designer. The Texas Department of Transportation established those requirements on a document called Schedule for Testing and Sampling. Soil testing should always be specified, conducted and the results closely monitored by the designer, inspector and contractor 
This field book is used precisely, to collect information on site to fully understand the nature of the material that is being use on the project and to demonstrate that the compacted fill is meeting with soils properties, densities-moisture relationship and number of testing required. Closely monitoring the information collected on this field book will give the user valuable information that will allow him to properly manipulate the material being processed 
This field book is a training tool that aggregates civil engineering and construction knowledge that is considered fundamental during the execution of the earthwork" />
