  <title>A Year of Star Hopping: Star Hopping location techniques for finding the most beautiful sights in the night sky, with explanations of how to find them - David M. Hearn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you enjoy exploring the Night Sky, but just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find anything interesting with your telescope? Most everyone starts out with looking at the bright planets and the Moon. These are pretty easy to point at and locate in your scope. But I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve seen gorgeous photos of deep sky objects, and wonder how you can find and view these amazing targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have a planetarium app on your phone or a paper star atlas, and you&amp;rsquo;ve been checking it out and all the neat looking deep sky objects it shows. But when you get under the stars, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to actually match up what you&amp;rsquo;re seeing in the charts with what&amp;rsquo;s up in the sky. It&amp;rsquo;s a problem; there is a pretty big learning curve for people just starting out in astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s a fairly easy solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last 40 years, I have taught myself to locate these numerous and various targets in the night sky, and to understand what I was seeing. Since that time I have shown thousands of people the night sky, showing them this basic method for locating deep sky objects with their telescopes and binoculars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can do the same for you, and it&amp;#39;s all spelled out in A Year of Star Hopping.&lt;/p&gt;" />
