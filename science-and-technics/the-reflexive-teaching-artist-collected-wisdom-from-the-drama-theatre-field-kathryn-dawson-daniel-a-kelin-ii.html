  <title>The Reflexive Teaching Artist: Collected Wisdom from the Drama/Theatre Field - Kathryn Dawson, Daniel A. Kelin, Ii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Reflexive Teaching Artist invites Teaching Artists at all levels of experience to consider the power of reflective practice. Kathryn Dawson and Daniel A. Kelin, II offer a reflective framework - a series of foundational concepts, including intentionality, quality, artistic perspective, assessment, and praxis - illuminated through reflexive case-study examples from Teaching Artists in a wide range of settings. The authors write from the dual perspectives of artist and educator to raise fundamental questions about the complex intentions, relationships and function of the teaching artist in school, community, and professional theatre settings. Through questions, guided reflection activities, collected wisdom from the field, and an introductory action-research model, Dawson, Kelin and their contributors closely examine the practice of teaching in, through, and about drama and theatre." />
