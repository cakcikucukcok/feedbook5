  <title>Pandemic - Sonia Shah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize | A &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;Editor&#39;s Choice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;[A] grounded, bracingly intelligent study&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prizewinning science journalist Sonia Shah presents a startling examination of the pandemics that have ravaged humanity--and shows us how history can prepare us to confront the most serious acute global health emergency of our time.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past fifty years, more than three hundred infectious diseases have either emerged or reemerged, appearing in places where they&#39;ve never before been seen. Years before the sudden arrival of COVID-19, ninety percent of epidemiologists predicted that one of them would cause a deadly pandemic sometime in the next two generations. It might be Ebola, avian flu, a drug-resistant superbug, or something completely new, like the novel virus the world is confronting today. While it was impossible to predict the emergence of SARS-CoV-2--and it remains impossible to predict which pathogen will cause the next global outbreak--by unraveling the stories of pandemics past we can begin to better understand our own future, and to prepare for what it holds in store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Pandemic: Tracking Contagions, from Cholera to Ebola and Beyond&lt;/i&gt;, Sonia Shah interweaves history, original reportage, and personal narrative to explore the origins of epidemics, drawing parallels between cholera--one of history&#39;s most deadly and disruptive pandemic-causing pathogens--and the new diseases that stalk humankind today. She tracks each stage of cholera&#39;s dramatic journey, from its emergence in the South Asian hinterlands as a harmless microbe to its rapid dispersal across the nineteenth-century world, all the way to its latest beachhead in Haiti. Along the way she reports on the pathogens now following in cholera&#39;s footsteps, from the MRSA bacterium that besieges her own family to the never-before-seen killers coming out of China&#39;s wet markets, the surgical wards of New Delhi, and the suburban backyards of the East Coast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delving into the convoluted science, strange politics, and checkered history of one of the world&#39;s deadliest diseases, &lt;i&gt;Pandemic&lt;/i&gt; is a work of epidemiological history like no other, with urgent lessons for our own time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Shah proves a disquieting Virgil, guiding us through the hells ruled by [infectious diseases] . . . the power of Shah&#39;s account lies in her ability to track simultaneously the multiple dimensions of the public-health crises we are facing.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The Chicago Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
