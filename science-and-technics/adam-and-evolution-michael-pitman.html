  <title>Adam and Evolution - Michael Pitman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This work is updated version of the original ground-breaking Adam and Evolution. It not only heavily criticises neo-Darwinian orthodoxy in all its various fields but also provides a logical, alternative perspective to the question of life&amp;#39;s origin. Its premise is that matter (and therefore any biological vehicle) is a form of non-conscious energy but code is an expression of thought. Matter itself, having no reason, cannot produce codified information. Does a biological body, perhaps even the body of the universe itself, involve an immaterial part -&amp;nbsp;codified instruction&amp;nbsp;that makes it larger than the sum of its physical parts? Or is chance king? Although the universe appears to work by rules and to have been established in a very particular way, a materialist believes that this appearance of order is in fact unplanned. Its invisible framework of regulation must have occurred by chance and, since inception, individual objects and events&amp;nbsp;occur by chance as well.&amp;nbsp;Thus neo-Darwinism is a gospel accepted in the faith that, given enough time, chance could generate the miracle of life. Is this a rational&amp;nbsp;belief? Let us take a look at these two radical differences of opinion, ones that affect us personally and deeply. This works is a harbinger of the philosophical framework called Natural Dialectic and links with books Science and the Soul, A Mutant Ape? The Origin of Man&amp;#39;s Descent and A Potted Grammar of Natural Dialectic.&lt;/p&gt;" />
