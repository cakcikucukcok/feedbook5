  <title>International Project Management - Brian E. Porter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Considerations in international project management go beyond the project itself. They include areas such as culture, travel, resource management, and communication. Porter, with his international experience, explains in great detail the other aspects that may be overlooked by the inexperienced. His tips and examples are useful and easy to understand. The book begins with a review of project management basics, which is a nice lead in to the additional areas of discussion necessary for international project management. Valuable for anyone involved in international projects of all types.
--Scott Biba, Senior Mechanical Engineer and Project Manager, Design Concepts, Inc.
Porter was able to relate the situations in the book to real life. My work has taken me to all corners of the globe, and what is presented is very accurate. International project management takes a lot of time and dedication. It can be very difficult to cross the international boundaries with respect to culture and work ethic. Everyone getting into project management, and many already involved, will benefit from the message in this book. In a few short hours, this book will change your outlook on how you deal with international customers and suppliers. Hours that may save your project. 
--Gregory L. Piper, Project Engineer, NASA Glenn Research Center
Porter&#39;s International Project Management is an essential read for all project managers whether your projects are local or globally based.  This book cuts to the common core of all projects, effective communication. Porter&#39;s keen sense of how to manage the subtleties of project management combined with his personal experiences make this book an enjoyable read and a great reference for how to build successful international business relationships now and in the future.
