  <title>Thoughts of a Scientist, Citizen, and Grandpa on Climate Change - Eric P. Grimsrud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Global warming has been a subject of great interest to both the scientific community and the general public during the last two decades. The consensus among scientists is that global warming is caused by mans activities. At the same time, however, the publics perceived importance of the global warming issue has not yet prompted them or their elected representatives to take an appropriate level of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Thoughts of a Scientist, Citizen, and Grandpa on Climate Change&lt;/i&gt;, author Dr. Eric P. Grimsrud discusses this disparity of thought and examines whether there are valid reasons for this gap. He provides a basic scientific understanding of the global warming issue and talks about the substantial economic and political impacts. He also presents a brief review of the most current literature providing evidence for anthropogenic global warming (AGW) and uses a question-and-answer format to dispel the arguments against global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From his vantage point of a scientist by trade, a citizen, and a grandfather, Grimsrud takes a stand on this issue that is certain to become of central importance to our descendents throughout the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
