  <title>Set Your Phaser to Stun - Steve Pearse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Summary
This book is a scientific investigation into the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis, which demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that we are being visited by extraterrestrial Beings from another World. This story involves two unrelated cases of abduction. The first case is the well known Betty and Barney Hill case that was published in The Interrupted Journey in 1961, and Captured in 2007. The second case involves a  married couple named Kay and Erik Wilson whose experiences were published in The Alien Jigsaw in 1993 and its accompanying Researchers  Supplement in 1994. Information from both of these cases have been merged together to prove that the star map that Betty Hill drew was not only real, but it was actually Earth based.
The Wilson case proved to be the key in unlocking the door. Like Betty Hill, once again, a brave soul had the courage to ask the Beings where they come from; and as a result of this unique one on one conversation between Erik Wilson and a Grey, without realizing it, he was  given major clues to find their home world. Set Your Phaser To Stun! reveals that Bettys star map is real and the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis has  been purposely skewed to deceive the public. When Carl Sagan involved himself in this dispute many years ago, he claimed Bettys star map only showed meaningless random dots, which were not specific points of reference for any known stars.  This book proves that Sagan was wrong and was involved in what some people claim  to be scientific misconduct relating to the UFO subject. The stars that Betty Hill drew of the star map she was shown in 1961 are anything but random.
Set Your Phaser To Stun! takes a fresh new look at the Betty and Barney Hill case and examines previous interpretations of the star map, with particular emphasis on Marjorie Fishs Zeta Reticuli Interpretation.  This new research, which began in the year 2000, uncovers the fact that some of our closest neighborhood stars are linked in a network of trade and exploration by a highly advanced extraterrestrial civilization that is less than 50 light years away from us. The real shock is the location of Sol, our sun, and the role humans play in the aliens agenda.
For far too long the establishment has systematically denied the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis has any substance. This opinionated stance has been based on the urgent need to control the dissemination of news that they feared would ultimately damage the fabric of our society should it be released. An extreme political drama of the highest order has been blocking disclosure.
The Military Industrial Complex has been unwilling to relinquish control to civilian authorities and there is a grave fear that disclosure will have a severe, negative impact on our Religious Institutions worldwide. They fear allowing the public access to information which would severely challenge the traditional belief that humanity is unique and has a special relationship to God. The official position on this subject is based upon the idea that society is not prepared to handle the psychological impact of the knowledge that we are not alone in the universe. They have even gone so far as resorting to scientific misconduct because they are deeply afraid of possible societal upheaval. 
Fortunately, in May of 2008, a remarkable turn of events occurred within the Catholic Church when astronomer Father Gabriel Funes wrote in the Vatican Newspaper that intelligent beings created by God could exist in outer space. He moved further toward official legitimization of the acceptance of other life by calling the aliens our Brothers and Sisters. This was the beginning of a slow and well planned acclimation process of one billion Catholics worldwide. 
It has often been stated that we would have to rewrite history if contact with an alien civilization ever took place. Set Your Phaser To Stun!- is the beginning of that process." />
