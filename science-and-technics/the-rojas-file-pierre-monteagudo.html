      <meta name="description" content="Book description:&lt;br/&gt;
Mystery and secrecy come to light after 5 decades in an exciting story which reveals the complot to hide the inventions and discoveries of Doctor Rojas, a key scientist behind the landing of mankind on the moon. In the middle of the “Cold War” and while he was working for NASA, Doctor Rojas met with a president, travelled to the former Soviet Union, took the  fateful decision to agree to  an interview in Washington D.C. and afterward, what happened? The parties involved claim not to have any knowledge of him, but the truth is that this story is based on real events. While the 50th anniversary of the first manned landing on the moon approaches, we are presented with this fascinating book, which consists of two parts For starters it’s a tribute to the posthumous memory of astrophysicist Héctor. R. Rojas, who was able to travel to the moon on secret NASA flights, and in the second part, the author presents his lifelong thoughts about the UFO phenomenon. Without a doubt it’s an exciting story, written in simple and direct language. &lt;br/&gt;" />
