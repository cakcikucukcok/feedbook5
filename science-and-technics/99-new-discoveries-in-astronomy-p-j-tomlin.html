  <title>99 New Discoveries in Astronomy - P.J.Tomlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book presents what are possibly the greatest advances in astronomy and physics for years. It quantifies the force responsible for the expansion of the universe and describes its source. It identifies the greatest destructive mechanism in the universe. 
The enigmas behind the Hubble constant were resolved and this led to all the discoveries. The mysteries behind dark matter and dark energy are solved. The cause of all solar energy, including gravitational and radiant energy is identified. Surprisingly hydrogen fusion is found to be responsible for the suns remarkable prolonged stability, but it is an impossible source of surplus energy. 
The most unexpected finding was that time has an unusual property, one that is responsible for much of the behaviour of the universe. Also uncovered was an inverse relationship between time and mass. 
Another finding was the greatest catastrophe to befall the earth with after effects that we still feel today, such as shifting plate tectonics, tsunamis and earthquakes, and why the Pacific Ocean is so deep. That catastrophe led to Snowball Earth. But it also eventually caused the oxygenation of earths atmosphere and the emergence of life. Also found were why Jupiter is so hot compared with its surroundings and what drives its equatorial storms. Another discovery was the mechanism responsible for Saturns marvellous ring system. Also identified within that ring system was the physics behind the most spectacular sight in the solar system. But there are many other discoveries, such as that the theory of the Big Bang must be wrong, the quantification of gravitational energy and so on. 
This book should do to Astronomy what Darwins book The Origin of Species did to biology." />
