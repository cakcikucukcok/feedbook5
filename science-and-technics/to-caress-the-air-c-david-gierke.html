  <title>To Caress the Air - C. David Gierke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most people accept the view that the Wright brothers &lt;em&gt;invented &lt;/em&gt;the airplane. &amp;ldquo;Not so!&amp;rdquo; according to American aviation pioneer Augustus Moore Herring. &amp;ldquo;The aeroplane has a good many daddies.&amp;rdquo; Herring should know; he was there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Caress the Air&lt;/em&gt; is a biographical novel based on Herring&amp;rsquo;s 22-year career in aeronautics. The story takes place in the United States during the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries and chronicles Herring&amp;rsquo;s aeronautical achievements, his ordeals, and his triumph over severe adversity. Seldom acknowledged by historians or authors, Herring was nevertheless portrayed by his cutthroat contemporaries as an &amp;ldquo;aeronautical hyena&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; a surly character who prowled the boundaries of the flying-machine community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Influenced by the Gilded Age&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;idea that a young man could attain a life of accomplishment and honor through hard work, determination, and courage, Herring soon learned that Horatio Alger&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;rags to riches&amp;rdquo; narrative paled in the face of unrelenting rejection. Alger had also suggested that an &lt;em&gt;older, kindly, and prosperous benefactor&lt;/em&gt; might be useful in assisting a young man&amp;rsquo;s success. In 1893, at the age of 26, Herring met that person: someone who eventually proved to be his greatest antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;To Caress the Air&lt;/em&gt; makes use of recently unearthed historical documents and never-before-seen information provided by Herring&amp;rsquo;s heirs. The book&amp;rsquo;s setting is the New York State Supreme Court, Monroe County Courthouse, in Rochester.&amp;nbsp; Herring&amp;rsquo;s story is told through his testimony during the 1921 civil trial, &lt;em&gt;Herring-Curtiss Company v. Glenn H. Curtiss, et al.&lt;/em&gt;, which provides the platform for flashback scenes that document his dealings with many of the era&amp;rsquo;s aeronautical giants, including Lilienthal, Chanute, Langley, and Curtiss. The novel is rich with accurate technical and biographical details and is accompanied by pertinent footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
