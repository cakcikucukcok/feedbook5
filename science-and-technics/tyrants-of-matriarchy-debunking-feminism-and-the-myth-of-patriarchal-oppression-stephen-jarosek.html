  <title>Tyrants of Matriarchy: Debunking Feminism and the Myth of Patriarchal Oppression - Stephen Jarosek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The edifice of feminist theory stands on the myth of patriarchal oppression. In dispensing with this myth, Stephen Jarosek shows that feminism is a bankrupt ideology that cannot be substantiated. He applies principles from semiotics and systems theory, in the context of recent developments in the cognitive sciences, to show that women never were the helpless victims that feminists portray them as, to be moulded like putty in the hands of an all-controlling and unaccountable patriarchy. In the context of an emerging scientific paradigm, the author demonstrates that feminist narratives are not impartial descriptions of reality as it is but solipsistic projections of reality as feminists rationalize it. Their projections reveal more about feminists and their motivations than about the true nature of reality. Stephen Jarosek&#39;s compelling synthesis suggests that The Matriarchy is The Patriarchy&#39;s equal in all that is good and bad in culture, and this can only empower women in ways that feminism never could." />
