  <title>The Technological Elixir - Ryan D Gable</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Technological Elixir takes the reader on a journey through philosophy and technology in an effort to attain that coveted medicine of the alchemists by the way of objectivity and reason. As the subtitle &amp;ldquo;Invoking Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Understanding the Arcanum of Mysticism&amp;rdquo; suggests, you will be taken through a world of balance in addressing the moral maturity of mankind in creating technologies such as AI or those that may indefinitely sustain life. But to sustain material life in the inferior sphere is to prolong spiritual death in the superior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allegories and myths relating to immortality are addressed with a non-polarizing argument intended to bring balance back to those understandings meant for the profane and those for initiates of the great arcanum. Just as with any information, technology is a a neutral tool and this book examines the benefits and consequences of its application through logic and reason as opposed to ego, arrogance, ignorance, superstition and fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan uses theology, science and philosophy to explore the technological advancements leading to augment, virtual reality and artificial intelligences. Through the use of philosophical, objective analysis, while exploring the benefits of technology, Ryan explores the rapid advancement towards transhumanism and the singularity. With our technological Tower of Babel we are attempting to not only reach the heavens, but also conquer them when we arrive. The arrogance and ignorance of unbalanced ego and progression has allowed for our consciousness to be devoured by the beast of material desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will happen to the human spirit/soul if our memories are uploaded into computers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is our reality a computer simulation? Is the Internet already a conscious AI?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a black goo substance that is able to reprogram matter and if so what is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is the Rain Man?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our quest to conquer material and become immortal will we ourselves be devoured and trapped by material essence never to experience true immortality of the divine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we lack purpose in life and squander our opportunities for artificial pleasures or conveniences what is the purpose of extending a physically destitute existence?&lt;/p&gt;" />
