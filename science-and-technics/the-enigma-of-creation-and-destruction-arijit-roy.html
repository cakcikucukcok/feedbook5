  <title>The Enigma of Creation and Destruction - Arijit Roy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book contains some questions that arise in our mind quite frequently. The questions are as follows:
1.	Why is everything in this universe changing?
2.	What is the reason behind creation and destruction?
3.	What is the reason behind birth and death?
4.	Where have we come from?
5.	What is our destination?
6.	Is there any God? If so, where is He and what does He look like?
7.	Can God do everything that He wants to? Can He make so big a stone that He cannot lift? 
8.	 Is creation and destruction a resultant of time or nature?
An attempt has been made to answer these questions in this book. Since people are interested in the scientific view
 for answer to any type of question, an effort has been made to answer these questions from a scientific angle." />
