  <title>Purpose and Desire - J. Scott Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A professor, biologist, and physiologist argues that modern Darwinism&amp;#8217;s materialist and mechanistic biases have led to a scientific dead end, unable to define what life is&amp;#8212;and only an openness to the qualities of &quot;purpose and desire&quot; will move the field forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Turner contends. &quot;To be scientists, we force ourselves into a Hobson&amp;#8217;s choice on the matter: accept intentionality and purposefulness as real attributes of life, which disqualifies you as a scientist; or become a scientist and dismiss life&amp;#8217;s distinctive quality from your thinking. I have come to believe that this choice actually stands in the way of our having a fully coherent theory of life.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing research shows that&amp;#160;life&#39;s most distinctive quality, shared by all living things, is&amp;#160;purpose and desire: maintain homeostasis to sustain life. In &lt;em&gt;Purpose and Desire,&lt;/em&gt; Turner draws on the work of Claude Bernard, a contemporary of Darwin revered among physiologists as the founder of experimental medicine, to build on Bernard&amp;#8217;s &quot;dangerous idea&quot; of vitalism, which seeks to identify what makes &quot;life&quot; a unique phenomenon of nature. To further its quest to achieve a fuller understanding of life, Turner argues, science must move beyond strictly accepted measures that consider only the mechanics of nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thoughtful appeal to widen our perspective of biology that is grounded in scientific evidence, &lt;em&gt;Purpose and Desire&lt;/em&gt; helps us bridge the ideological evolutionary divide.&lt;/p&gt;" />
