Totally frustrated by polynomials, parabolas and that dreaded little x? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE MATH DUDE IS HERE TO HELP!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Marshall, popular podcast host known to his fans as The Math Dude, understands that algebra can cause agony. But he&#39;s determined to show you that you can solve those confusing, scream-inducing math problems--and it won&#39;t be as hard as you think! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason kicks things off with a basic-training boot camp to help you review the essential math you&#39;ll need to truly &quot;get&quot; algebra.

You&#39;ll get step-by-step instructions and tutorials to help you finally understand the problems that stump you the most, including loads of tips on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Working with fractions, decimals, exponents, radicals, functions, polynomials and more &lt;br&gt;- Solving all kinds of equations, from basic linear problems to the quadratic formula and beyond&lt;br&gt;- Using graphs and understanding why they make solving complex algebra problems easier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learning algebra doesn&#39;t have to be a form of torture, and with The &lt;i&gt;Math Dude&#39;s Quick and Dirty Guide to Algebra&lt;/i&gt;, it won&#39;t be. Packed with tons of fun features including &quot;secret agent math-libs,&quot; and &quot;math brain games,&quot; and full of quick and dirty tips that get right to the point, this book will have even the biggest math-o-phobes basking in a-ha moments and truly understanding algebra in a way that will stick for years (and tests) to come. Whether you&#39;re a student who needs help passing algebra class, a parent who wants to help their child meet that goal, or somebody who wants to brush up on their algebra skills for a new job or maybe even just for fun, look no further. Sit back, relax, and let this guide take you on a trip through the world of algebra.&lt;/p&gt;" />
