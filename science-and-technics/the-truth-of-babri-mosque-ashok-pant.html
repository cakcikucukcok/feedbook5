  <title>The Truth of Babri Mosque - Ashok Pant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The word Babri was literally used to define something abnormal, out of sense or mad. Three instances mentioned in Babar-Nama support this. Babars journal is replete with precise detail with a telling image or idiom as a bud resembling a sheeps heart, fell like water on fire which lingers in the readers mind long after the event or anecdote has receded. Few of the phrases and words in the Babar Nama are now part of everyday language in India and Pakistan as Namak Haram means lack of trustworthiness, hamesha means always, bakhshish means gift, maidan means plain area, julab means laxative and the most important, which is of our use here, is Babri/Baburi /Bavala means related to unhealthy mental state or mad or abandoned or one who is abnormal. Babar writes about his infatuation, after his marriage in March AD 1500, for a boy as, In those days I discovered myself a strange inclination - no, a mad infatuation-for a boy in the camps bazaar, his name was Babri/Baburi being apposite. Until then I had no inclination of love and  a couplet of Muhammad Salih came to my mind:&lt;/P&gt;
When I see my friend I am abashed with shame;&lt;/br&gt;
My companions look at me, I look away sans aim.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This couplet suited my state of mind perfectly. In that maelstrom of desire and passion, and under the stress of youthful folly, I used to wander, bareheaded and barefoot, through streets and lanes, orchards and vineyards. I showed civility neither to friends nor to strangers, took no care of myself or others. Babar clearly stated that guys name was Bavara as he was of raging and flickering nature and Babar himself became Bavara or crazy for him to attain his sexual proximity.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;That is why the term Babri Mosque is specially used only for the construction that was done according to Mughal architecture at Ramjanmabhoomi because it was made for Hindus not for Muslims. Babri Mosque means Mosques of infidels-insane Hindus.&lt;/P&gt;" />
