  <title>Uncorked: The Science of Champagne - Gérard Liger-Belair, Hervé This</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;             &lt;i&gt;Uncorked&lt;/i&gt; quenches our curiosity about the inner workings of one of the world&#39;s most prized beverages. Esteemed for its freshness, vitality, and sensuality, champagne is a wine of great complexity. Mysteries aplenty gush forth with the popping of that cork. Just what is that fizz? Can you judge champagne quality by how big the bubbles are, how long they last, or how they behave before they fade? And why does serving champagne in a long-stemmed flute prolong its chill and effervescence? Through lively prose and a wealth of state-of-the-art photos, this revised edition of &lt;i&gt;Uncorked&lt;/i&gt; unlocks the door to what champagne is all about.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt; Providing an unprecedented close-up view of the beauty in the bubbles, G&amp;#233;rard Liger-Belair presents images that look surprisingly like lovely flowers, geometric patterns, even galaxies as the bubbles rise through the glass and burst forth on the surface. He illustrates how bubbles form not on the glass itself but are &quot;born&quot; out of debris stuck on the glass wall, how they rise, and how they pop. Offering a colorful history of champagne, Liger-Belair tells us how it is made and he asks if global warming could spell champagne&#39;s demise. In a brand-new afterword, he updates the reader on new developments in the world of bubble science and delves even more deeply into the processes that give champagne its unique and beautiful character.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt; Bubbly may tickle the nose, but &lt;i&gt;Uncorked&lt;/i&gt; tackles what the nose and the naked eye cannot--the spectacular science that gives champagne its charm and champagne drinkers immeasurable pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
