  <title>Home of the Angels - Henry Kroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt&quot;&gt;This book started when I received a copy of NASA&#39;&#39;s video of the long wire tether experiment. NASA astronauts filmed the experiment from the space shuttle &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt&quot;&gt;Columbia&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt&quot;&gt; with a hand-held video camera that contained a wide spectrum chip enabling the camera to pick up high ultraviolet images that ordinarily would be invisible to the human eye. The long wire tether satellite contained a reel with a 12-mile-lorig cable and instruments to measure voltage in the upper atmosphere. The satellite measured a voltage ranging from 12 to 14 million volts.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt&quot;&gt;While the astronauts were filming the experiment from a distance of fifty miles a sudden surge of over three million volts burnt the cable in half. After NASA retrieved the satellite switches were thrown and a CO2 tank valve had been opened.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt&quot;&gt;After reviewing the tape for some time I realized that the camera was picking up round three-mile-diameter ships from a higher energy-state or dimension. (I hate to use the word dimension because people roll their eyes.) The huge dimensional ships seemed to be curious about the experiment and were swarming around the tether satellite like large jellyfish. They would lower their energy state and suddenly become visible to the wide-spectrum camera and glide slowly around the cable.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;A name=OLE_LINK1&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt&quot;&gt;It became obvious to me that I was observing spaceships created by intelligent beings with the capability of living in space forever. They had obviously worked out their political differences long ago and exist in a sort of mind-control society. They need us for emotional entertainment and coexist with us here on earth. Mind control societies feed on other people&#39;&#39;s emotion because it is forbidden to them. The book is about the history of encounters with angels and the mindset needed to develop the technology to live in space.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
