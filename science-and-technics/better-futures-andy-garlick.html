  <title>Better Futures - Andy Garlick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Better Futures&lt;/em&gt; is not just a textbook on risk management.&amp;nbsp; It provides new perspectives to help you embed risk management into your organisation in a more natural way; the aim is to ensure you maximise your opportunity to enjoy &amp;lsquo;better futures&amp;rsquo; rather than worse ones, taking account of the many aspects of uncertainty you and your organisation face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is based on the author&amp;rsquo;s experience of working in risk over 35 years where he saw many examples of dysfunctional &amp;lsquo;common practice&amp;rsquo; risk management.&amp;nbsp; He deconstructs every aspect of this practice and rebuilds it into a structure which is more logical and better adapted to embedding in organisations.&amp;nbsp; The work is based on a number of simple principles.&amp;nbsp; For example, there are no risk management processes, just processes which recognise the inevitable risk and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed model has three layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The natural risk management layer builds on what managers have been doing naturally for millennia, augmented by modern and customised approaches to risk analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The management layer contains the additional activities which are necessary to make this work within the modern organisation, alongside budgeting and other control activities, and providing stakeholders with information.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The governance layer provides the organisation with the means to manage risk consistently and visibly across many spans of control, including external stakeholders, clients, suppliers and contractors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there are no dedicated risk processes, the material is presented as a number of tools which the risk manager can adopt in a way which best fits their organisation and its environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of natural risk management is building the appropriate risk culture.&amp;nbsp; This is a subject which has been recognised only relatively recently and a major chapter is devoted to explaining what is known about this topic: how it can be measured and how it can be improved both to match the culture of the organisation and to deal more effectively with risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk management is most of all about making decisions in the face of risk and uncertainty.&amp;nbsp; This is a neglected topic in most risk management thinking which leads to some very inappropriate recipes.&amp;nbsp; Because of this, &lt;em&gt;Better Futures&lt;/em&gt; also contains a detailed chapter on the theory of decision making which covers the spectrum from classical economics thinking through the psychological research and work on the nature of rationality.&amp;nbsp; This is essential material for all risk managers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
