  <title>The Pope of Physics - Gino Segre, Bettina Hoerlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Enrico Fermi is unquestionably among the greats of the world&#39;s physicists, the most famous Italian scientist since Galileo. Called the Pope by his peers, he was regarded as infallible in his instincts and research. His discoveries changed our world; they led to weapons of mass destruction and conversely to life-saving medical interventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unassuming man struggled with issues relevant today, such as the threat of nuclear annihilation and the relationship of science to politics. Fleeing Fascism and anti-Semitism, Fermi became a leading figure in America&#39;s most secret project: building the atomic bomb. The last physicist who mastered all branches of the discipline, Fermi was a rare mixture of theorist and experimentalist. His rich legacy encompasses key advances in fields as diverse as comic rays, nuclear technology, and early computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their revealing book, &lt;i&gt;The Pope of Physics&lt;/i&gt;, Gino Segré and Bettina Hoerlin bring this scientific visionary to life. An examination of the human dramas that touched Fermi&#39;s life as well as a thrilling history of scientific innovation in the twentieth century, this is the comprehensive biography that Fermi deserves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
