1. Where did we come from?
2. What is gravity?
3. What is matter?
4. What is dark matter?
5. What is dark energy?
6. What is aether?
7. What is light?
After reading his book and finding out the true secrets of the universe, many are forced to wonder if this is, indeed, the greatest discovery of our time.
It is a fact that sound waves (mechanical waves) require a material or medium for its propagation such as gas, solids, and liquids. The theory is that all waves need a medium to propagate through empty space, as does electromagnetic waves.
As far back as 1678, scientists like Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, Nikola Tesla, and the scientific community all believed that light needed a medium to propagate through empty space.
Since Einsteins special relativity theory in 1905, the modern scientific community recognizes the vacuum for the propagation of light through empty space, and not aether.
Randy Lee Holmes has discovered visual proof and illustrations by more than two hundred photos and forty-six videos of the aether of nature and the universe. All photos and videos show the electromagnetic radiation blueprint of the aether that serves as a medium for all light and electromagnetic waves in nature, the universe, and beyond.
The book is guaranteed to answer the seven questions that everyone wants to know. You will not only understand what you read, but you will see the world and the universe come together as one big puzzle.
After reading the historical and nonfiction book Aether-Light, you will learn that all living and nonliving things are connected and made of light. Yes, people are made of light.
In the beginning, God said, Let there be light." />
