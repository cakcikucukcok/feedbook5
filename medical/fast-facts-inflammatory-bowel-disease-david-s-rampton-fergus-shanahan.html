  <title>Fast Facts: Inflammatory Bowel Disease - David S Rampton, Fergus Shanahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#39;s disease, referred to collectively as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic debilitating disorders. IBD, particularly Crohn’s disease, is increasing everywhere, most notably in the Western world where about 1 in 200 people now has the condition. This highly readable, ‘zippy’ fourth edition of Fast Facts: Inflammatory Bowel Disease provides succinct yet thorough information that will aid early recognition of these disorders and their complications, alongside practical holistic management advice. 
So what’s new in this edition?
• Increased insight into the causes of IBD
• New chapters on extraintestinal manifestations and management principles
• Key information on the limitations and side effects of traditional treatment options
• New and emerging drugs that target specific inflammatory pathways
• An overview of specific management issues in elderly patients
With important emphasis on the doctor–patient relationship and effective multidisciplinary services, Fast Facts: Inflammatory Bowel Disease is an invaluable resource for all primary care providers, hospital doctors in training, nurses, stoma therapists, dieticians, psychologists, counselors and social workers; in fact, all health professionals involved in the care of patients with IBD, as well as patients who wish to know more about their condition." />
