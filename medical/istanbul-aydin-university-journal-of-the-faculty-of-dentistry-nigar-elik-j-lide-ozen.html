In the light of these recent developments, our journal will create an opportunity to the academicians, either from Turkey or abroad, to share their studies and outcome of researches about the dentistry. Our goal is to reach the highest scientific level by achieving wide-ranging participation as soon as possible which will enable our journal to be listed among international indices journals and also contribute to the recognition of the Istanbul Aydin University worldwide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We aim to publish the articles of various guest authors, compilations, peculiar researches and case reports which will lead us to highest scientific levels through a widespread participation in our future issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I appreciate the contributions of our valuable teachers who strived vigorously for the publication of high level scientific quality Journal of Aydin Dental by being part of the scientific committee during the publication period through their immense knowledge and experience. Also, special thanks to our honorable teacher Prof. Dr. Ahmet Metin Ger and his team members including whole academician colleagues who contributed to the journal. I wish a successful, long lasting publication lifespan to our journal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
