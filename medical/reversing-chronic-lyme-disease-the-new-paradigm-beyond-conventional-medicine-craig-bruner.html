  <title>Reversing Chronic Lyme Disease:  the New Paradigm Beyond Conventional Medicine - Craig Bruner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his book, Reversing Chronic Lyme Disease, Craig Bruner has written perhaps one of the most in-depth, intelligent, and comprehensive books ever written on the subject of chronic Lyme disease. Extremely powerful, yet practical. It addresses nearly every important level of the Lyme narrative. A no-holds barred and honest look at how the government and conventional medicine have not only failed the Lyme victim, but by using their drug-based model have actually prolonged the disease in the vast majority of chronic sufferers. The author lays out a new paradigm that he used himself to reverse and completely heal his long-entrenched chronic Lyme disease, almost exclusively without the use of drugs. This book puts the power of healing squarely back in the hands of the Lyme victim, and provides an intelligent road map that can be custom designed to help reverse Lyme disease even in the most resistant of sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a monumental work and represents the culmination of over 6 years of research. Seldom has the subject of Lyme disease been studied, written about, and presented on such a level. It will open your eyes with an in-depth look at not just Lyme disease, but the chronic form which other authors seldom even discuss, let alone present why it happens. Additionally, Craig Bruner shares therapies based upon the findings of research primarily targeted towards reversing chronic Lyme disease, many of which have never been presented in any other book. Certainly most doctors are not even aware of this information. This book may make most others obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get ready to be overwhelmed by the thorough manner in which the topic of chronic Lyme disease has been explored, and many of the newer strategies that can be employed which have brought healing beyond expectation. Be warned, this is powerful information that can offer the sufferer new hope that he/she can experience a deeper level of healing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
