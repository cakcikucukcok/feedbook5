  <title>Call Me Sister - Jane Yeadon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who&#39;d have thought a missing bacon rasher and a teaspoon would play a part in advancing someone&#39;s career? It&#39;s the late &#39;60s and Jane Yeadon has always wanted to be a district nurse. Staff nursing in a ward where she&#39;s challenged by an inventorydriven ward sister, she reckons it&#39;s time to swap such trivialities for life as a district nurse. Independent thinking is one thing, but Jane&#39;s about to find that the drama on district can demand instant reaction; and without hospital back up, she&#39;s usually the one having to provide it. She meets a rich cast of patients all determined to follow their own individual star, and goes to Edinburgh where Queen Victoria&#39;s Jubilee Institute&#39;s nurse training is considered the crème de la crème of the district nursing world. Call Me Sister recalls Jane&#39;s challenging and often hilarious route to realising her own particular dream." />
