  <title>Office-Based Buprenorphine Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder - John A. Renner, Jr., Petros Levounis, Anna T. LaRose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;With a new foreword by Nora Volkow, Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, this second edition of Office-Based Buprenorphine Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder provides updated information on evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) -- an increasingly important topic as the epidemic of opioid misuse and overdose deaths grows in the United States.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Bulleted clinical pearls at the end of each chapter, as well as specific clinical recommendations and detailed case discussions throughout, make it easier for readers to retain knowledge and integrate it into their clinical practice. The guide also features sample documentation and scales, including a treatment contract and a patient consent, that can be used to model documents in practice.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This new edition of Office-Based Buprenorphine Treatment has been updated to reflect DSM-5 language, and two additional chapters have been included: one that addresses other pharmacotherapies useful in treating OUD, including methadone and naltrexone, and another that discusses OUD treatment specifically with regard to women&#39;s health and pregnancy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Among the numerous other revisions included in the second edition are the following:  ? Information about new formulations of buprenorphine? A discussion of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA)? Changes to induction and maintenance target doses and recommendations for home inductions? Information on diversion control plans? Advice for working with Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous? A discussion on integrating buprenorphine into residential and inpatient opioid treatment programs &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Written in a jargon-free style that does not require expertise in substance use disorder treatment, Office-Based Buprenorphine Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder is an accessible, indispensable reference for primary care physicians, psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, residents, medical students, and anyone with an interest in learning about and prescribing buprenorphine.&lt;/P&gt;" />
