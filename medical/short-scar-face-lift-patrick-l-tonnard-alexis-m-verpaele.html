  <title>Short-Scar Face Lift - Patrick L. Tonnard, Alexis M. Verpaele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the highly popular &lt;cite&gt;MACS-Lift Short-Scar Rhytidectomy&lt;/cite&gt;, Drs. Patrick Tonnard and Alexis Verpaele introduced surgeons to an exciting new concept in facial rejuvenation-one that offered shorter incisions, minimal morbidity, and reduced recovery time. In this companion volume, &lt;cite&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Scar Face Lift: Operative Strategies and Techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;, Drs. Tonnard and Verpaele build on that foundation and expand their scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is organized into two sections. Part I, &lt;em&gt;Short-Scar Face-Lift Techniques&lt;/em&gt;, discusses indications, applications, and alternate short-scar face-lift techniques. The editors elaborate on the different aspects of the MACS-lift and short-scar face-lifting. They review the important lessons they have learned during years of experience with the MACS-lift, including a discussion of complications, problems, limitations, and technical tips and tricks. They are joined by Dr. Foad Nahai, who discusses technical considerations; Dr. Joseph Hunstad, who provides a systematic step-by-step guide to his approach; Dr. Mark Jewell, who describes the biomechanics of the MACS-lift and offers technical tips for success; and Dr. Daniel Baker, who describes his personal lateral SMASectomy short-scar face-lift technique and compares it to other comparable and convergent techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part II focuses on &lt;em&gt;Combined Approaches and Ancillary Treatments&lt;/em&gt; for facial rejuvenation. In this section, Dr. Daniel Labb discusses the anatomic basis of minimally invasive neck correction through a short scar and Dr. Alain Fogli details his simple, safe technique for temporal lifting. Finally, Dr. Thomas Roberts brings all of these techniques and treatments into perspective through his analysis of the volumetric concept of facial rejuvenation. He provides an in-depth discussion of facial fat micrografting and describes how the synergistic use of multiple surgical and nonsurgical modalities can lead to superior results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With beautiful, four-color illustrations, numerous case examples, and an accompanying DVD with operative videos, this book provides the ultimate surgical instruction that will allow surgeons to incorporate this procedure into their practice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
