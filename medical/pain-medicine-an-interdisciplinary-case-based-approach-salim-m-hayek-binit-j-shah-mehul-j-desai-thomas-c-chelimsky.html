  <title>Pain Medicine: An Interdisciplinary Case-Based Approach - Salim M. Hayek, Binit J. Shah, Mehul J. Desai, Thomas C. Chelimsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pain Medicine approaches the management of common chronic pain conditions using a unique interdisciplinary approach focusing on multiple facets of patients clinical presentations.  The comprehensive discussions in each chapter are centered on a vignette that mimics a fairly typical case presentation. In addition to detailed classical descriptions of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, prognosis, and confounding psychosocial factors of each disease entity, the text provides various interdisciplinary management approaches. The case-based approach illustrates key clinical points and demonstrates how practitioners from a variety of disciplines can work together to deliver optimal patient care. The ACGME criteria for fellowship training in Pain Medicine calls for an interdisciplinary approach, with required training and exposure to the fields of Anesthesiology, Neurology, Psychiatry, and Physical Medicine &amp;amp; Rehabilitation.  As this trend is occurring in private pain clinics and practices as well as in academic institutions, there is a need for a volume which integrates the approaches of the various disciplines into a coherent whole to guide clinicians and trainees in the interdisciplinary management of pain. With each chapter authored by respected experts in the key specialties involved with pain management, Pain Medicine is a highly applicable clinical reference for practitioners, an excellent anchor text for fellows and residents in training, and a thorough review for initial board certification as well as maintenance of certification exams." />
