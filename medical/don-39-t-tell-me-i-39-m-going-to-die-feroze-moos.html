  <title>Don&#39;t Tell Me I&#39;m Going to Die - Feroze Moos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These reflections on my terminal cancer have only one purpose in mind: to bring together those who would heal. and those who would be healed. 
And to preserve protect and prolong life, hold it sacred against all impediments and anyone who would have it otherwise. 
They mirror the human predicament reflected in a single heart, are written with no intent to harm,  and hold everybody harmless in an effort to save lives. 
Some of the names have been altered to protect the innocent, while others have been used with their permission. Everything written and implied explicitly. or implicitly, is solely the perception of the author. 
The story of my life struggling with the cancer in me and the cancer out there as I call it, that would have had me dead before my time, is an odyssey that allows one to look into oneself. The fragility and insouciance of human nature is terrifying, disheartening and inconceivable at times, but nonetheless allows one to transcend it if one has the courage and tenacity to survive against all odds. 
Thats what this story is all about. 
I dedicate this book to all those who would unstintingly heal, knowing what cannot be known. hold life sacred and seek this truth so as to transcend themselves and act with compassion. humility and unerring faith, to help others survive." />
