  <title>Medical Management of Type 1 Diabetes - Cecilia C. Low Wang, Avni C. Shah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Type 1 diabetes, formerly known as juvenile diabetes, is a complex disorder that requires a great deal of patient-guided self-care. In recent years, advances in diabetes treatment have dramatically shifted potential outcomes in the favor of the patient with diabetes. The challenge for health care professionals is to realize this potential through an individualized, flexible, and responsive treatment plan for patients with type 1 diabetes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now in its seventh edition, &lt;i&gt;Medical Management of Type 1 Diabetes&lt;/I&gt; offers health care providers the newest information and guidelines for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Built on the foundation of multiple daily insulin injections and insulin pump therapy, this book guides health care providers in helping their patients continually strive for optimal blood glucose control. This new edition focuses on the latest molecular advances, new treatment methods, recent clinical trials, and the American Diabetes Association&#39;s Standards of Care. Key topics also include new insulins and administration protocols, advanced carbohydrate counting, and emphasis on continuing patient education.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Individual sections address all of the topics in managing type 1 diabetes, including diagnosis and classification/pathogenesis, diabetes standards and education, tools of therapy, special situations, psychosocial factors affecting adherence, quality of life, and well-being and complications. &lt;i&gt;Medical Management of Type 1 Diabetes&lt;/I&gt; is an essential addition to any clinician&#39;s library for the treatment and understanding of type 1 diabetes.&lt;/div&gt;" />
