  <title>The Ins and Outs of Breathing - Dr. Norman L. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Breathing, one of our most essential bodily functions, is central to the proper working of the body and to your quality of life. Taking a wider view, the lungs are the only major system in direct contact with the environment, serving to protect the body with a variety of defenses, but also taking the brunt of the onslaught, when the air we breathe is toxic.
&lt;i&gt;The Ins and Outs of Breathing&lt;/i&gt; is the result of Dr. Norman Joness fifty-year odyssey to understand how the lung works and the science of breathing. Jones traces the struggles of scientists from Leonardo to the present day as they pieced together the structure of the lungs. He examines the effect of changes in breathing and its secondary effects on other body systems. Understand how breathing influences many bodily functions, from our muscles, brain, and even the immune system. 
Discover how Everest was climbed without oxygen, how Roger Bannister ran the first four-minute mile, and how SCUBA allows you to enjoy underwater exploration. Find the evidence to convince you or your friends to stop smoking. See all the different ways in which animals, marine creatures and birds breathe. Gain insights into asthma, COPD, and other lung complaints. Discover what makes your partner snore at night, and what to do about it. 
Accessible and wide-ranging, this laymans guide to the lungs can help you appreciate the many meanings of inspiration." />
