  <title>Psychiatryland - Phillip Sinaikin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever sought professional help for an emotional problem and were shocked to find yourself diagnosed as mentally ill? Are you being pressured to take psychiatric medications by a doctor who barely listens to you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you are one of the millions of consumers of professional mental healthcare in America today, the answer to both questions is most likely yesand its just as likely the treatment isnt working. In &lt;i&gt;Psychiatryland&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Phillip Sinaikin teaches you why mental healthcare in America has come to be totally dominated by the so-called medical model of mental illness and how this can be dangerous to both your mental and physical health. Geared toward consumers, Sinaikin shows that psychiatry as it is practiced today is not a progressive medical science, but rather a multibillion-dollar business, run for profit by pharmaceutical companies, the insurance industry, and mainstream psychiatry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dr. Sinaikin provides the tools to empower you and to help you learn how to take personal control of your mental healthcare and begin to make well-informed and rational decisions about the emotional well-being of yourself and the people you love." />
