      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt; 	&lt;P&gt; 		Every couple has disagreements, but what happens when recurring conflicts start to pull your relationship apart? Do you lie awake hoping that your spouse will eventually see things your way, or rehashing the evidence that you&#39;re right? Demand some immediate changes--or else?

True acceptance may seem difficult to accomplish, but the clear-cut steps and thought-provoking exercises in this book can make it a reality. You&#39;ll learn why you keep having the same fights again and again; how to keep small incompatibilities from causing big problems; what communication strategies really work to resolve conflicts; and how to problem-solve and make positive changes--together. Updated throughout with new research, practical tools, and examples, the second edition features a new chapter on mindfulness.&lt;BR&gt; 		&lt;BR&gt; 		Mental health professionals: learn about using this self-help guide as an adjunct to therapy at the authors&#39; website (http://ibct.psych.ucla.edu).&lt;BR&gt; 		 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;" />
