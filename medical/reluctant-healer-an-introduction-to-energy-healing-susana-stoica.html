  <title>Reluctant Healer: An Introduction to Energy Healing - Susana Stoica</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As stated by Dr. David Brownstein, author and pioneer in integrative medicine, &amp;quot;The Reluctant Healer is a wonderful story about a healer recognizing her powers and utilizing them to help others... The book describes twenty-first century energetic medicine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The book was originally written twenty years ago in response to the requests from doctors and their patients who wanted a book that could provide an easy-to-read fast introduction to energy medicine.&amp;nbsp; They wanted to have a better understanding of what energy healing can and cannot do, when and how to use it most effectively, and how to best integrate energy work and mainstream medicine. Compared to the first edition, the current one contains more answers to questions regarding energy healing and has an additional chapter on accessing and working with the human energy field.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Written with the focus of an engineer and researcher, the book contains a surprisingly wide array of information presented in a highly accessible way. Susana Stoica distills her over thirty years of experience, as a medically accepted healer and medical intuitive, into three areas: the full story of a healing experience, replies to frequently asked questions, and some simple exercises to access the human energy field and correct undesired energy patterns.&lt;/p&gt;" />
