  <title>Serving Faith, Profession, and Community - Prof. Faroque Ahmad Khan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1967, seven Muslim physicians arrived in the United States from various countriesIndia, Pakistan, Syria, Egypt, and Afghanistanfor advanced training. They found themselves in a new culture with few Muslims around. They formed an organization where they shared common concerns, supported each other, and maintained their identity, faith, and culture. Thus began the journey of the Islamic Medical Association (IMA).
Serving Faith, Profession, and Community, by author Faroque Ahmad Khan, captures the essence of that journey, including how this was accomplished, what some of the challenges were, and who the key individuals involved in organizing and laying the foundation of IMA (now called the Islamic Medical Association of North America (IMANA)) were. 
Describing the major contributions American Muslim physicians have made toward the health and well-being of Americans, Serving Faith, Profession, and Community chronicles the organizations first fifty years and sets goals and plans for the future." />
