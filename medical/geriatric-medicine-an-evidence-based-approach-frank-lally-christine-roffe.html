  <title>Geriatric Medicine: an evidence-based approach - Frank Lally, Christine Roffe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="People are living longer and the population over the age of 60 is burgeoning, with repercussions for health services and healthcare expenditure in developed countries. Crucially, disease aetiology, diagnosis, and treatment in older people differ from the general adult population. Older people often have complicated co-morbidities and respond to treatment in different ways compared to younger people. Evidence of efficacy of different treatments is often lackingbecause older people are under-represented in clinical trials, and the specific needs of older people are rarely discussed specifically in more general texts.  Geriatric medicine: an evidence based approach  is a clinical reference for health care professionals who manage older patients, and summarizesup-to-date research literature in a style that can be directly applied by busy healthcare professionals and provide a useful resource for reference." />
