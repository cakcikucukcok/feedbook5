  <title>Problems in Breast Surgery - Jack Fisher, Neal Handel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This truly is an outstanding text on evaluating problems in breast surgery, formulating a plan to fix them, and implementing that plan carefully and thoroughly for the desired optimal solution.&lt;/em&gt; -- &lt;strong&gt;BIZ INDIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems in Breast Surgery: A Repair Manual&lt;/strong&gt; is destined to become a valued part of every plastic surgeon and breast surgeon&#39;s library. This unique book provides a virtual lifeline for addressing the challenges encountered in aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery and avoiding possible problems and complications. This is not a traditional technique-oriented textbook; rather, it has a problem focus and provides different solutions for solving complex problems associated with secondary breast surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book begins with chapters on the basic principles of corrective breast surgery and the key anatomic factors and mechanisms of failure that are key to accurate analysis. With this foundation in place, it proceeds to address the spectrum of potential problems that can occur with each of the different procedures, ranging from breast augmentation, reduction, and mastopexy to breast and nipple-areola reconstruction. Each chapter is introduced with a specific problem presented by Drs. Fisher and Handel. Then the second portion of the chapter features a variety of solutions from different experts for treating the problem. These experts provide case examples of similar problems with a step-by-step explanation of how they solved these problems and why they took the approach that they used. The book covers both aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of this text is not to judge which solution is the best (that decision is left to the reader). Rather, it is designed to provide a detailed road map explaining how to move from point A, the problem, to point B, the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beautifully Illustrated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dramatic color illustrations and numerous preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative images help readers visualize the steps of each operative solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book&#39;s approach is unique and should be of great educational value to surgeons-both residents and practitioners-in solving challenging problems and complications. Even more important, it will help them avoid problems and complications in future cases.&lt;/p&gt;" />
