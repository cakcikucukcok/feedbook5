  <title>Comprehensive Cleft Care: Family Edition - Joseph Losee, Richard. E. Kirschner, Darren Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For parents, learning that their newest family member may bring some unexpected challenges along with the blessing of his or her arrival can take a bit of adjustment. They have questions and need a trusted source of information to allay their fears. You are that source. However, most of the time, parents receive almost too much information to take in all at once, and questions arise as they digest the information. The parents of your patients may wonder: Did I hear that right? What does that term mean? What should I do next? What is in store for my family?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From diagnosis to treatment options, &lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive Cleft Care: A Family Edition&lt;/strong&gt; provides families with important information to help them fully understand their child&#39;s condition and its treatment. Authored by parents and professionals, this unique work was written with real-life challenges in mind. Two of the book&#39;s editors have raised cleft-affected children. As a result, the information provided is not only informative and helpful, but also personal, readily accessible, and relevant from a parent&#39;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book enables parents and families to play a central role in navigating their child&#39;s care while working alongside the rest of the care team. Written in easy-to-read language, it contains over two dozen short chapters that mirror topics discussed in the corresponding text written for health care professionals, &lt;em&gt;Comprehensive Cleft Care, Second Edition.&lt;/em&gt; Topics covered include the fundamentals of care, psychosocial and educational aspects, cleft lip and palate repair, speech and hearing, airway and breathing issues, dental and orthodontic principles, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By providing up-to-date information in a clear and concise format, this book can help to educate parents and to alleviate much of the anxiety they have regarding their child&#39;s condition and its treatment. Published with a complimentary eBook, this guide is an invaluable resource for families seeking to help their cleft-affected child reach his or her full potential.&lt;/p&gt;" />
