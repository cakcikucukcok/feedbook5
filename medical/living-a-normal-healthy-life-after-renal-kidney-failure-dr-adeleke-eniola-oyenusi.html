  <title>Living a Normal &amp; Healthy Life After Renal (Kidney) Failure - Dr. Adeleke Eniola Oyenusi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kidney transplantation is a total life changing event that each kidney failure patient waits for tirelessly. The emotions of the telephone call on that day when the author was informed that he had to report straightaway to the hospital for a kidney transplant was immeasurable, and will live forever in his memory.
With transplantation, a lot of things have to be taken into consideration; what to do and what to abstain from. Discovering how to prolong the life span of the kidney after transplantation made him think about writing part two of his story. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the kidney transplantation process, associated problems, and the positives for renal patients after successful transplantation so that they can understand how the changes they will face will affect their lives, and to know that they are not alone with this challenge.
His aim is to enlighten the general public and to create more awareness about kidney transplantation - one of the stages of living a normal and healthy life after renal (kidney) failure. He provides valuable information and education for renal patients with little or no knowledge of kidney transplant procedures; much can be learned and gained from the book." />
