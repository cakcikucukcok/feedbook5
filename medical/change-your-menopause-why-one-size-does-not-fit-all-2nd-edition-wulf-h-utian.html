  <title>Change Your Menopause: Why one size does not fit all. 2nd Edition - Wulf H Utian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;CHANGE &lt;em&gt;YOUR &lt;/em&gt;MENOPAUSE is not just &lt;em&gt;another &lt;/em&gt;book about menopause. It is &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;evidence and experience based menopause book written by &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; one person with the knowledge, inside information, and background to provide genuine facts, truths, solutions, and guidance, all supported by current scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;My body is changing. My mind is changing. I suffer real symptoms and I know I am not going crazy. My physician is not giving me answers. My friends confuse me with well-meant but meaningless advice. Every website I search is trying to sell me an expensive solution. I need help, real help, help I can trust. Where do I go? What do I do? Help!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cries for help like those above are the most frequent Wulf Utian, &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; pioneer of evidence-based menopause research and Founder of the North American Menopause Society, heard in over 40 years of clinical practice. Yes, well-known symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, and missed or irregular periods are those most often associated with menopause. But many other problems may drive women to seek help, problems about which many of today&amp;rsquo;s health providers have simply not been taught in current medical school programs. These real symptoms include things like reduced sex drive, vaginal discomfort and painful sex, changing memory, &amp;ldquo;got to go to the bathroom&amp;rdquo;, lack of energy, feeling blue, anxious or depressed, mood swings, waking up at night, dry eyes, thinning and dry skin, scalp hair loss, increased facial hair, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CHANGE &lt;em&gt;YOUR&lt;/em&gt; MENOPAUSE is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; key to better health and an enhanced quality of life. You &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;change &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; menopause&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Internationally recognized as &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;pioneer of contemporary menopause-related research and clinical care, Wulf Utian a reproductive endocrinologist and gynecologist, started the world&amp;rsquo;s first center dedicated to menopause research in Cape Town, South Africa, co-founded the International Menopause Society (IMS), and founded both The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) and the Council of Affiliated Menopause Societies (CAMS), all multidisciplinary scientific organizations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He is Professor Emeritus of Reproductive Biology and Obstetrics and Gynecology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, and a Consultant to the Cleveland Clinic. He is also Scientific Director of Rapid Medical Research Inc. As a practicing physician with over 40 years experience, he worked with thousands of women to help them enhance their quality of life. As an active clinical scientist he has published hundreds of research papers and commentaries. He has been a lecturer and teacher worldwide, and is sought after by the international media, academic centers, and the pharmaceutical industry, for authoritative opinion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now he draws on that considerable scientific knowledge and vast clinical experience to provide the real facts about menopause and how it represents the ideal opportunity to take control and enhance the quality of the second half of life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
