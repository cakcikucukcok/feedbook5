  <title>Kgmu Book of Clinical Cases in Dental Sciences - The Georgians</title>
      <meta name="description" content="King Georges Medical University and The Georgians 
King Georges Medical College (KGMC), now a University (KGMU), is one of the oldest medical institutions in India. Its foundation stone was laid in 1905 and the first batch of medical students was admitted in 1911. It was built by generous donations from eminent persons of the state of Oudh with their vision that the College should be the best in the East. With time, the College added departments, infrastructure, buildings and faculty and its alumni are called The Georgians. The Georgians have made name for themselves and their alma mater. 
The older buildings are in the Indo-Saracenic style, in keeping with ancient and royal buildings of this capital of Oudh. Some of these building have been declared as national heritage. KGMU has a sprawling campus, spread about 25 acres and is crossed by the River Gomti, two national highways, a railway line and a satellite campus soon to begin. 
The college was upgraded to a University in September 2002. Today KGMU ranks number one among state government funded institutions for medical and dental education in India. KGMU is the dream destination of undergraduate and post-graduate medical aspirants. This institution has been known for its teachers and unique style of teaching, a mixture of problem based and integrated styles, with a strong tradition of mentorship and bonding. 
The current Vice Chancellor is Prof. Ravi Kant, a Georgian. Under Prof Ravi Kants leadership, the University has seen a renaissance in the field of medical education. This KGMU Book of Clinical Cases is a set of two sister books, one for Medical Sciences and the other for Dental Sciences. These books showcase the academic experience and expertise of faculty and residents for continuing education of medical and dental fraternity." />
