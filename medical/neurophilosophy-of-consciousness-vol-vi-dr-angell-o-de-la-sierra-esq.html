  <title>Neurophilosophy of Consciousness, Vol. Vi - Dr. Angell O. de la Sierra Esq.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anyone who has ever enjoyed the honor to lecture a graduate school audience will tell you that simplicity in delivery as a goal is a worthwhile pragmatic and theoretical virtue if and only the expected and appropriate cognitive content are aimed at the student and not for self indulgence, independent of the corresponding level of complexity to be communicated. There is a tacit presumption that selling/marketing an idea by a professor implies there must be a buyer student purchase for a pedagogical transaction to be completed. Unless, of course, the professor, consciously knowing (or not) is engaged in a self-serving soliloquy assuming as primitive, self-evident complex propositions and often expressed as either inspired on a radical conceptual theosophy or based on a radical empirical, probable/statistical scientific lab result as characterized by extremist pronouncements. Yet, the very complex and changing nature of the object/event, in its dynamic evolutionary progression in our Minkowsky 4-d space time existential reality, opts to reveal its complexity to human audiences in the form of the simplest possible model-poems solution that are compatible with the students undeveloped  brain dynamics phenomenology and combinatorial limitations, as amply detailed in our other publications. We now expand further on the justifications for our general poem on the evolution of complexity as discussed under The Immanent Invariant and the Transcendental Transforming Horizons. We need to harmonize integrative the exotic idealistic speculations and conjectures of conceptual models with the empirical/pragmatic measurements coming out of the lab.  See Ch. 12, Nurophilosophy of Consciousness., Vol. IV and Vol. V." />
