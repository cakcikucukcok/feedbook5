      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Best of Women&#39;s Health&lt;/i&gt; brings to the forefront progressive information on the various medical conditions that affect women in the 21st century. But the informative guide also discusses the social, racial, economic, health care disparities and other inequities that illustrate the alarming differences between how men and women are cared for by our society and the United States government.&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Valiere Alcena shares his vast experience as a practicing physician and researcher as he describes the symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of today&#39;s most common female diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, cancer, anemia, arthritis, osteoporosis, lung diseases, depression, alcoholism, and HIV/AIDS. Dr. Alcena provides intricate details, figures, and graphs that illustrate the inner-workings of the female body as well as practical information on various topics such as the:&lt;p&gt;
Most effective diet for optimal health
Reasons for iron deficiency
Symptoms of major depression
Factors that bring on a migraine &lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Best of Women&#39;s Health&lt;/i&gt; will teach women to take charge of their health and demand positive change in our health care system, ultimately ensuring that the female population in our country receives the care they deserve-not only today, but in the future." />
