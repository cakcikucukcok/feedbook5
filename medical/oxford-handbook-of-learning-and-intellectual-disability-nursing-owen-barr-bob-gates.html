  <title>Oxford Handbook of Learning and Intellectual Disability Nursing - Owen Barr, Bob Gates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This new edition of the Oxford Handbook of Learning and Intellectual Disability Nursing has been fully updated, with a greater focus on older people with learning and intellectual disabilities and mental health issues, as well as bringing all recommendations in line with current guidelines.
Since the first edition of this book was published, services for people with learning disabilities and their families have become more community-based, and the demography of the population of people with learning disabilities has changed to include many older people, and children and young adults with complex physical health needs. This handbook provides clear information for readers on practical steps that may be taken to actively engage with people who have learning disabilities, to enable
effective care in which they are involved as much as possible with decisions that affect them. This book also covers differences in legislation and social policy across the constituent countries in the United Kingdom and Ireland, including changes that have been implemented since serious case reviews
into institutional abuse. An emergencies section provides key information at critical times in practice. The chapter on practice resources has been fully revised to bring together the latest tools to support nurses, complete with links for easy access.
Written by experienced practitioners who are recognised experts in their areas of speciality, the Oxford Handbook of Learning and Intellectual Disability Nursing is an invaluable guide for students, community and hospital based nurses, and all those who work with people with intellectual disabilities as part of a multidisciplinary team." />
