  <title>The Physician&#39;s Survival Guide for the Hospital - Samuel H. Steinberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Doctors need hospitals and hospitals need doctors. Then why do they continue to communicate their needs to each other so badly? Why all the animosity, conflict, and mistrust?&lt;/p&gt;
In &lt;I&gt;The Physician&#39;s Survival Guide for the Hospital&lt;/I&gt;, Dr. Samuel H. Steinberg, an experienced hospital administrator, solves this problem by revealing the information needed for each of these groups to be successful in the hospital environment. Practice administrators will learn skills and information to help them improve their job performance and enhance their standing with their colleagues. Hospital administrators will learn what physicians need to take care of their patients. Physicians, those just starting their practice as well as the more seasoned, will learn the best and most efficient ways to get their hospital work accomplished. They will also become skilled at managing their hospital practice, thus making it a more enjoyable and rewarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;
Step-by-step, &lt;I&gt;The Physician&#39;s Survival Guide for the Hospital&lt;/I&gt; takes you through all of the issues of the physician-hospital practice in order to generate better teamwork, avoid common pitfalls and mistakes, and provide a road map to make the hospital a better place for patients and staff.&lt;/p&gt;" />
