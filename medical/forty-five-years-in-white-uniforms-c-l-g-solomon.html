  <title>Forty-Five Years in White Uniforms - C.L.G. Solomon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Forty five years in white uniforms
	From the pen of the same writer of the book Natural Bread Is Not Enough comes a partial biographical account of her forty-five-year nursing career. Seventeen years were spent working in various disciplines of nursing, while the final twenty-eight years were spent working in public health nursing.
	In keeping with HIPPA laws, which are designed to protect the privacy of clients and their information, no part of this writing at any point ever divulges anyones name or records. The information is recollected from various work experiences, in various cities and states, over a period of years.
	Forty-five years have not qualified me to be an authority in the nursing field. It has simply given me various insights that someone else may read about and make a quality career decision. I had classmates who dropped out of nursing school and stated, Nursing definitely is not for me.
	Some students failed because they underestimated the amount of study and dedication involved in becoming a nurse. Some students were not willing to spend long hours in study and research. Some found that the sights and smells of blood and other body fluids were definite turnoffs.
	One other classmate completed the entire nursing program with a 4.0 average, only to say she hated it. She never practiced a day of nursing. She excelled in clinicals as well as in the classroom. She received the highest academic award in our class, yet nursing was not her cup of tea.
	The experiences that I encountered in my personal life somewhat intensified my desire to become a nurse. I am happy to have been able to practice the kind of work that was very satisfying to me. The nursing knowledge that paralleled certain difficult times in my life was priceless.
	Nursing is the type of profession that one can practice in different settings with various categories of people, such as the aged, the middle aged, the young adults, the teens, the expectant moms and their childrenthe newborn, premature babiesand people with special needs.
	Work settings run the gamut from hospitals to jails, institutions, the military, private homes, clinics, schools, rehabilitation centers of different types, and other settings not mentioned. Someone once said, Variety is the spice of life. Variety abounds in the nursing profession.
	A nurse can expand on her career by becoming an advanced registered nurse practitioner, nurse anesthetist, midwife, legal consultant, or she may go on to medical school to be a physician. Nurses also train other nurses. Administration is another career option within nursing.
	One of the first things a prospective nurse needs to consider is which type of program she should choose. Some students choose the certified nursing assistant (CNA) program. They want to obtain some of the basic skills and a quick job. These skills often include learning to take vital signs, such as blood pressure, pulse, and respiration.
	They learn how to do basic care and other skills that can assist the nurse in his/her work. CNA skills can serve as a pivotal point for the person to move higher into the medical profession. Some certified nursing assistants advance their training and become registered nurses and doctors.
	Nurses are trained in programs of different length and at different levels. Licensed practical nurses, or LPNS, may train one or more years depending on where they train. Registered nurses, or RNs, may complete an associates degree and start work after licensure. RNs may also complete a four-year baccalaureate-degree program. All levels must be certified.
	Some medical facilities offer CNA training whereby a student may work and train in their facility at the same time. Upon completion of training, the student is expected to work for the institution for a contracted amount of time. The student may stop at this level or move further into the profession.
	Associate and baccalaureate programs are located on College campuses. A C" />
