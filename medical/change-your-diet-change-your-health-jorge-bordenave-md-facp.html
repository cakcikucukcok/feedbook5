  <title>Change Your Diet, Change Your Health - Jorge Bordenave Md Facp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The doctor of the future will prescribe no medicine, but will want to educate their patients in the care of the body, proper diet, and disease prevention.&quot; ~ Thomas A. Edison.
What was old, is very new again.
Food is medicine, and the foods we eat can either help us maintain our health, or be a principal cause of illness.
The epidemics of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, digestive disorders, cancers and even Alzheimers disease, have been associated with the increase consumption of nutrition poor, highly processed, inexpensive and easily acquired fast foods and snacks that taste great, but that are loaded with fats and sugars.  		       Food production has become industrialized and utilizes an assortment of chemical additives.									             Chemical toxins given the name of obesogens are being identified as another contributor to the increased levels of obesity, as well as to obesity related diseases.
The increased amounts of food we eat, the lower nutritional quality of the food production and a decrease in levels of physical activity has changed society and has made the United States a country where a third to forty percent of the children are overweight or obese;" />
