  <title>A Chance Meeting with Life - Jan Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Jacqueline Price who was born with &lt;em&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/em&gt; and made it out of childhood with many memorable slumber parties, snow days, beach trips, and hospitalizations. &amp;nbsp;She loved attending &lt;strong&gt;Robinson High School&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Radford University&lt;/strong&gt;, majoring in &lt;em&gt;Finance&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Living in &lt;strong&gt;Raleigh, North Carolina&lt;/strong&gt; and then moving back home to &lt;strong&gt;Northern Virginia&lt;/strong&gt; went smoothly enough. &amp;nbsp;Working at a &lt;em&gt;German grocery giant, Lid&lt;/em&gt;, and living among friends by the &lt;strong&gt;Mosaic District&lt;/strong&gt;, a fun mixed-use community along the &lt;em&gt;D.C. Metro subway system&lt;/em&gt; was quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Then something terrible happened due to the cystic fibrosis. As it happens, her childhood hospital not far away, &lt;strong&gt;Fairfax Hospital&lt;/strong&gt;, and specifically their &lt;strong&gt;Heart and Vascular Institute&lt;/strong&gt; and more specifically the doctors and nurses within the &lt;em&gt;CardioVascular Intensive Care Unit&lt;/em&gt;, saved Jacqueline&amp;rsquo;s life. &amp;nbsp;This is the story of how, with many stories within this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I, her mother, Jan Price, remained there from morning to night every day for weeks and weeks and focused solely on the survival of our daughter, except I was able to write. &amp;nbsp;Every day, I wrote about what I witnessed. I wrote about our daughter&amp;rsquo;s medical tidal wave and recovery, and about what was going on in my own head. It was tough but tough was doable and so we did. &amp;nbsp;And they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the story of doctors and nurses and teams of teams, of specialists, remarkable people with the medical skills to do remarkable things. &amp;nbsp;Imagine no more. Everyone should read this story because it is a story about a part of life few witness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As you read this story, stay with me. At this point in my life, I am first a mom. You may think I love our daughter the most because this story is about her, but I have a good husband and we also have a son we love as immeasurably. Moms with more spectacular lives still say that loving their children is most important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Down on the list yet close to the top, I love writing. I am a writer only in that I have a story to tell. By profession, I taught young children to read and taught older children who were in trouble, from elementary school to alternative high school. By profession and in my personal life, I have been a problem solver. I have not been a writer by profession. My personal life has made me a writer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Forgive my fragmented sentences, terms not well explained, the parts that may fumble along, as I fumbled along in the complex matrix. You will get to know me as a wife and a mother, as an observer, as a person who watches and thinks and makes sense of this world. You will get to know my version of the capabilities of an incredible and complex medical community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am not a medical expert nor intend to convey that I am. My interpretations come from living with and helping, at a deep level, people with serious medical conditions. I am a wife and mother who has learned a lot over many years. Please do go to the proper sources, as we have, for proper medical advice. I do advise selecting medical experts judiciously and then following their direction vigilantly. Allow them, unencumbered, to apply their long-acquired, complex skillsets. Listen more than speak. And appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I did not write this story to help people. That is a daunting responsibility I cannot assume. My intention in writing Jackie&amp;rsquo;s story is to capture it in words, for the reader to get to know our family, the life of our daughter, and to understand what I went through and she went through at the hands of our medical community. I answer the question, &amp;ldquo;What happened to Jackie?&amp;rdquo; and give Jackie a chance to witness through words my raw interpretation of being her mother.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
