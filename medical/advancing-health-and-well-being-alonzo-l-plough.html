  <title>Advancing Health and Well-Being - Alonzo L. Plough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;The case for evidence and collaboration in pursuit of health equity&lt;/strong&gt;
In this second volume of the Culture of Health series, &lt;em&gt;Advancing Health and Well-Being&lt;/em&gt; convenes experts from academia, policy, journalism, and community-based organizations, among other sectors, to examine how data and narrative can catalyze progress toward building a national Culture of Health.
Tackling topics such as health inequity, mass incarceration, and climate change, &lt;em&gt;Advancing Health and Well-Being&lt;/em&gt; does more than draw lines between cause and effect; its 70+ voices lend context and lived experience to critical conversations that may lack such elements. The result is a work that shows the power and promise of evidence and collaboration.
Amid continued interest in population health and well-being, this book offers essential reading for those advancing such efforts, and those seeking an early grounding, in pursuit of a Culture of Health." />
