  <title>Vortex of Feelings: The Early Months: Book II The Psychological Survival Guide for Parents - Paul Peebles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a society where two-thirds of divorces occur within six years of having a child, the first few months can be a crucial time for establishing healthy parental roles and routines. In &lt;em&gt;Vortex of Feelings: The Early Months, &lt;/em&gt;Book II of the groundbreaking series &lt;em&gt;The Psychological Survival Guide for Parents&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Paul Peebles returns with a frank and fresh discussion about tricky and taboo topics rarely discussed in other pregnancy/child/family literature. Picking up where he left off in Book I, &lt;em&gt;OMG! We&amp;#39;re Pregnant&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Peebles examines the first months of infancy, a time that can be wrought with anxiety and exhaustion for parents, and, if navigated thoughtfully, moments of pure bliss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vortex of Feelings: The Early Months &lt;/em&gt;wades into common concerns like bonding and breast-feeding, and its feelings, and thornier topics like the pros and cons of &amp;ldquo;Attachment Parenting,&amp;rdquo; the disruption of sexual relationships, and the danger of father&amp;rsquo;s feeling &amp;ldquo;odd man out.&amp;rdquo; Dr. Peebles anticipates problems and provides parents with the tools to raise a healthy, happy baby without sacrificing their own intimacy. Dr. Peebles reminds new parents that what&amp;rsquo;s most important is not the process but the result. In a book that is ultimately about family and how to keep it together, Dr. Peebles offers solutions to issues that can help save your sanity and your &lt;strong&gt;Relationships&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vortex of Feelings&lt;/em&gt; tackles issues like the Pros and Cons of &amp;ldquo;Attachment Parenting,&amp;rdquo; Bonding, Breast &amp;ldquo;Feelings,&amp;rdquo; Fears and Losses, Odd Man Out Theory, Setting Boundaries with Grandparents, Guilt and Magic, the Intruder Complex, Loss of Libido, Postpartum Depression, Rituals and Rites, Sleep, the self-defeating Success Neurosis, Infant Temperament, &amp;ldquo;Wish versus Reality,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Rescue versus Empathy,&amp;rdquo; Spoiling a Baby?, Ghosts in the Nursery, and (of course) Working Outside the Home. Interspersed throughout the book also are many important practical recommendations for caring for a new baby, and yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is about relationships, and intrusions into those relationships.
