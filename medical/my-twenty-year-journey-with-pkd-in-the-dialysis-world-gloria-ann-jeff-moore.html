  <title>My Twenty Year Journey with Pkd in the Dialysis World - Gloria Ann Jeff-Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After self-publishing my very first book to share my dialysis experience, many of my readers wanted to know more about my 20 year journey with PKD in the Dialysis World, and I did just that, not only they hear about my 20 year experience, they will travel with me through my journey from my pre-dialysis days to my current PD days.  After being on dialysis 10 years with PKD, I decided it was time to learn exactly what is PKD, and after learning more about PKD, I began to research my family history of the disease, and discovered some very interesting facts about my family.  I decided to share this discovery in this second book.  You will get an education about PKD, and even learn what are the signs and symptoms of PKD.  I also share my first transplant experience, this book is packed with info that could be potentially beneficial to pending dialysis pts, as well as fairly new diaylsis patients.  And last but not least, I invite my readers for a repeat invite into Glos renal friendly kitchen, to check out some more recipes, plus some repeated recipes from my first book &quot;My Renal Life&quot; (i know it, i live it), you will be delighted with the array of recipes that I share, plus I include some nutritional facts to help in accomodating a renal diet needs." />
