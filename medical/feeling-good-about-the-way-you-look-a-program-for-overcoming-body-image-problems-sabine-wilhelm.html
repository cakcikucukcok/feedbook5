  <title>Feeling Good about the Way You Look: A Program for Overcoming Body Image Problems - Sabine Wilhelm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;In a society where a blemish or &amp;#8220;bad hair&amp;#8221; can ruin an otherwise perfect day and airbrushed abs dominate the magazine rack, many of us feel ashamed of our bodies. If dissatisfaction with your looks is a distressing preoccupation, this compassionate book offers a way to break free from the mirror. Harvard psychologist Sabine Wilhelm leads you through a step-by-step program that helps you fight the urge to spend hours &amp;#8220;fixing&amp;#8221; your skin and hair, working out, or shopping for flattering clothes. Reality-check exercises based on cognitive-behavioral therapy demonstrate how to identify unfounded beliefs about your appearance. Once you understand the negative thoughts and feelings that distort your self-image, you&amp;#8217;ll be able to shed lengthy grooming rituals and overcome the embarrassment that keeps you from enjoying life. With Dr. Wilhelm&amp;#8217;s expert guidance, you&amp;#8217;ll learn to replace self-doubt and insecurity with confidence and a positive outlook. Whether you&amp;#8217;ve spent thousands on plastic surgery or avoid trips to the beach, dating, or socializing, you owe yourself this opportunity to make peace with your looks. If you or someone you care about is struggling with a body image problem, effective care is finally at hand. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Health care professionals, see also the related treatment manual: &lt;I&gt;Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Body Dysmorphic Disorder&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
