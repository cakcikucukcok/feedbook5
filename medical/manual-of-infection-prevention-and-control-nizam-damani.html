  <title>Manual of Infection Prevention and Control - Nizam Damani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In recent years, we have begun to recognise the rising threat of Multidrug Resistant Organisms (MDORs), and the profound impact that healthcare associated infections (HCAIs), such as MRSA, can have on both patient safety and quality of care. HCAIs prolong patients&#39; hospital stays, and increase morbidity as well as mortality rates, yet diagnosing and treating these infections is a costly process that can place intense pressure on already limited healthcare resources.
The updated and significantly expanded new edition of Manual of Infection Prevention and Control is a practical handbook that provides a comprehensive overview of HCAI control and prevention in all healthcare facilities. Clear diagrams and quick-access tables give step-by-step instructions to guide the reader through real-life prevention strategies such as hand wash, disinfection, and sterilisation. A truly current and global source, this book also includes information regarding
infection outbreak management, and detailed sections on specific pathogens such as swine flu, C Difficile, ESBL, MRSA, E.coli 0157, XDR-TB, and Ebola.
Manual of Infection Prevention and Control is a fully illustrated, evidence based guide for doctors, nurses, and public health physicians working to prevent the spreading of infectious diseases - most particularly HCAIs. It is also a valuable reference for environmental health officers, health educators, practice managers in GP surgeries, and health service managers." />
