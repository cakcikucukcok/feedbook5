  <title>Navigating the Complexities of Stroke - Louis R. Caplan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Strokes afflict thousands of people every year. Yet, for every fatal case, many more victims survive, often going on to live long, productive lives. Of course, none of it is simple-not preventing a brain attack, nor survival, rehabilitation, or living with cerebrovascular disease. The key is education, for both the moment of crisis and the long term.  Navigating the Complexities of Stroke provides a practical guide for the lay public and medical professionals. Dr. Louis R. Caplan, one of the worlds leading experts, guides readers through the subject in a straightforward and accessible manner. He examines the anatomy of the brain, explaining the specialized functions of different regions, and describes the flow of blood from the heart. He turns to the mechanics of the stroke itself, clearly discussing the complexities of the two major kinds-the ischemic and hemorrhagic-and the resulting damage. Most helpfully, Caplan offers information and advice that readers will find immediately useful: the medical conditions and other factors that create risk, stroke symptoms, abnormalities that doctors look for, tests available to evaluate strokes, complications and disabilities that can result, and the paths of treatment and rehabilitation. He offers real-life cases of victims and their families that demonstrate successful recovery, but also reveal the sometimes troubling impact of strokes on survivors and their families, who can suffer frustration and demoralization that the medical profession often overlooks in its biological focus. Caplan also examines strokes in children and young adults, who are often neglected in literature that is largely aimed at seniors.   Navigating the Complexities of Stroke empowers victims, families, and general medical providers. It puts in readers hands the knowledge necessary to avoid strokes, address them quickly, and effectively recover, so they wont lose heart when it is needed most." />
