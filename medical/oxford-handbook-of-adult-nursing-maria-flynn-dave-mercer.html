  <title>Oxford Handbook of Adult Nursing - Maria Flynn, Dave Mercer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With a brand new team of expert authors, the second edition of the central series title the Oxford Handbook of Adult Nursing has been completely rewritten for today&#39;s nurse. Brought fully up to date with the latest nursing competencies and professional knowledge, it ensures you have everything you need to deliver appropriate nursing care and interventions. Designed to reflect the NMC nursing competencies, it covers key nursing values and standards,
communication, clinical practice and decision making, and professional development.
The Oxford Handbook of Adult Nursing is written by nurses, for nurses, to provide concise, practical, and expert advice on all aspects of the nurse&#39;s role. Designed as a comprehensive and reliable guide to the care of adults, this new edition reflects how nurses relate to patients, engage critically with professional knowledge, and organise and deliver appropriate nursing care and interventions. With concise and comprehensive summaries of key nursing values and communication skills
when dealing with diverse clinical populations, the role of the nurse is fully detailed as a provider of clinical care, as well as a leader, manager, and member of a broad multidisciplinary team. Clinical nursing practice is addressed using a systems-based approach, providing an overview of clinical conditions,
investigations, and treatments, including frequently prescribed medicines, while highlighting key nursing practice considerations.
Each chapter of the handbook lists useful sources of further information, primarily easily-accessible on-line resources. To help you achieve the best possible results for your patients, the authors offer a wealth of recommendations, guidance and information from their years of experience.
Together with the complementary Oxford Handbook of Clinical Skills in Adult Nursing, this handbook provides nursing students and general adult nurses with a robust framework for thinking about, and practicing, safe and compassionate, values based nursing. Whether the reader needs a comprehensive introduction to adult nursing or a reliable resource to dip into when the need arises, the Oxford Handbook of Adult Nursing will be an invaluable companion for years to
come." />
