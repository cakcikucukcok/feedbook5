  <title>When Less Is More - Bethanne Snodgrass, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you have ever thought that your breasts are too big, this book is for you. Do you suffer from chronic back and neck pain? Do you struggle to sit up straight? What about frequent headaches or hand numbness? Disabling muscle and joint pain, discolored shoulder grooves from your bra straps, and rashes under your breasts are just some of the symptoms caused by heavy breasts. Many large-breasted women also suffer psychologically from poor body image and unwanted sexual attention. Sound familiar? If so, &lt;em&gt;When Less Is More&lt;/em&gt; will provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision about a procedure that can transform your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breast reduction is among the top ten most commonly performed major plastic surgical procedures, as common as facelift surgery. Most women experience dramatic symptom relief and emotional benefits after the procedure. In fact, the vast majority of women who have breast reduction surgery would have it again or recommend it to a friend. Even celebrities are speaking out about their breast reductions and the life-changing benefits they have experienced as a result. However, making the decision to have surgery can be difficult, and most women consider it for years before taking action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, despite the media attention and increasing frequency of the procedure, there is an alarming lack of accurate information regarding the surgery and its indications. Many doctors still recommend weight loss as an effective way to reduce breast size without scientific evidence to support this approach. Insurance companies often further confuse and complicate matters by using strict, one-size-fits-all guidelines to determine coverage eligibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Less Is More&lt;/em&gt; offers much-needed help for women suffering with large breasts by providing reliable information to help them answer critical questions:&lt;blockquote&gt;Will the surgery help me?&lt;br /&gt;Are there alternatives to surgery?&lt;br /&gt;How do I find a good doctor?&lt;br /&gt;Will my insurance pay for the surgery?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also includes immediate steps you can take to help relieve pain, such as finding a well-fitting bra, and features a fully illustrated physical therapy program. To help you face surgery with confidence, Dr. Snodgrass also discusses many details that doctors don&amp;#8217;t have time to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be a teenager trying to hide your breast size, a corporate executive, a stay-at-home mom, or a grandmother with deep grooves in your shoulders from your bra straps. Whoever you are or whatever your circumstances, the bottom line is you want to look and feel better. Breast reduction is one of the most effective surgeries available to help you do that, and &lt;em&gt;When Less Is More&lt;/em&gt; gives you the essential information you need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
