  <title>What Hurts the Physician Hurts the Patient: MedRAP - Iris Mushin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Hurts the Physician Hurts the Patient&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; describes MedRAP, a comprehensive program designed to advance the professional growth of medical trainees and improve their well-being by addressing factors that lead to stress and burnout. The program focuses on facilitating the transition into the medical training environment and improving the organizational culture. The program also focuses on addressing ACGME competencies such as communication and interpersonal skills, professionalism, and systems-based practice skills. The Quality Improvement (QI) component of the program involves the entire health care team to facilitate collaboration and improve the efficiency of the hospital work environment and patient care. Because of MedRAP&amp;rsquo;s efficient design, maximum benefits for medical training programs can be achieved with a judicious commitment of time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medrap.prg&quot;&gt;www.medrap.org.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What People are saying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;What Hurts the Physician Hurts the Patient&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is the result of a career&amp;#39;s work and labor of love by Ms. Iris Mushin, who was an MBA student at the time she initiated MedRAP. Subsequently, she directed the program over two decades. Ms. Mushin has now produced a wonderful publication describing MedRAP, which addresses training, professional development, and the well-being of Medical residents. This publication is comprehensive and clearly written, and will be of enormous value to graduate medical education. I highly recommend this book to all medical residents, resident program directors, department chairs, and administrators who are connected with the training of new physicians. Ms. Mushin has made an enormous contribution not only to resident training at Baylor, but also to the overall training of residents in the United States.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;- &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antonio Gotto, Jr., MD, DPhil.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dean Emeritus, Weill Cornell Medicine&lt;br /&gt;
Provost for Medical Affairs Emeritus, Cornell University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;As Chief of Medicine at Ben Taub Hospital, chairman of the Internal Medicine Department and the Dean of Graduate Medical Education at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) during the implementation of MedRAP, I came to appreciate the many benefits of such a program for any residency program or medical institution. During the 25 years of this program, I have witnessed firsthand the benefits for resident morale and team building... The Quality Improvement component of MedRAP was developed to improve both education and patient care. With the introduction of the Core Competencies by ACGME, this program became essential to meeting the milestones expected for accreditation. This comprehensive and thoughtful book will be of valuable benefit for program directors, as well as for other institutional leaders and non-physician training programs. I highly recommend this excellent work.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Stephen B.
