  <title>Diving Medical Acupuncture - Janneke Vermeulen, Will Maclean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nose, sinus, ear and other medical conditions can result in complications while diving. The most common problem experienced by divers is not being able to clear their ears due to ENT disorders; however, these can be effectively treated with acupuncture. Through in-depth knowledge of Western diving medicine, diving techniques and Chinese medicine, the author prescribes acupuncture diagnostics and treatment for these ENT disorders.
Designed for acupuncturists and Chinese medicine practitioners, this book describes the medical conditions that are either exacerbated by or caused by diving and other water sports, with effective clinical treatments. Complete with anatomical diagrams and acupuncture point charts, this is a practical resource for acupuncture clinicians who deal with the issues that are complicated by diving that also present in their general practice. Advice for patients is given at the end of each chapter, and is available as a handout in downloadable form." />
