  <title>Children and Environmental Toxins: What Everyone Needs to Know® - Philip J. Landrigan, Mary M. Landrigan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="More than 80,000 new chemicals have been developed and released into the global environment during the last four decades. Today the World Health Organization attributes more than one-third of all childhood deaths to environmental causes, and as rates of childhood disease skyrocket -- autism, asthma, ADHD, obesity, diabetes, and even birth defects -- it raises serious, difficult questions around how the chemical environment is impacting children&#39;s health.
&lt;em&gt;Children and Environmental Toxins: What Everyone Needs to Know&amp;#174;&lt;/em&gt; offers an accessible guide to understanding and identifying the potential sources of harm in a child&#39;s environment. Written by experts in pediatrics and environmental health and formatted in an easy to follow question-and-answer format, it offers parents, care providers, and activists a reliable introduction to a hotly debated topic.
As the burdens of environmental toxins and disease continue to defy borders, this book provides a new benchmark to understanding the potential threats in our environment and food. No parent or care provider should be without it." />
