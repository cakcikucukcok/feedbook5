  <title>Asking the Right Questions to Get the Health Care You Need - James Cappleman Lcsw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Families experiencing the stress of a chronic or serious illness typically find themselves forced to make many life-altering decisions, and often with little time to contemplate the best course of action. This book serves as a practical guide to help what all of us will one day experience when we find ourselves sorting through the complex maze of obtaining good health care. Unlike other books written by doctors, nurses, and chaplains, this book comes from the perspective of a social worker who knows first hand the struggles families experience with obtaining the right information so that good decisions can be made.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Written with the idea in mind that the reader may be experiencing an exorbitant amount of stress, the book is laid out in direct, straightforward, and easy language to help with the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
good communication with the health care team
establishment of goals for care and getting everyone on board
the different ways to ensure you&#39;re heard when you can&#39;t speak for yourself
what to do (and not to do) during a hospitalization
the secrets to selecting a good nursing home
what to do when someone refuses to go to a nursinghome
choices available when a situation becomes terminal
how to help prevent a financial crisis during a health crisis
ways to get needed medications when you can&#39;t afford it
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a book that all of us will need someday if not now.
