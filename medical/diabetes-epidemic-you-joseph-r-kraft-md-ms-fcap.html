  <title>Diabetes Epidemic &amp; You - Joseph R. Kraft Md Ms. Fcap</title>

&lt;p&gt;
DIABETES EPIDEMIC and YOU is not a clich! It is a mandate for the awakening of the &quot;silent&quot; millions worldwide with &quot;normal&quot; fasting blood sugars and undiagnosed diabetes. If you have a &quot;normal&quot; fasting blood sugar, YOU may be one of the undiagnosed millions. YES, I do mean YOU.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since Hippocrates&#39; time, earliest diagnosis provided the greatest opportunity for treatment and cure. This book highlights the earliest identification of type 2 diabetes by utilizing the insulin assay with the oral glucose tolerance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My cumulative experience of 14,384 oral glucose tolerances with insulin assays established the earliest diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes when the blood sugars were normal. Prediabetes is type 2 diabetes. The tolerances were separated according to age groups, from 313 years to 8190+ years. Each group was further divided into normal glucose tolerances, impaired glucose tolerances, and diabetes mellitus glucose tolerances. YOU, upon testing by oral glucose tolerance, will be in one of these categories.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This resource of oral glucose tolerance with insulin assay is unequaled in world medical literature. The importance of early diagnosis is that the clinical pathology of diabetes  mainly heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, cataracts, erectile dysfunction, and other metabolic disorders  occurs not only in those with advanced diabetes, but also in those with &quot;normal&quot; blood sugars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
YES, this could happen to YOU! When early diagnosis is coupled with specific therapy, the DIABETES EPIDEMIC will be arrested and then reversed. Early diagnosis is the goal of this book  beginning with YOU.
