  <title>A Guide for the Nurse Entrepreneur - Eva M. Francis Rn Msn Ccrn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book is to share  with  Healthcare professionals the alternatives that are available to them so they can elevate their lives, elevate their impact and their influence as they grow in their nursing or Healthcare Career. 
I want to give Healthcare Professionals, particularly nurses, a glimpse of other areas they can embrace to touch the lives of those they are assigned to, or rather those that they are called to serve.
I want to empower you to be all you can be. So many of us put limits on what we can achieve, when in reality we were all born to be great, and to do great things. We are as ordinary as we think we are. We will only achieve what we can conceive in our minds. I am a strong believer that we should always be progressing upwards in life, consistently and purposefully. In other words, the sky in NOT the limit." />
