  <title>How to Interview the Coach - Kenneth Parady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Former executive in domestic and international markets specializing in various industries. Spent six (6) years developing a plastic pipeline liner used in the pipeline transport industry. Trained large marketing and sales forces using goal setting and mental focus skills. 
A twenty-five-year veteran of college, high school football, basketball officiating. The outrage surrounding the college scholarship scandals in the 90s led to development of a method for athletes to market themselves to the colleges in a more professional manner. Hundreds of athletes who were never contacted by any coach received dozens of letters of interest using this program. Requirements were a 3.0+ GPA, strong teacher/coaches recommendations, and solid character traits. The student/athlete experienced the recruiting process by writing their own sports resumes. The experience writing successful resumes and interviews with the coaches prepared them for their future job-hunting process.
The future for the Mental Game Plan is to make it available to the thousands of high schools in the United States that would teach athletes the skills of goal setting, meeting objectives, and focusing on the task at hand. These skills would be obtained through athletics since sports has a higher interest to most students. A good athlete could become a good student by learning these skills that are not successfully being taught today.
Learning these skills to improve mental focus and goal setting would build mental discipline for use in the student/athletes future life experiences." />
