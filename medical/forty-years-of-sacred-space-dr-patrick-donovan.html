  <title>Forty Years of Sacred Space - Dr. Patrick Donovan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After forty-three years in the sacred space of caring for patients, Dr. Donovan shares his observations and thoughts about illness and healing. He believes illness serves us by acting as lifes transformative process. As such, the journey through our illness may be precisely the very experiential journey we need to realize our healing and ourselves more fully. After all, we dont get cancer. Cancer, like any illness, is a process. We are the cancer we manifest. Our cancer arises out of our own tissues and cellular make up. To rid our self of our cancer is to rid our self of a part of our self. Instead of thinking about illness as something we get, something separate from ourselves needing to be removed or defeated, Dr. Donovan thinks we might well do better viewing our illness as a transformational journey that must be undertaken and completed for our healing to emerge. We cant get rid of our selves but we can transform ourselves and our illness provides us with that opportunity. It allows us our healing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
