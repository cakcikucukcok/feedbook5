  <title>Achievement: Cancer Free For 20 Years - Curly Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A humorous how to book, full of tips, tools, techniques, and the secrets I used to overcome cancer which I share with you in the hope you will be inspired. I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and an aggressive form of lymphatic cancer in 1992 and I was given a maximum of nine months to live. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Inspiring, uplifting and funny read&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Prue Gent. &amp;nbsp;This book is all about my fascinating and funny 20 year journey from cancer to coaching. Around the same times as my diagnosis I became homeless and I was unemployed. I now live a passionate, exciting, healthy, wealthy, happy life. My story tells of my passage through the conventional medical approach consisting of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This is then rapidly followed by funny tales of my experimenting with alternative therapies, sampling some weird concoctions and cultivating unusual remedies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Curly&amp;rsquo;s book is flush with guidance to have self-mastery in the face of adversity. These tricks of positivity are not just for the fearful and sick, but for all of us; I guides and tempts us to greater psychological wellbeing and well &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo;. Thinking well and taking care of our bodies, as Curly suggests, provides all of us with an easily applied set of life-changes that will not only make us feel better every day, but may help save our lives too.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/em&gt;Professor Angus McLeod, PhD&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I believe that cancer can be the most powerful catalyst for change. I have deliberately written in a style which combines storytelling and facts with the hope to entertain you and educate you at the same time. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;A very interesting, amusing, and thought provoking book.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; Jackie Hammans.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since the terminal diagnosis, I have become an international bestselling author of, The Coaching Handbook Series of books. I am a highly sought-after international speaker, a pioneer of life coach training and the founder of a very successful training company, Achievement Specialists Limited. I combine my personal experiences with accepted methodologies and cutting edge innovations, to create exciting, entertaining and effective approaches to living a healthy, happy and successful life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Her story is leagues away from being a &amp;lsquo;misery memoir&amp;rsquo; and instead becomes a celebration of life, with hard earned insights which empower the reader to develop the resilience to tackle serious situations and overcome them to build a better life. In essence, this book is inspiring reading for anyone involved in any way with a terminal illness, as well a poignant reminder for all of us healthy creatures to fight the temptation to take the richness of life for granted.&amp;nbsp; Highly recommended&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; Grant Willcox&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within the book I examines the need to be prepared for hospital visits, to expect to have some setbacks and what it is like living with early menopause. I plan a farewell party and raises money for cancer charities. I spend time on using humour as a healer, on drinking Ojibway Indian tea, visiting the neuro-linguistic programming museum of old beliefs, using lashings of fake tanning and removing mercury teeth fillings, to mention only a few of the topics. I cover a lot of alternative options all of which I have tried or explored. There is a lot of information in this book portrayed I hope, in a witty and laugh out loud style.&lt;/p&gt;" />
