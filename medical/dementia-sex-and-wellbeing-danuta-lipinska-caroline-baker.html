  <title>Dementia, Sex and Wellbeing - Danuta Lipinska, Caroline Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Despite being integral parts of all our identities, sexuality, sex and intimacy are what many would call the Last Taboo in dementia care, usually seen as &#39;problem behaviours&#39; to be stopped and dealt with. 
Informed by a combination of accessible neuroscience and person-centred compassion, Danuta Lipinska&#39;s new book shows that the human need for intimacy, attachment and sexual expression is as important for supporting the wellbeing and personhood of people with dementia as communication and care. Considering the brain as the body&#39;s biggest sex organ, it examines the cognitive changes that occur in dementia and what these changes mean in the context of sexual behaviour and consent. Applying straightforward methods and drawing on many conversations with men and women living with dementia, the book is a revealing read for those living with dementia and their families, as well as the professionals working with them. It ultimately explains how it&#39;s possible to understand and support the sexual identity and wellbeing of people who have dementia, while addressing the fine balance between vulnerability and the right to self-expression." />
