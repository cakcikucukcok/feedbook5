  <title>The Cult and Science of Public Health: A Sociological Investigation - Kevin Dew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; 	In contemporary manifestations of public health rituals and events, people are being increasingly united around what they hold in common-their material being and humanity. As a cult of humanity, public health provides a moral force in society that replaces &#39;traditional&#39; religions in times of great diversity or heterogeneity of peoples, activities and desires. This is in contrast to public health&#39;s foundation in science, particularly the science of epidemiology. The rigid rules of &#39;scientific evidence&#39; used to determine the cause of illness and disease can work against the most vulnerable in society by putting sectors of the population, such as underrepresented workers, at a disadvantage. This study focuses on this tension between traditional science and the changing vision articulated within public health (and across many disciplines) that calls for a collective response to uncontrolled capitalism and unremitting globalization, and to the way in which health inequalities and their association with social inequalities provides a political rhetoric that calls for a new redistributive social programme. Drawing on decades of research, the author argues that public health is both a cult and a science of contemporary society.&lt;/p&gt;" />
