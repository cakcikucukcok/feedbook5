  <title>Complementary and Integrative Treatments in Psychiatric Practice - Patricia L. Gerbarg, Philip R. Muskin, Richard P. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;With its unrivaled scope, easy readability, and outstanding clinical relevance, Complementary and Integrative Treatments in Psychiatric Practice is an indispensable resource for psychiatric and other health care professionals. It is also well suited for individuals with mental disorders and their family members who are seeking updated, practical information on complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine (CAIM).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An international group of experts, researchers, and clinicians examines an expansive range of treatments that have been chosen on the basis of their therapeutic potential, strength of evidence, safety, clinical experience, geographic and cultural diversity, and public interest.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This guide offers advice on how to best tailor treatments to individual patient needs; combine and integrate treatments for optimal patient outcomes; identify high-quality products; administer appropriate doses; and deal with concerns about liability, safety, and herb-drug interactions. Treatments discussed include:  ? Nutrients and neutraceuticals? Plant-based medicines? Mind-body practices -- breathing techniques, yoga, qigong, tai chi, and meditation? Art therapy and equine therapy for children and adolescents ? Neurotherapy, neurostimulation, and other technologies &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Psychiatrists and other physicians, residents, fellows, medical students, psychologists, nurses, and other clinicians will benefit from guidelines for decision making, prioritizing, and combining CAIM treatments, as well as safely integrating CAIM with standard approaches.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That the treatments considered in this clinician&#39;s guide are applied to five of the major DSM-5 categories -- depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders, bipolar and related disorders, and schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders -- ensures its applicability, timeliness and timelessness.&lt;/P&gt;" />
