  <title>Dulcan&#39;s Textbook of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry - Mina K. Dulcan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Since publication of the first edition, Dulcan&#39;s Textbook of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has become the recognized standard in child and adolescent psychiatry textbooks. In this thoroughly revised second edition, the editor and chapter authors, leaders in the field of child and adolescent mental health, have again provided a complete, state-of-the-art textbook with notable updates and improvements that enhance accessibility and learning. The new edition is more concise and compact, while remaining comprehensive in scope. The number of chapters has been reduced to sharpen the book&#39;s focus on topics most relevant to clinical work. The textbook reflects the new DSM-5 classifications that all clinicians and trainees must know to function in today&#39;s health care environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Many other features contribute to the textbook&#39;s user-friendly design and broad appeal:  ?Chapters on the disorders (neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and those affecting somatic function) have a consistent structure of definition and clinical description, diagnosis, epidemiology, comorbidity, etiology and risk factors, prevention, course and prognosis, evaluation, and treatments, making it easy for readers to locate information and facilitating learning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;?The textbook is useful as both a core textbook for child and adolescent psychiatry fellowship training and a reference for a wide variety of health care professionals, including pediatricians, family physicians, general psychiatrists, child neurologists, psychologists, advanced practice nurses, and psychiatric social workers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;?The full range of psychosocial treatments is included, focusing on individuals, families, therapeutic milieus, and systemic models of care. The increasing emphasis on taking mental health care beyond the clinician&#39;s office is reflected in chapters on consultations related to schools and to primary care. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;?A section on specialized topics includes chapters on a range of critically important issues, including evidence-based practice, cultural and religious issues, legal and ethical issues, and telehealth.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;?Each chapter in the book ends with &quot;Summary Points,&quot; take-away messages that emphasize the most important concepts and promote consolidation of knowledge. ?The section &quot;Additional Resources&quot; includes &quot;Selected Books for Professionals&quot; and &quot;Web Sites for Professionals, Patients, and Families,&quot; which provide avenues for further study and connections with others treating or living with mental health issues. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Reflecting both the art and the science of this fascinating field, Dulcan&#39;s Textbook of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Second Edition, provides authoritative, practical guidance and is a resource that mental health practitioners at all levels of experience should have on their desks and handheld devices.&lt;/P&gt;" />
