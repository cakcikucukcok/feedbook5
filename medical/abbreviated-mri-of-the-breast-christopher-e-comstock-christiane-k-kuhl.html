  <title>Abbreviated MRI of the Breast - Christopher E. Comstock, Christiane K. Kuhl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Although mammography is the primary method used for breast cancer screening, screening mammography is limited especially in women with dense breasts, which includes nearly 50% of all women in the United States. Despite improvements such as digital mammography, computed aided detection, and digital breast tomosynthesis, breast cancer continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related death in women. The recent proliferation of screening breast ultrasound has led to increased health care costs and false positives, with only a slight improvement in breast cancer detection. It is time for a better test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first textbook dedicated to the subject of abbreviated breast MRI (AB-MR). The editors are principal investigators in the first multicenter trial evaluating AB-MR. Each chapter is authored by a leading expert in the field of breast MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AB-MR only takes 10 minutes or less to perform, has a comparable cost to screening breast ultrasound, and detects twice as many cancers compared to combined screening with mammography and ultrasound. The improved performance of AB-MR is irrespective of breast density, family history, overall breast cancer risk, and cancer characteristics (e.g. type, staging, invasive or intraductal, primary or recurrent). As such, it will likely become a routine screening tool in women with dense breasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A background on breast MR imaging including a review of current research data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fundamental guidelines for implementing, performing, and interpreting AB-MR&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technical approaches with proven efficacy, including biopsy methods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accurate interpretation presented in an easy-to-read flow chart format&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than 250 high quality color illustrations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;AB-MR has the potential to help radiologists overcome breast cancer screening limitations and change current standards of practice. This book provides radiologists with the necessary tools to quickly incorporate AB-MR into clinical practice, with an ultimate goal of improved breast cancer detection rates and patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
