  <title>Good Vibrations - Ken McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;I am an Evangelist, and in May 2005 my voice gave out.&amp;nbsp; After speaking on a Sunday morning, a lady came up to me after the service and said, &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t understand you.&amp;nbsp; I don&amp;rsquo;t know what you are saying.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; I was diagnosed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center by Dr. Clark Rosen and Dr. Jackie Gartner-Schmidt with Abductor Spasmodic Dysphonia.&amp;nbsp; I declined the Botox injections and began rehabilitation being instructed in the vocal exercises developed by Dr. Raymond Smolover known as Vocal Behavior Training.&amp;nbsp; Not a quick fix, but a real reversal of the paralyzing effects of SD, little by little my voice began to be restored.&amp;nbsp; For three years I went to therapy twice a week and worked the other days on my own doing the exercises.&amp;nbsp; I went from being able to barely make sound on eight notes on a piano to making sound on four octaves after three years of work.&amp;nbsp; I did not know if I would ever talk again.&amp;nbsp; (Most of the time I stayed in my bedroom.) Today I am back to public speaking and even singing, which I never even dreamed I would do again.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Vibrations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is my story of how I had my voice restored to functional use.&amp;nbsp; It is a step by step account of the exercises I did, and the fears I encountered.&amp;nbsp; It also contains email correspondence of two people who were diagnosed with SD and I instructed each of them in the exercises by email with their voices being improved.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is my desire that others who are suffering from SD can receive hope and help in overcoming SD.&amp;nbsp; Dr. J. Gartner-Schmidt states, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;most professionals believe that success in voice therapy is defined as a return to a functional level of voicing&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; Then according to this statement these exercises have been a success for me, for I have returned to a functional level of voicing, and that is from a public speaker, an evangelist, who at times is very hard on his voice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
