  <title>Introduction to Public Health in Pharmacy - Peter D. Hurd, Bruce Levin, Ardis Hanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pharmacists are on the frontlines of public health. Their public-facing roles uniquely position them to identify and address emerging disease challenges, discrepancies in health literacy, and barriers to treatment in the communities they serve. In today&#39;s interconnected world, the clients consulting a neighborhood pharmacist are just as likely to hail from across an ocean as they are from around the corner. Fittingly,&lt;em&gt; Introduction to Public Health in Pharmacy, Second Edition&lt;/em&gt; takes an approach that is both global and local. Macro-level examinations of health care systems and funding mechanisms around the world and advice for culturally competent, client-centered communication regarding nutrition and proper self-administration of medications encapsulate pharmacists&#39; dual roles as guardians of global public health and providers of personalized care.
Written in accordance with the latest guidelines from the Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education,&lt;em&gt; Introduction to Public Health in Pharmacy, Second Edition&lt;/em&gt; offers an accessible introduction for pharmacy students and a comprehensive refresher for pharmacists already in practice." />
