  <title>Arabs in Treatment: - Yana Korobko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I was only starting the therapeutic work with the Middle Eastern patients, I was looking for some kind of guidance to enable my genuine understanding of the Muslim patient cases. However, the material was scarce, haphazardly scattered, and mostly referring to the traditional therapies. That was not helpful and was even more confusing. With time, I managed to amass my own systemized data based on regular observations, practical cases, reflections, and exchanges with the colleagues. This material helped me to approach each case individually while respecting the cultural environment of a patient. Eventually, the book was published. This is the kind of book that I have always wanted to find, and I had to write it eventually by myself.
The work contains the systematized knowledge on the evolution of scientific psychology in the Islamic world, which starts with the prophetic times and continues until now. The book reveals the signifiers, which form a structure of a Muslim psyche. It also exposes the recurrent mental health complaints of the Arab patients and investigates their unconscious roots.  
The book is intended, first of all, for professionals who are directly related to the Muslim mental health-care system. Secondly, it is for anyone who is considering undergoing a personal analysis. And certainly, the edition is for everyone interested in the subject.  
This book does not intend to bring the answers. It rather continues the dialogue regarding the necessity of creating the psychological-counseling culture in the Muslim world." />
