  <title>Patient Care and Professionalism - Catherine D. DeAngelis, MD, MPH</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The chapters in Patient Care and Professionalism are ordered so that the main character in this book, the patient, has the first voice, followed by the ancient history of professionalism, the recent resurrection of professionalism in the United Kingdom (UK), and finally professionalism in the United States (US). The eleven chapters cover the various health care professions: medicine, nursing, public health, law, leadership, religion, and finally a chapter on the science of professionalism. The chapters are all written by internationally known experts.  The authors share their collective experience to shine light on professionalism from a new angle, revealing the way to a new kind of relationship for patients and physicians of the future-a rebirth of trust borne in real collaboration. The volume begins with a discussion of what is meant by the term advocacy in the practice of medicine, and then offers perspectives on where opportunities for medical advocacy lie, the rich collaborations they engender, and ways to overcome systemic barriers to advocacy." />
