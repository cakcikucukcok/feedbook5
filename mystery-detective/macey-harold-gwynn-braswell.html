  <title>Macey Harold - Gwynn Braswell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The stress of knowing that someone is trying to kill you and your ex-husband is nerve racking in itself.  But, when that someone is your ex-husbands wife, then another issue presents itself:  mainly staying alive
   Camilla was standing a couple feet from him with a gun trained at his chest Camilla what are you doing with that gun.  Put it away before someone gets hurt.  I cant do that Jason.  You destroyed me, destroyed my life and now you have to pay.
I am a good defense attorney.  No, I am a great defense attorney, but defending a guilty client is almost impossible.  The solution:  Let them convict themselves.
For now, I just played the loyal defense attorney, waiting for the right moment to pounce on him with my new evidence.  
Knowing who you are sometimes is not enough.  The tricky part is really learning who you are
  I marveled at the things in the Jakesville Museum that my great-grandmother Mamie and Aunt Tammy had started so many decades ago.  I never really saw them before today
Today is the first day of the rest of your life, came to mind.   My LifeHow true.  How very true." />
