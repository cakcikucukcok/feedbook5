  <title>Polished Off - Barbara Colley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There&#39;s a case of   spring-cleaning fever going around New Orleans&#39;s  historic Garden District,   and it&#39;s keeping Charlotte LaRue--proprietor  of Maid-for-a-Day--plenty busy.   Especially when what&#39;s supposed to be  a simple housecleaning job ends in a   grim discovery--and things start  to get real dirty real fast...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlotte has just about had it  with her sister Madeline. She&#39;s put up with   her simpering sibling&#39;s  selfish demands and snide comments for years, but   when Maddie turns on  her own son and his new bride, Charlotte&#39;s really   steamed. She thinks  Daniel and Nadia make a beautiful couple--and Nadia&#39;s   little boy is  just as cute as can be. And now that Nadia&#39;s abusive   ex-boyfriend  seems to be out of the picture--no one&#39;s seen the cad in   ages--the new  family&#39;s future looks as bright as a freshly Windex-ed   mirror.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But  years of polishing, scrubbing, and dusting have taught Charlotte that    it&#39;s only a matter of time before things get messy. Sure enough, when  she   pays a visit to a wealthy client&#39;s lavish mansion, an urn breaks  open--and   human bones spill out. A little snooping turns up a driver&#39;s  license   belonging to Nadia&#39;s no-good ex. Could the bones be his, too?  Before she   knows it, Charlotte&#39;s up to her elbows in the kind of  dirty business that   doesn&#39;t pay the bills...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Full of warm southern charm, this one&#39;s a good way to fight the   winter doldrums.&quot;&lt;br&gt; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Interesting characters and a suspenseful mystery combine for an   enjoyable and surprising novel.&quot;&lt;br&gt; --&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt;" />
