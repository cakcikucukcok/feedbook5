  <title>Bone Mountain - Eliot Pattison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Deep in the heart of Tibet, Shan Tao Yun, an exiled Chinese national and a former Beijing government Inspector, is caught between the brutal Chinese army and a Western oil company.  Shan has agreed to lead an expedition to return the eye of an idol, stolen almost a century ago and recently, clandestinely recovered, to a distant valley, an act that will fulfill an important Tibetan prophecy.  But the pilgrimage turns into a desperate flight when the monk who is to lead them is murdered.  Shan also discovers that the stone was stolen back from a brigade of the Chinese army that is now in hot pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still possessing an investigator&#39;s love of truth, Shan faces a perplexing tangle of mysteries.  Why are the Chinese so desperate to retrieve the stone eye, why has an American geologist abandoned the oil company&#39;s drilling project and fled into the mountains, and why are rumors sweeping the countryside that an ancient lama is returning to liberate this country?  As he digs into these questions, Shan realizes that there is more at stake than mere justice: the spiritual survival of his people is in danger as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complex and compelling, &lt;i&gt;Bone Mountain&lt;/i&gt; is a spectacular achievement from a major voice in crime fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
