  <title>All In - Harry Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Xlibris website book description
	Although the term All In is usually used when a poker player bets all of his chips, the author has very cleverly applied the term to the actions of PJ Gould, in his quest for revenge.
	All In, is a fast moving novel that takes the reader on an exciting journey from the Middle East, through the cocaine jungle of Columbia South America, then to Las Vegas and ends up in New York in the boardroom of one of the largest companies in the United States. It is the story of PJ Gould, the adopted son of a middle class Jewish family from Philadelphia.
	When he learns he has a twin brother, Walter, who has been raised by the Lippincotts, one of the countries richest families in America, he realizes but for the luck of the draw, their situations could have been reversed.
	Although Walter Lippincott invites his twin brother to join him in the family business, PJ chooses instead to visit Israel after graduating from college. It is there he discovers his Judaism, and enlists in the Sayeret Matkal, Israels elite and most celebrated commando unit. The Sayeret Matkal is comparable to the US militarys Delta Force and is responsible for some of Israels high profile security missions. They also conduct highly sensitive assassinations, sabotage, and psychological warfare projects. PJ became an expert in all of these. He earned the reputation of the best in the business, and after leaving the Sayeret Matkal, he was recruited  by the CIA.
	After fifteen years of performing political assassinations, he finally reached a point when he no longer wished to continue in the killing business. That was when he retired and moved to Las Vegas ,where he became a high stakes poker player. He played the game of poker the same way he lived his life. When he attempted to do something, he was all in. He never did anything half hearted. In poker, all in means you could be betting  all of your money on the turn of a card. When he played this way, sometimes he won with the best hand. Other times he would win by bluffing the other players.
	After his twin brother and girlfriend are murdered gangland style, PJ vows revenge. Then when the Las Vegas police department warns him not to get involved, he explains to them that he intends to goAll In. There is no way they can prevent him from taking revenge. In life like in poker, sometime, you have to go ..all in.
	The story takes the reader on a roller coaster ride from Las Vegas to New York, and from there to Chicago and back. You will meet Anita, his brothers widow, Joey Sconsi a would be wise guy, and Joseph Cantelli, an old world Mafia Don. You will be introduced to Tozzi, the hit man, and Sid Mastro, the unlucky ex-con who finds himself in the middle of an ill conceived murder plot.
	The characters will jump off the page and keep you wondering what will happen next. All In is a must read." />
