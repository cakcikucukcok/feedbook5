  <title>Nicholas Goade, Detective - E. Phillips Oppenheim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="E. Phillips Oppenheim was a popular 20th century writer best known for penning suspenseful thriller novels like „The Mystery of Mr. Bernard Brown”. Many of his more than 100 novels are still read today. His novels and short stories have all the elements of blood-racing adventure and intrigue and are precursors of modern-day spy fictions. „Nicholas Goade, Detective” is a collection of short mysteries about a Scotland Yard detective on holiday. As he travels across England with his dog in his old car, he keeps stumbling across little mysteries. It’s a cross between a classic police procedural and a 1930s update of Sherlock Holmes, with Goade solving odd cases through a combination of careful detective work, leaps of intuition, and his ability to understand and communicate with people." />
