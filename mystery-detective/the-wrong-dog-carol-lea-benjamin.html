  <title>The Wrong Dog - Carol Lea Benjamin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From former detective turned noted author and dog trainer, Carol Lea Benjamin, comes the fifth book in the critically-lauded Rachel Alexander mystery series, for the first time in mass market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophie Gordon didn&#39;t let her epilepsy get in the way of her life as a teacher of deaf children. But without her trusty canine companion, an indispensable service dog named Blanche, she wouldn&#39;t be nearly as well-off. A service dog that can perform the difficult tasks that epilepsy requires--sensing when a seizure is about to occur and fetching life-saving medication--is extremely rare, so when a veterinarian&#39;s office promises that they can clone Blanche, Sophie jumps at the opportunity. Her former worries can now be put to rest, knowing that now she&#39;ll have a replacement for Blanche when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the puppy they provided didn&#39;t have what it takes to be a service dog, and when Sophie visits the vet to alert them of the problem, none of the staff is anywhere to be found--they&#39;ve disappeared without a trace. To get to the bottom of this clone-by-night operation, Sophie hires P.I. Rachel Alexander and Dash, her pit bull partner. And two days after meeting with Rachel, Sophie is found dead, apparently of a seizure, but it didn&#39;t take Dash&#39;s sensitive nose to tell that something doesn&#39;t smell right, and that the missing vets definitely need further examination.&lt;/p&gt;" />
