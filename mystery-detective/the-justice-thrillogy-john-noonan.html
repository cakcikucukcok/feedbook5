  <title>The Justice Thrillogy - John Noonan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the first time the Justice thrillogy is published as one volume.
STREET JUSTICE
Veteran Garda Detective Brown finds himself caught in the middle of a deadly game of cat and mouse between gun-wielding vigilantes and Dublins drug gangs. Someone is dealing out deadly justice to drug dealers, and Brown must stop them before another corpse turns up. Can he trust Macker, his petty criminal tout? Is he telling Brown all he knows? Have antidrug activists, Billy and Mary ONeill, really turned their backs on violence? When a criminal kingpin comes out of hiding, things really heat up. Just when Brown plans to draw the net over drug dealers and vigilantes alike, the tables are turned with deadly consequences. 
NEVER ENDING JUSTICE
Sergeant Brown stirs up a hornets nest when he makes public information that shows the unsavory connections between drug dealing, business, and politics. The Garda is getting too hot for him, so he contemplates retirement. He and his wife go to Spain to check out an apartment. Macker is already there. On the face of it settled down with a legitimate job and girlfriend, he is making a name for himself as a ruthless assassin for the ex-pat Irish and Russian mobs. He hates Brown and knows hes in town. Whos next for rough justice? 
FINAL JUSTICE
Retired Garda Brown and his wife have a new life in Spain. Hes a consultant with an Irish company building holiday homes. Little does he know that its the front for Terry, an Irish criminal. A web of intrigue is being woven around Brown by the Irish and Russian gangs, and not-so-naive Rene, Mackers girlfriend, is pulling the strings. Will Brown cop on before it is too late? Things come to a head in an explosive finale that will leave you rocking." />
