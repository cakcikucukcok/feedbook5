  <title>Nantucket Drowning: A Novel - John O&#39;Shea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A hurricane roars up, headed straight for Nantucket Island. That&#39;s where James O&#39;Neill, struggling hedge fund manager, is trying to put his life back together. Luckily, before the storm strikes, James is able to get his 12 son Danny on the last outward-bound ferry-but he can&#39;t find his aging father. As the hurricane ravages the island, James searches for his elderly dad. He encounters mysterious men throughout the quaint town. After he spots two of them cruising offshore in his friend&#39;s boat, he gives chase along the north shore. When they seize the island&#39;s airport, James intercedes and realizes he is up against a foreign threat on American soil. He races across Nantucket to stop the remaining crew before they execute their plans, the effects of which could devastate the entire coast. Meanwhile, an explosion has ripped apart Danny&#39;s ship and strands the young boy amid the raging seas. James is forced to make impossible choices between saving his family and intercepting terrorists before time runs out." />
