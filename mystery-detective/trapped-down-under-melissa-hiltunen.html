  <title>Trapped Down Under - Melissa Hiltunen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mrs. Remington is living the dream. 
Shes been invited to go on a book-signing tour in Australia, and she and her husband, Kris, are both excited to finally get the chance to take their long-overdue honeymoon. But on their first night there, what started as a fantasy quickly spins into the realm of nightmare.
She awakes to find not her husband but a note in his place: 
If anyone else knows about this, your husband will die. 
Terrified and out of her depth, she follows the kidnappers instructions to the letter. Shes lost in a strange land where she knows no one, doesnt understand the culture, and is removed from everything she might know about dealing with the criminals who now hold her life and future hostage. 
To survive and secure her husbands return, shell have to use all her strength and endurance to overcome obstacles that appear impossible. She needs to dig deeper than shes even known to rise above the fear that threatens to paralyze her. Tormented by too many questions, shes stripped of her confidence to solve any problem. 
All she knows is that an evil man stands between her and everything she wants. Shes quickly pulled into a terrifying and thrilling journey, not just in the physical world but in the realms of the mind.
She never imagined that her husband would become a statisticor that she would be the one to save him." />
