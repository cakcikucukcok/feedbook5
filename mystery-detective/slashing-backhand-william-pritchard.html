  <title>Slashing Backhand - William Pritchard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three cargo containers filled with weaponry are unloaded in the Los Angeles Basin Harbor.  A Host of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearm agents are summoned to seize and secure the shipment and bring the smugglers to justice.	
	In San Francisco, Hugh Horner is hired to protect a frightened ex-tennis player, Sylvia Defoe, blaming her ex-husband, Brad Gillmore for stalking and harassing her.  He is brutally murdered by a mysterious butcher, and Sylvia is the accused.
	Horner sets out to find the killer.  He encounters a host of suspects, two murderous partners of the Gillmore Shipping gang, an erotic stripper, a pawnbroker, and a tempting redhead who was one in a long list of the dead mans lovers.	
	During his investigation, Hugh is beaten, shot, knifed, chased through the streets of San Francisco, and falls for the beguiling Sylvia.  To make matters worse a professional killer from Chicago is hired to end Horners life.
	The disgruntled Hugh feels he should chuck the case and get back to a more secure existence.  Hugh calls in a trusted friend to help in the battle.  Both discover the mobs strategy and set out to foil their plans.
	The story takes another twist as Sylvia lures Hugh to Puerto Vallarta on a much-needed holiday at her wealthy parents, isolated villa.  Unaware theyve been followed, Hugh and Sylvia settle into a peaceful way of life, parading as lovers.  But fate is their Master.
	This compelling thriller is a must-read whodunit, and the spine tingling ending will straighten the neck hair of booklovers everywhere!" />
