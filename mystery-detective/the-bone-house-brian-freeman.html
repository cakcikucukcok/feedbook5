  <title>The Bone House - Brian Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A spine-tingling stand-alone thriller of psychological suspense from Edgar-nominated author Brian Freeman, &lt;i&gt;The Bone House&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hilary and Mark Bradley are trapped in a web of suspicion. Last year, accusations of a torrid affair with a student cost Mark his teaching job and made the young couple into outcasts in their remote island town off the Lake Michigan coast. Now another teenage girl is found dead on a deserted beach. . . and once again, Mark faces a hostile town convinced of his guilt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hilary Bradley is determined to prove that Mark is innocent, but she&#39;s on a lonely, dangerous quest. Even when she discovers that the murdered girl was witness to a horrific crime years earlier, the police are certain she&#39;s throwing up a smoke screen to protect her husband. Only a quirky detective named Cab Bolton seems willing to believe Hilary&#39;s story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hilary and Cab soon find that people in this community are willing to kill to keep their secrets hidden--and to make sure Mark doesn&#39;t get away with murder. And with each shocking revelation, even Hilary begins to wonder whether her husband is truly innocent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
