  <title>Treacherous Obsession - Kenneth A. Studstill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The good life for Kevin Charles, an attorney in the small town of East Bay, Florida, mysteriously ends after his client, Victoria Roberts, discharges him from a multi-million dollar law suit. His slide down the slippery slope to personal and professional oblivion begins when Victoria files a bar grievance falsely accusing him of unconsensual sex. Why would Victoria do this? Has she lied for some nefarious reason? Or is she acting under duress? He feels someone else must be involved, but who and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Kevin finally learns it is one of his so-called friends, who, has embarked on a plan to exclude him as one of the attorneys chosen to sue the tobacco companies, he does not just get even, he wreaks revenge through nerve wrenching chicanery, that paradoxically leaves him close to Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He feels vindicated, but is he? Unsure about himself and his life, he leaves his hometown to travel indefinitely through Europe, only to be drawn back to East Bay after a few months. But will he ever have back what he has lost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Studstill has created a fascinating mystery of unvarnished greed and corruption outside and inside the halls of government with an actual event as the backdrop in this engaging and perceptive novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
