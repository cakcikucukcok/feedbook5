  <title>On Copper Street - Chris Nickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Detective Inspector Tom Harper finds answers hard to come by in his latest, most challenging, investigation to date.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Leeds, England. March, 1895. The day after his release from prison, petty criminal Henry White is found stabbed to death at his terraced home on Copper Street. Pursuing enquiries in a neighbourhood where people are suspicious of strangers and hostile to the police, DI Tom Harper and his team find the investigation hard going. If anyone knows anything about Henry White’s murder – or the robbery that landed him in gaol in the first place – they are unable or unwilling to say. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt; At the same time, acid is thrown over a young boy in a local bakery in a seemingly unprovoked attack. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Praying for a breakthrough, Harper knows that he must uncover the motive in each case if he is to have any chance of catching the culprits. Of one thing he is certain: if he doesn’t find answers soon, more deaths will follow." />
