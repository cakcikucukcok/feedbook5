  <title>Love, Lies and Liquor - M. C. Beaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love, Lies and Liquor &lt;/i&gt;continues the tradition in M. C. Beaton&#39;s beloved Agatha Raisin mystery series--now a hit show on Acorn TV and public television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agatha Raisin is lonely. Busy as she is with her detective agency and the meetings of the Carsely Ladies&#39; Society, she still misses her ex-husband, James Lacey, so she welcomes his return to the cottage next door with her usual triumph of optimism over experience---especially when he invites her on holiday at a surprise location that was once very dear to him. With visions of a romantic hideaway in Italy or the Pacific dancing in her head, Agatha goes off happily with James to...Snoth-on-Sea, in Sussex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While James may have fond memories of boyhood holidays there, Snoth-on-Sea has seen better days, as has the once-grand Palace Hotel, now run-down and tacky and freezing cold. Nor do the other guests have much to recommend them, especially the brassy honeymoon couple, Mr. and Mrs. Jankers, who pick a fight with Agatha in the dining room. But trouble has a way of following Agatha even if romance does not: Just as she and James are preparing to flee to warmer climes, Geraldine Jankers is found dead on the beach--strangled with Agatha&#39;s scarf. So much for Agatha&#39;s holiday fantasies: Not only is it time to put her detective skills to work, but the police are not even sure that she&#39;ll be allowed to leave town.&lt;/p&gt;" />
