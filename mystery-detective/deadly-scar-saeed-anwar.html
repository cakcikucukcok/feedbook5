  <title>Deadly Scar - Saeed Anwar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The novel opens with great pace and vitality with a murder almost on the opening page and the action never flags from this point onwards, with dramatic incide,
The whole book is dramatic, utterly compelling work. The author wastes no time at all in drawing the reader into the open, exiting and often dangerous world of murder and suspence without pause for breath, making this work a genuine page turner and, ultimately, a book which is very hard to put down. 
DEADLY SCAR is an exhilarating book in many ways. Not only does the reader travel with Darren and Adrian on their adventures, experiencing all they experience, but there is also the opportunity to share their thoughts and feelings, to understand what they think, and why they think it, and, more importantly, why they act the way they do. In this way we get a rare insight into how to fathom the criminal mind.
Of great importance in this book is the relationship between these two quite different protagonists. What is also striking and essential ingredient in any work which is going to be published and, most importantly, sold to the relevant reading audience is extremely impressive opening which the author not following dramatic incident in rapid succession, all interspread with Adrian&#39;s love interest and a brief snap shot of his past personal life................" />
