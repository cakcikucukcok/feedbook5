      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paw Enforcement &lt;/i&gt;introduces police officer Megan Luz and her loyal K-9 partner Brigit-two Fort Worth cops who are worth their weight in kibble.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHE&#39;S ON A SHORT LEASH.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Officer Luz is lucky she still has a job after tasering a male colleague where it counts the most. Sure, he had it coming-which is why the police chief is giving Megan a second chance. The catch? Her new partner can&#39;t carry a gun, can&#39;t drive a cruiser, and can&#39;t recite the Miranda Rights. Because her new partner is a big furry police dog. So &lt;i&gt;that&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; what the chief meant when he called Megan&#39;s partner a real b*tch...&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;WILL FATE THROW HER A BONE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Brigit out on the beat, Megan is writing up enough tickets to wallpaper the whole station. But when a bomb goes off at the mall&#39;s food court, it&#39;s up to Megan and Brigit to start digging-and sniffing-for clues. With the help of dead-sexy bomb-squad expert Seth Rutledge and his own canine partner named Blast, Megan finds herself in a desperate race to collar a killer. Will justice be served-or will she end up in the doghouse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Readers should be prepared for a laugh fest. Diane Kelly is first class.&quot;-&lt;i&gt;Night Owl Romance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
