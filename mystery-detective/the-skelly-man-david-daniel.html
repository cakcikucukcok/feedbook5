  <title>The Skelly Man - David Daniel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amiable, wisecracking Alex Rasmussen was first introduced--to great acclaim--in &lt;i&gt;The Heaven Stone, &lt;/i&gt;which won the PWA/St. Martin&#39;s Best First Private Eye Novel Contest, and was also named one of the best mysteries of the year by the &lt;i&gt;Providence Journal-Bulletin. &lt;/i&gt;Now ghosts from the past and a murderous Halloween haunt his second case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former cop gone private, Rasmussen makes a living in the decaying New England mill town of Lowell, Massachusetts. Lowell is also the hometown of &lt;i&gt;Good Night Show &lt;/i&gt;host Jerry Corbin, whose career has started to slump in recent years. Corbin and his entourage have come to town to film the pilot episode for  a new series designed to boost his sagging star quotient and rescue his ratings. Unfortunately, someone&#39;s been sending Corbin hate mail, and an off-the-record investigation is in order. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Rasmussen, whose familiarity with TV consists of whatever&#39;s on the set in his local bar between sporting events. He&#39;s game for the job, though, and soon finds himself one of the insiders in Corbin&#39;s camp. Digging into Corbin&#39;s life to find out who wants to destroy him, Rasmussen learns that there are old secrets someone wants kept and old grudges someone wants satisfied. Corbin may have been on the fringes of these events, but now he has become the prime target.&lt;/p&gt;" />
