  <title>Bundle of Joy - Nadia Thornton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To her friends and family, Joy Wildman-McInnis had it all: a handsome, ambitious husband, a fulfilling career, loving friends and family and a beautiful home in the suburbs of Ottawa. In public, Joy works tirelessly to maintain the faade of the happy suburbanite, but in private, she is miserable. 
Her friends have all moved on in their relationships, but Joy feels that her marriage to James has stagnated. To make matters worse, she knows that he is less than truthful about his habits. She yearns to start a family, but the convoluted circumstances of her life have all but killed that dream. With her biological clock ticking, she must now find the strength to put on another brave face as societal pressure builds around her. 
As her desires and her worries threaten to consume her, Joy finds herself caught on a roller coaster of emotions, fears and despair. To Joy, the worst thing about being lied to is knowing that shes not worth the truth.
She knows that something must changebut wonders if she is strong enough to make the biggest decision of her life. Just how much is she willing to sacrifice to regain her dignity, her true happiness and her dreams of motherhood?" />
