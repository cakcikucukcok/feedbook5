  <title>Murder at the 42nd Street Library - Con Lehane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This first book in an irresistible new series introduces librarian and reluctant sleuth Raymond Ambler, a doggedly curious fellow who uncovers murderous secrets hidden behind the majestic marble façade of New York City&#39;s landmark 42nd Street Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Murder at the 42nd Street Library&lt;/i&gt; follows Ambler and his partners in crime-solving as they track down a killer, shining a light on the dark deeds and secret relationships that are hidden deep inside the famous flagship building at the corner of 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their search for the reasons behind the murder, Ambler and his crew uncover sinister, and profoundly disturbing, relationships among the scholars studying in the iconic library. Included among the players are a celebrated mystery writer who has donated his papers to the library&#39;s crime fiction collection; that writer&#39;s long-missing daughter, a prominent New York society woman with a hidden past, and more than one of Ambler&#39;s colleagues at the library. Shocking revelations lead inexorably to the traumatic events that follow--the reading room will never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;" />
