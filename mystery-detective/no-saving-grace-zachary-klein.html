  <title>No Saving Grace - Zachary Klein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;When I had things to believe in,&amp;#8221; he thinks, &amp;#147;they usually broke my heart.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Matt Jacob has seen his share of life&#39;s darker side as a social worker -- and more than his share of its underside as a private eye in the less-than-blueblood districts of Boston. He watches too much late-night TV, smokes too many cigarettes, and thinks too much for his own good. Sometimes high, often down, but never out, Matt Jacob is a survivor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Maybe that&#39;s what draws him to his latest assignment -- penetrating the fiercely private world of an embattled Hasidic Jewish sect. In the midst of a holy celebration, a powerful and beloved rabbi is gunned down by the ringleader of a white supremacist hate group -- who in turn is shot dead by another rabbi. To help attorney and friend Simon Roth defend the volatile Rabbi Yonah Saperstein, Matt agrees to ferret out the first-hand facts in the double slaying.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Amid the Hasidim, Matt finds a people with a rage to survive. Among the White Avengers, he finds only rage. Though the battle lines are clearly drawn, Matt&#39;s moral compass detects a blurring of the lines between good and evil, right and wrong, justice and vigilantism,&lt;/div&gt;" />
