  <title>Cockatiels at Seven - Donna Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s time for more outrageous and feathered fun in the award-winning, laugh-out-loud Meg Langslow series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her old friend Karen drops by with two-year-old son Timmy, Meg Langslow reluctantly agrees to babysit &quot;just for a little while.&quot; But when nightfall comes, the toddler is still in residence and Karen isn&#39;t answering any phone calls. Meg decides she must find out what&#39;s happening, so the next morning, with Timmy in tow, she retraces her friend&#39;s footsteps---and begins to suspect that Karen&#39;s disappearance is tied to at least one serious crime. Has Karen been killed or kidnapped? Is she on the run from the bad guys? Or is &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; one of the bad guys? The police don&#39;t seem to care, so Meg once again plays sleuth---this time with a toddler as her sidekick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As usual, Meg&#39;s extended family adds to the complications in her life. What covert animal welfare project are Dad and the curmudgeonly zoologist Dr. Montgomery Blake working on---and will Meg have to make another late-night trip to bail them out of jail? Why does Meg&#39;s brother keep disappearing---is he merely trying to avoid babysitting, or is he involved in something more mysterious? Will taking care of Timmy dampen newly married Meg and Michael&#39;s enthusiasm for starting a family of their own? And are any of Meg&#39;s relatives reliable enough to be trusted with a two-year-old---especially a two-year-old whose whereabouts might be of interest to some very dangerous people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donna Andrews once again proves her skill as one of the funniest, most entertaining mystery authors around.&lt;/p&gt;" />
