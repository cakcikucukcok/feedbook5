  <title>York Street - Jan Walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story left me ready for more adventures with all the characters. I look forward to the next book from this author!  
- Kelly Stuhr, Senior Des Moines Police Officer
Walters plot is replete with a colorful cast, a combination of foils and a tight handful of antagonists. Unique to Walters third person narrative is the way she weaves in comedy and a bit of romance in the midst of a dark plot. 
- Anita Lock, Pacific Book Review
Brett OShea is a young street cop in Des Moines trying to make detective. He works by the book and doesnt believe in hocus pocus. Until a ghost named, Al, visits Brett claiming that hes been sent to help Brett solve a series of murders, including the 1933 murder of Bretts great-grandfather, who was also a detective. The mischievous Al appears to be more of a pain than help for Brett. The pair quickly discover that the killer has supernatural abilities and their investigation takes off on a supernatural rollercoaster. Bretts problems mount when an attractive female reporter suspects that Brett is hiding something and begins her own investigation. Brett and Al must figure out how to work together in order to catch the killer before loved ones die." />
