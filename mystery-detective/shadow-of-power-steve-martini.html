  <title>Shadow of Power - Steve Martini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court is one of our most sacred&amp;#8212;and secretive&amp;#8212;public institutions. But sometimes secrets can lead to cover-ups with very deadly consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terry Scarborough is a legal scholar and provocateur who craves headline-making celebrity, but with his latest book he may have gone too far. In it he resurrects forgotten language in the U.S. Constitution&amp;#8212;and hints at a missing letter of Thomas Jefferson&#39;s&amp;#8212;that threatens to divide the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, during a publicity tour, Scarborough is brutally murdered in a San Diego hotel room, and a young man with dark connections is charged. What looks like an open-and-shut case to most people doesn&#39;t to defense attorney Paul Madriani. He believes that there is much more to the case and that the defendant is a pawn caught in the middle, being scapegoated by circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the trial spirals toward its conclusion, Madriani and his partner, Harry Hinds, race to find the missing Jefferson letter&amp;#8212;and the secrets it holds about slavery and scandal at the time of our nation&#39;s founding and the very reason Scarborough was killed. Madriani&#39;s chase takes him from the tension-filled courtroom in California to the trail of a high court justice now suddenly in hiding and lays bare the soaring political stakes for a seat on the highest court, in a country divided, and under the shadow of power.&lt;/p&gt;" />
