  <title>Blacksparrow - Thomas Alan Ebelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In July of 1935, the mangled, partially devoured bodies of an old Navajo and his granddaughter are found on a reservation in New Mexico. As rumors circulate that both victims were eaten by an animal, a federal Indian officer begins his investigation.   Sam Begay suspects the clues point to Ye&#39;iitsoh, a mythical monster from ancient tribal legends. No one believes him except Dan Yazzie, the girl&#39;s ex-convict father. Driven by his compassion for the grief-stricken man, Sam helps him prepare to destroy the animal and avenge the deaths. As Dan begins his hunt, Sam uncovers more missing persons. Although there are no other reports of killings, Sam&#39;s Navajo upbringing tells him that all things are connected. As a clandestine operation continues in a nearby mine, only time will tell if he is right.   In this gripping thriller, a tenacious investigator is in a race against time to stop the killings as a bloodthirsty monster lurks in the shadows of the Navajo Reservation and a secret mission unfolds." />
