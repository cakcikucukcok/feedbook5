  <title>Grievous Bodily Harm - Jane Bennett Munro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Idaho pathologist Toni Day meets Perrine Memorial Hospitals new administrator, she immediately notices that his smile does not reach his blue eyes. There is no question in her mind that Marcus Manning is trouble.
Manning, a good old boy with roots in Twin Falls, does not waste any time earning the enmity of medical staff and employees alike as he ruthlessly goes about eliminating anyone who might oppose him in his quest to become CEO not just of Perrine Memorial but of the entire system. Unwisely, he starts his battle with Day, who blows the whistle on his twisted campaign of lies, blackmail, and sexual abuse until the medical staff finally considers firing him. But when someone comes up with a more permanent solution, Toni becomes one of the prime suspects. While attempting to solve the mystery of Marcuss murder to keep herself out of jail, she delves into the private lives of those close to him, where she soon finds herself forced to do the unthinkable in order to save her life and finally learn the truth.
In this mystery thriller, an Idaho pathologist is once again propelled down a dangerous path after a new hospital administrator unleashes a callous plan and she is accused of his murder.
 A roller-coaster ride of suspense and intrigue
