  <title>A Stranger in Mayfair - Charles Finch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Returning from a continental honeymoon with his lifelong friend and new wife, Lady Jane Grey, Charles Lenox is asked by a colleague in Parliament to consult in the murder of a footman, bludgeoned to death with a brick. His investigation uncovers both unsettling facts about the family he served and a strange, second identity that the footman himself cultivated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going into the boxing clubs and public houses, the Mayfair mansions and servants&#39; quarter of Victorian London, Lenox gradually realizes that an old friend may be implicated in the footman&#39;s death. Soon a suspect is arrested, but Lenox has his doubts. Desperately trying to balance the opening of Parliament and what he feels sure is a dark secret, he soon discovers that the killer is someone shockingly innocuous--who may be prepared to spill blood again, even a detective&#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Detective Lenox, Lady Grey, and their circle of close associates, Charles Finch has created a cast of inviting, flesh-andblood characters. His evolving series, with its keen eye for period detail and razor-sharp plotting, offers readers an unparalleled brand of charm, sophistication, and suspense.&lt;/p&gt;" />
