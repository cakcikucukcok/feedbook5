  <title>Personal War Part 3 - Dave Aquino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It looks like William Defreno&#39;s finally made it. He has a home, his friends, a girl, and has transformed himself into a successful business owner. Having put his infamous past behind him, William now looks forward to quieter days and enjoying the fruits of his hard work. &lt;br&gt;But when a dispute over his old track record threatens his business and a con man moves in on his family, William suddenly finds everything he&#39;s worked so hard for starting to unravel. Instead of enjoying his well earned peace, he soon finds himself fighting his hardest battles yet. &lt;br&gt;As the bitter fight continues, the business suffers and William&#39;s new respectable image is damaged. Old friends grow distant and the people he loves begin to seem like strangers.  &lt;br&gt;Soon it becomes clear that the harder he fights to hold on to his new life the closer it comes to slipping away.  &lt;br&gt;Can William survive his third Personal War? Or will one bad night send him into a downward spiral that he can&#39;t pull out of?  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dave Aquino is the author of several novels, including &lt;i&gt;Personal War, Personal War Part 2, Personal War Part 3, Counselor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Slot Machine&lt;/i&gt;.
