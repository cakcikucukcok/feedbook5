  <title>Death of the Queen of Hearts - Roman A. Clay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The royal family had plans for Prince Jamess twenty-first birthday, but so did James, and they didnt include the royal family. On the night of his big celebration, he ducks his royal bodyguards to party with friends, but his plans are sidetracked by a gift given to him, a mysterious letter, addressed to Bunny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunny was a nickname only his mother used to call him. But his mother, Princess Christina, died four years earlier in a suspicious car crash, and conspiracy theories still circulate. James follows the note to the St. Laurent Restaurant, where a stranger leaves him a DVD with shocking information about his mothers death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So begins Jamess perilous journey to uncover the truth about his mothers untimely demise, but there are those who would stand in his way. Will James find out what happened to Princess Christina and take his place on the throne or will he be doomed to following in his mothers fatal footsteps?&lt;/p&gt;" />
