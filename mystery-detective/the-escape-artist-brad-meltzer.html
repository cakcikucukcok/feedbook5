      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Nola Brown, the U.S. Army&#39;s artist-in-residence--a painter and trained soldier--sees something nobody was supposed to see and earns a dangerous enemy in this novel as powerful as &quot;a launched torpedo slashing through 400 pages of deep water before reaching impact...one of the best thrill rides ever&quot; (David Baldacci).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Who is Nola Brown?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Nola is a mystery&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Nola is trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  And Nola is supposed to be dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Her body was found on a plane that mysteriously fell from the sky as it left a secret military base in the Alaskan wilderness. Her commanding officer verifies she&#39;s dead. The US government confirms it. But Jim &quot;Zig&quot; Zigarowski has just found out the truth: Nola is still alive. And on the run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Zig works at Dover Air Force Base, helping put to rest the bodies of those who die on top-secret missions. Nola was a childhood friend of Zig&#39;s daughter and someone who once saved his daughter&#39;s life. So when Zig realizes Nola is still alive, he&#39;s determined to find her. Yet as Zig digs into Nola&#39;s past, he learns that trouble follows Nola everywhere she goes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Together, Nola and Zig will either reveal a sleight of hand being played at the highest levels of power or die trying to uncover the US Army&#39;s most mysterious secret--a centuries-old conspiracy that traces back through history to the greatest escape artist of all: Harry Houdini.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Meltzer is a master and this is his best. Not since &lt;i&gt;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&lt;/i&gt; have you seen a character like this. Get ready to meet Nola. If you&#39;ve never tried Meltzer, this is the one.&quot; -- Harlan Coben" />
