  <title>Edward Trencom&#39;s Nose - Giles Milton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Situated on London&#39;s Foster Lane, there is a quintessentially Georgian, redbrick house with a green door bearing the sign trencoms, 1662.  It&#39;s the home of the Trencom family&#39;s cheese store, a generational establishment begun by Humphrey Trencom that now, 303 years later, is run by Edward Trencom.  Quaint though it may seem, it bears witness to a strange occurrence of &quot;accidents&quot; that seem to befall every generation of the curd-loving family....&lt;br&gt;            Edward Trencom has bumbled through life, relying on his trusty nose to turn the family cheese shop into the most celebrated &lt;i&gt;fromagerie&lt;/i&gt; in England.  This was no ordinary nose, but one long, aquiline, and furnishing the trademark circular bump over the bridge---the very same nose bestowed on all the Trencom men.  It was extraordinary, able to discern the composition, maturity, and quality of cheese---and the Trencom noses had sniffed, whiffed, and judged the very best cheeses of the world.&lt;br&gt;            But on an ordinary day, Edward&#39;s world is turned upside down when he stumbles across a crate of family papers. To his horror, he discovers that nine previous generations of his family have come to sticky ends because of their noses.  When he investigates---despite his grandfather&#39;s caveat never to look into the origin of his nose---Edward finds himself caught up in a Byzantine riddle to which there is no obvious answer.  And like his ill-fated ancestors, he is hunted down by rival forces whose identity and purpose remain a total mystery.&lt;br&gt;            Trapped between the mad, the bad, and a cheese to die for, Edward Trencom&#39;s nose must make a choice---and for the last nine generations it has made the catastrophically wrong decision.&lt;br&gt;            Giles Milton&#39;s deliciously comic debut novel is a mouthwatering blend of Tom Sharpe and P. G. Wodehouse.  From the noble Roquefort to the piquant &lt;i&gt;Èpoisses,&lt;/i&gt; every page is permeated by the pungent odor of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for Giles Milton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He has a rare ability---a talent for sifting fine pearls from faraway sands and for transmuting the merely arcane into little literary gems.&quot;&lt;br&gt;---Simon Winchester, &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Boston Globe &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Milton spins a fascinating tale. . . .
