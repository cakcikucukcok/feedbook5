  <title>Highway 61 - David Housewright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mac McKenzie returns with a too-personal case that leads him up the legendary Highway 61 in the latest in David Housewright&#39;s awardwinning series&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rushmore McKenzie is a former cop, current millionaire, and an occasional unlicensed P.I. who does favors for friends. Yet he has reservations when his girlfriend&#39;s daughter asks him to help her father Jason Truhler, the ex-husband of McKenzie&#39;s girlfriend, and a man in serious trouble. En route from St. Paul to a Canadian blues festival on Highway 61, he met a girl, blacked out, and awoke hours later in a strange motel, with the girl&#39;s murdered body on the floor. Slipping away unnoticed and heading home, he thought he&#39;d got away--until he started getting texts with photos of the body and demands for blackmail payments he couldn&#39;t pay. &lt;br&gt;McKenzie soon finds that Truhler was set up in a modified honey trap, designed to blackmail him. But Truhler&#39;s version wasn&#39;t exactly the truth either. And McKenzie now finds himself trapped in the middle of a very dangerous game with some of the most powerful men in the state on one side and some of the deadliest on the other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
