      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Out here, in the quaint ceaseless calm of an English vil­lage, it is  hard to imagine a life beyond. From the outside, everything seems to  make sense. Everything has its place. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;My friends are open and  unsuspecting. There is none of the natural suspicion of the  Argentinian. . . For me, it&#39;s unbeliev­able in a way.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two  decades after being forced to leave his native Argentina, Detective  Chief Inspector Guillermo Downes has sought tranquility in the orderly  life of the English Cotswolds. But violence can strike just as suddenly  in the countryside as it can in Buenos Aires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body of  wealthy landowner Frank Hurst is found with a pitchfork through his  neck, it brings back disturbing memories of former mysteries. Hurst&#39;s  wife drowned in their swimming pool-an official accident, though many  villagers have their doubts. And what about the two young girls who were  abducted years before, with some possible links to Hurst that were  never proven?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;It&#39;s something truly terrible to make someone  disap­pear,&#39;&#39; Downes tells his partner.
