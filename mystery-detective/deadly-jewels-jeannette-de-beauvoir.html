  <title>Deadly Jewels - Jeannette de Beauvoir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Martine LeDuc, publicity director for the city of Montréal, is summoned into the mayor&#39;s office, she&#39;s pleasantly surprised to find the city is due for a PR coup: a doctoral researcher at McGill University claims to have found proof that the British crown jewels were stored in Montréal during WWII.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martine is thrilled to be part of the excavation project, until it turns out that the dig&#39;s discoveries include the skeleton of a man with diamonds in his ribcage and a hole in his skull. Is this decades-old murder leading her too far into the dangerous world of Canada&#39;s neo-Nazi networks, or is there something going on that makes the jewels themselves deadly? Is history ever really completely buried?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With pressing personal issues crowding into her professional life, Martine needs to solve not only the puzzle of the jewels, but some more recent crimes--including another murder, a kidnapping, and the operation of an ancient cult in Montréal--and do it before the past reaches out to silence her for good.&lt;/p&gt;" />
