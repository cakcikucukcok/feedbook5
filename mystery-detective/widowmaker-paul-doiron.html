  <title>Widowmaker - Paul Doiron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Paul Doiron&#39;s riveting novel &lt;i&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/i&gt;, Game Warden Mike Bowditch is on the trail of a ruthless vigilante amid the snow-covered mountains of Maine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a mysterious woman in distress appears outside his home, Mike Bowditch has no clue she is about to blow his world apart. Amber Langstrom is beautiful, damaged, and hiding a secret with a link to his past. She claims her son Adam is a wrongfully convicted sex offender who has vanished from a brutal work camp in the high timber around the Widowmaker Ski Resort. She also claims that Adam is the illegitimate son of Jack Bowditch, Mike&#39;s dead and diabolical father--and the half-brother Mike never knew he had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After trying so hard to put his troubled past behind him, Mike is reluctant to revisit the wild country of his childhood and again confront his father&#39;s history of violence. But Amber&#39;s desperation and his own need to know the truth leads Mike on a desperate search for answers--one that takes him through a mountainous wilderness where the military guards a top-secret interrogation base, sexual predators live together in a backwoods colony, and self-styled vigilantes are willing to murder anyone they consider their enemies. Can Mike finally exorcise the demons of the past--or will the real-life demons of the present kill him first?&lt;/p&gt;" />
