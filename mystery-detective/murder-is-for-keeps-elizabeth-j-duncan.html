  <title>Murder Is for Keeps - Elizabeth J. Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Murder is for Keeps,&lt;/i&gt; the latest book in an award-winning mystery series, celebrated for its small-town charm and picturesque Welsh setting, starring amateur sleuth Penny Brannigan.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local artist Penny Brannigan has been spending her summer painting Gwrych Castle and its surrounding landscapes. A privately owned, castellated Welsh country house, Gwrych has been sadly neglected for decades and is in a heartbreaking state of disrepair. So when she learns architectural historian Mark Baker is leading a team of enthusiastic volunteers to restore the castle grounds and gardens to their former grandeur, Penny is thrilled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s not long before disagreements over the restoration turn deadly, and Penny is horrified to discover the body of a volunteer hidden in a castle outbuilding. Penny enlists her friend Gareth Davies, recently retired from the North Wales Police Service, to help investigate. As the two dig deeper into the castle&#39;s history, including its glamorous heyday in the 1920s, they find startling connections between an old, unsolved murder and Gareth&#39;s own family, and as they solve the present-day murder, Penny recovers a stunning piece of the castle&#39;s architectural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
