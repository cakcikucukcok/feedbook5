  <title>Stranger At Home - George Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Four years. That&#39;s how long it took Californian playboy Michael Vickers to regain his memory and come home. Four years. That&#39;s how long Vickers spent battered, bruised and south of the border, following the attack which sought to end his life - all because he&#39;d mistaken a mortal enemy for a friend. Or a lover. And now Vickers is looking for four years&#39; worth of payback from the devil responsible for his near-demise. But within days of Vickers&#39; return, a murder attempt is made on one of his suspects - and this time it succeeds. Enter a very shrewd detective, whose eyes are on everyone. Especially Vickers. In Stranger at Home, the second George Sanders mystery novel, we are taken to a world removed from the backstage comic mystery of Crime on My Hands, but nonetheless a milieu very familiar to the actor - Southern California in the 1940&#39;s. A world of stars and millionaires, but also vice, organized crime and shattered dreams. And Michael Vickers himself is a hero very much after the mould of Sanders&#39; irresistibly attractive screen persona - gilded and charming, languid and pleasure-seeking... but with a steely, remorseless core." />
