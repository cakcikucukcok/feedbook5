  <title>Sugar and Spice and              Everything Deadly - Sissy Nelsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the sound of the gavel an 
                   instant hush fell over the courtroom as
                   Alice Wray and her attorney stood up to
                  hear the judges sentencing.
                        All eyes were on Alice Wray who
                  stood straight, face masked in indifference,
                 not a noticeable tear in her eyes.
                       Alice Wray would you like to address
                 the court before sentencing? Judge Ellis asked.
                        There was dead silence in the courtroom
                  Everyone seemed to be holding their breath 
                  as the barely audible whispered words of
                 Alice Wray were heard, No, thank you.
                         Judge Ellis frowned. Well, I would like to
                say something, he said. Never, in all my
                years on the bench, which amounts to a
                total of twenty-two years, have I witnessed
               such a senseless and deliberate act of murder.
            .  It grieves me to think a mother could be
              capable of killing her own innocent children.
              Alice Wray you are hereby sentenced to
              life in prison without benefit of parole." />
