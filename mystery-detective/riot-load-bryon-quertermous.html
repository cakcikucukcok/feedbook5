  <title>Riot Load - Bryon Quertermous</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Dominick Prince returns. Probably against his better judgment.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dominick Prince went through hell to make his dreams come true. He has a book deal, time and money to write whatever he wants, and a marriage to his college crush with a child on the way. But instead of working on his next book, Dominick spends his days as a mindless office drone at the university cancer center while his wife chases bail jumpers.  When an old friend reappears to call in a favor, Dominick sees an opportunity for a little excitement.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The plan seems simple. Dominick will use his access at the hospital to help steal the last remaining piece of her murdered lover: a sperm sample left during prostate cancer treatment. Standing in their way are a pair of brothers who find kidnapping potential children superior to kidnapping actual children, and Dominick&amp;#8217;s wife who has her own plans for it. Torn between his wife&amp;#8217;s wrath and the debt he owes his friend, Dominick taps into the most devious parts of his crime fiction training to write himself a proper ending where he saves the day, saves the girl, and lives to write another day. Unless he blows it all to hell.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
