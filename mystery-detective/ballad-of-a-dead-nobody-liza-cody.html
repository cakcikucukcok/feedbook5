  <title>Ballad of a Dead Nobody - Liza Cody</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Elly Astoria had a miraculous musical talent. As a little girl she taught herself to play guitar and keyboard so that she could feed herself and her junkie mother. One rainy night she was spotted singing and playing by the founder of an indy womens band. Later, cleaned up and better fed, she caught the eye of her future manager  and his creepy sister. It should have been a rags-to-riches story. Instead Ellys career was cut short by her perverted and grisly murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years after her death it looks as if Ellys life has been overlooked. If anyone deserves rediscovery and a biography, its Elly. Clearly there is a story to be told and a mystery to be solved. But how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Anna Lee&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric with suspense, fast and funny...&lt;br&gt;
Publishers Weekly&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loud hurrahs... story wonderfully alive, truly tense, dialogue sharp and accurate!&lt;br&gt;
HRF Keating, The Times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About  Eva Wylie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A staggering achievement... A breath-taking tour de force.&lt;br&gt;
Sara Paretsky&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...Eva is a wondrous creation  an incorrigible innocent in a story that crackles with energy. Super Cody.&lt;br&gt;
Kirkus Reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Gimme More&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any one with the slightest interest in the world of music will ?nd this a thriller they wont want to put down.&lt;br&gt;
Anthony Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the greatest rocknroll novel ever.&lt;br&gt;
Nick Johnstone, uncut&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
