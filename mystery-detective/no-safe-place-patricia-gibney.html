  <title>No Safe Place - Patricia Gibney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;There&#39;s nothing more dangerous than a familiar face...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As funeral mourners stand in silence at Ragmullin cemetery, a deafening cry cuts through the air. Lying crumpled at the bottom of an open grave is the bloodied body of a young woman, and &lt;b&gt;Detective Lottie Parker&lt;/b&gt; is called in to investigate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing the body can&amp;#x2019;t have been there long, Lottie wonders if it could be Elizabeth Bryne, a young woman who vanished without trace just days earlier. And with a new boss who seems to have it in for her, Lottie is under pressure to solve both cases quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As two more women go missing from Ragmullin, Lottie and her team fear there is a serial killer on the loose. And the disappearances are strikingly similar to a cold case from ten years earlier. Could history be repeating itself? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As journalists begin to interfere with Lottie&amp;#x2019;s investigation, she fears the killer is about to strike again. Lottie is in a race against time to find the missing women, but the killer is closer than she thinks. &lt;b&gt;Could Lottie be his next target?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you love Angela Marsons, Robert Bryndza and Rachel Abbott, you&amp;#x2019;ll love the latest pulse-pounding thriller from Patricia Gibney. &lt;i&gt;No Safe Place&lt;/i&gt; will keep you guessing until the very last page.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What readers are saying about &lt;i&gt;No Safe Place:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;A brilliant read.
