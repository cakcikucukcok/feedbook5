  <title>The Death of the Old Lady - Daniela von der Fecht</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Death of the Old Lady is a woman&#39;s pledge to come to the bottom of her employer&#39;s sudden and unexpected death.
Anna Petersen lives and works with Nora Simps in a small Cornish village. In spite of the age gap, Nora and Anna are close friends. When Anna finds Nora dead in the kitchen, she turns into a sleuth; during her investigation, she is joined by the local artist David, the police inspector Ryan, and her sister, Stella. By and by the secrets behind Nora Simps&#39;s life and death are uncovered. Also her own and her sister&#39;s life change drastically as the story unfolds and takes us from Cornwall to the Lake District and briefly to Germany.
Things and people are not always what they seem, and dreams can be shattered in the blink of an eye; however, they can also be reconstructed through faith and love, and sometimes we need to change to meet our true purpose." />
