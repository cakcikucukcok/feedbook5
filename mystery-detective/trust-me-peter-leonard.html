  <title>Trust Me - Peter Leonard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Peter Leonard showed remarkable maturity for a first-time novelist in his debut novel &lt;i&gt;Quiver&lt;/i&gt;. In &lt;i&gt;Trust Me&lt;/i&gt;, he reaches for new heights as he crafts a classic noir thriller loaded with double- and triple-crosses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first mistake Karen Delaney made was entrusting $300,000 to her boyfriend, Samir, the head of an illegal bookmaking operation. The second was breaking up with him---because Samir holds a $300,000 grudge. A few months later, Karen sees a way to get her money back when two thieves break into her house in the middle of the night. She proposes a scheme to steal Samir&#39;s safe, but Karen soon realizes she&#39;s in way over her head as things begin to spin out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trust Me&lt;/i&gt; moves at breakneck speed through the affluent suburbs of Detroit and Chicago as Karen is pursued by O&#39;Clair, an ex-con/ex-cop who works for Samir and wants the money for his own retirement; by Ricky, Samir&#39;s nephew, who sees the money as a way to pay off his own escalating gambling debts; by the thieves who&#39;ve been double-crossed; and by two ruthless hit men who view the money as their stake in the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With relentless suspense, striking characters, and plot twists that will leave you white-knuckled, &lt;i&gt;Trust Me&lt;/i&gt; marks the continuation of a powerful new voice in crime fiction and more than delivers on the promise of Peter Leonard&#39;s talent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
