  <title>The Thomas Brief - Toni Mills</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At 32, as one of the city&#39;s most eligible divorce attorney&#39;s at Bailey, Brooks, and Bailey law firm, Kenneth Thomas has all the right ingredients that make him the perfect man. He&#39;s tall, dark, handsome, intelligent, successful and can have any woman that he wants. But at his age he&#39;s made the decision that at this point in his life, it is time to settle down with the one woman whom he will potentially marry and start a family with. However, before he begins his journey of finding the right woman, Kenneth knows he must terminate his intimate relationship with Susan. Susan seems to be the ideal woman for him but there is one major dilemma. She is currently one of the firm&#39;s executive assistants and could possibly harm Kenneth&#39;s reputation and jeopardize his chances of becoming partner someday if their relationship carries on.
Through his eyes, follow this tantalizing  case as Kenneth is trapped in a chess game of joy and turmoil when his efforts to end his lustful office romance takes a turn for the worst and interferes with his quest to find true love. Will Susan calmly back away from their affair or will she turn into the nightmare Kenneth never saw coming? For the first time, he will see what it&#39;s like to be on the opposite side of the witness stand as his unsightly dreams become his reality." />
