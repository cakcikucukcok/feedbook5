  <title>Dirty Money - P.I. Foate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dirty Money is the first novel in a new trilogy by a promising new Swedish author, P.I. Foate. Readers will be captivated and enthralled by this gripping and intense  drama about events and people whose paths were changed by the horrifying events of September 11, 2001. 
In 2007, Peter Wall appears to lead an ordinary, although not entirely law-abiding, middle-class life in Manchester, England. Suddenly, his luck comes to an end and he fears that his money-laundering scheme is about to be discovered by the authorities. He makes a run for it, taking with him the money of some of his sinister clients.  
Peter cleverly evades both sets of pursuers by leaving a false trail across Europe.  As his pursuers close in on him on the Greek island of Mykonos, it seems as if the end is near, not only for Peter but also for his clients, who, unknown to them, are also being investigated by the authorities. 
All is, however, not as it seems. Peter has a secret, which only two of his closest friends know.  Dick Monson and Christos Xenitidis have been working together for years in a secret anti-terrorism unit of MI5. Is Peter ready to join them or is it too late for him to redeem himself? 
Follow what happens next in this suspenseful saga about the efforts of these dedicated men in their journey towards justice, in this novel and the remaining two novels in the trilogy, The Forgotten Children and Its Never too Late." />
