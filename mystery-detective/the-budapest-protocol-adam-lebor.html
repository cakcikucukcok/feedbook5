  <title>The Budapest Protocol - Adam LeBor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;     Nazi-occupied Budapest, Winter 1944. The Russians are smashing through the German lines. Miklos Farkas breaks out of the Jewish ghetto to find food &amp;#150; at the Nazis&amp;#8217; headquarters. There he is handed a stolen copy of The Budapest Protocol, detailing the Nazis&amp;#8217; post-war plans. Miklos knows it must stay hidden forever if he is to stay alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Present day Budapest. As the European Union launches the election campaign for the first President of Europe, Miklos Farkas is brutally murdered. His journalist grandson Alex buries his grief to track down the killers. He soon unravels a chilling conspiracy rooted in the dying days of the Third Reich, one that will ensure Nazi economic domination of Europe &amp;#150; and a plan for a new Gypsy Holocaust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hunt is on for The Budapest Protocol. Alex is soon drawn deeper into a deadly web of intrigue and power play, a game played for the highest stakes: the very future of Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Budapest Protocol&lt;/i&gt; is a journey into Europe&amp;#8217;s hidden heart of darkness ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     &quot;If this novel was a handbag it would be a black Chanel&amp;#151;beautifully made, perfect for every occasion and just a little old-fashioned (in a good way). . . .

Would that all debut novels were so ambitious, timely and relevant.&quot;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Irish Times&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A thoroughly enjoyable debut.&quot; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jewish Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A well-paced Eurothriller that rolls today&amp;#8217;s headlines&amp;#151;terrorism, loss of liberty, political subterfuge and racial tension&amp;#151;into a conspiracy from the past that threatens the future of the continent.
