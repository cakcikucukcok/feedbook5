  <title>While They Were Dying - Samuel Peter Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Samuel Peter Shaws drama of love and betrayal is peopled by the Sink Set, a group of fickle, moneyed sophisticates living in London&#39;s leafy southern suburbs.  For all but one of them, the Iraq War is sobering but coincidental, a backdrop against which they shrug and carry on. 
Colly Wolfson, a member of the Set, is a forty-something prize-winning architect and builder; wealthy, debonair, popular. But personal tragedy strikes him twice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcome by grief and guilt, he tries to make amends, but keeps his efforts secret. For a time, he believes he might achieve a new beginning. But in 2003  on the anniversary of his own tragedies  he is horrified by the numbing, hi-tech bombing of Baghdad. It leaves him isolated among his uncaring friends  and it unhinges him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly unhappy and with his marriage crumbling, he drifts into two affairs  and the downward spiral begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While They Were Dying is the story of a man falling apart  and of the efforts of his family and friends to save him; a story of love and devotion, betrayal and deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all the while, among the laughter and the tears, is Colly&#39;s ever-present obsession with the monster in the corner  the Iraq War of Bush and Blair.&lt;/p&gt;" />
