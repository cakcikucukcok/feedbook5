  <title>The Resurrection of Hannah - Kathryne Arnold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Samantha Clark is fast approaching a crossroads in her life, she just doesn&#39;t know it yet. In her late thirties, single, and caught up in the hustle of everyday life, she is disenchanted with her predictable lifestyle as a psychotherapist on the west coast of Florida. Sammi begins to experience troubling physical symptoms and turns to alternative medicine in her quest for answers. Through experimentation and curiosity, startling events begin to unfold, revealing a dream world where she becomes transfixed by an overpowering spiritual connection. This unlikely teacher shows  Sammi how to move beyond her physical self, to be open to other levels of existence, to break free from the emotional bonds that hold her back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an exciting relationship blossoms in her present life, Sammi stumbles upon a centuries-old past, forcing her to examine personal beliefs as she struggles to stay adrift in both worlds. Held spellbound by her extraordinary history, she retraces her past life, discovering that it holds the key to her current dilemmas. She soon becomes entangled in a mysterious murder from which there is no turning back. Sammi must now solve the crime in order to cut the cord that binds her to a long-ago past, freeing her at last to live fully in the present.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Kathryne Arnold has interweaved themes of the paranormal with the current realities of everyday life, creating a complexly rich psychological tale. The Resurrection of Hannah is an unforgettable story of self-discovery, friendship, love beyond time and the resiliency of the human spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
