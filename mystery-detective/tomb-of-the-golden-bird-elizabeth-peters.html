  <title>Tomb of the Golden Bird - Elizabeth Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Convinced that the tomb of the little-known king Tutankhamon lies somewhere in the Valley of the Kings, eminent Egyptologist Radcliffe Emerson and his intrepid wife, Amelia Peabody, seem to have hit a wall. Having been banned forever from the East Valley, Emerson, against Amelia&#39;s advice, has tried desperately to persuade Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter to relinquish their digging rights. But Emerson&#39;s trickery has backfired, and his insistent interest in the site has made his rivals all the more determined to keep the Emerson clan away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powerless to intervene but determined to stay close to the unattainable tomb, the family returns to Luxor and prepares to continue their dig in the less promising West Valley&amp;#8212;and to watch from the sidelines as Carter and Carnarvon &quot;discover&quot; the greatest Egyptian treasure of all time: King Tut&#39;s tomb.

Now Amelia must find a way to protect her family&amp;#8212;and perhaps even her would-be nemesis&amp;#8212;from the sinister forces that will stop at nothing to succeed in the nefarious plot that threatens the peace of the entire region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with heart-stopping suspense, political intrigue, and Amelia Peabody&#39;s trademark wit and wisdom, &lt;em&gt;Tomb of the Golden Bird&lt;/em&gt; is the latest thrilling installment from the renowned and beloved &quot;grande dame of historical mystery&quot; (&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;" />
