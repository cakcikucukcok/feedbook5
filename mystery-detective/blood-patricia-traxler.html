  <title>Blood - Patricia Traxler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From talented newcomer Patricia Traxler comes a brilliant literary suspense novel about how desire can become jealousy, obsession, and finally murderous rage. Blood is equal parts auspicious literary debut, pageturner, and erotic novel about four people whose lives become irrevocably intertwined during one year at Radcliffe College. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The narrator, Norrie Blume, is a painter who has accepted a prestigious fellowship at the college; she&#39;s excited to leave her job as a commercial graphic designer and take up the artist&#39;s life. But she&#39;s also in the middle of an intense love affair with a married colleague, an affair that is threatening to consume both their lives. At Radcliffe, Norrie develops friendships with two other fellows, a journalist and a poet. One is deep, comforting; the other ruled by need and guilt. These three intense relationships quickly begin to infringe upon each other, and soon the four of them seem to be hurtling toward some shocking-and perhaps tragic-end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blood&lt;/i&gt; is a triumph of suspense writing, a true psychological thriller about the nature of desire and the danger of love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
