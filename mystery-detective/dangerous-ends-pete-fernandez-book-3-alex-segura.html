  <title>Dangerous Ends: (Pete Fernandez Book 3) - Alex Segura</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Pete Fernandez has settled into an easy, if somewhat boring life as a P.I.. He takes pictures of cheating husbands. He tracks criminals who&#39;ve skipped bail and he attends weekly AA meetings The days of chasing murderous killers are behind him. Or are they?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When his sometimes partner Kathy Bentley approaches him with a potential new client, Pete balks. Not because he doesn&#39;t need the money, but because the case involves Gaspar Varela, a former Miami police officer serving a life sentence for the murder of his wife - one of the most infamous crimes in Miami history. The client? None other than Varela&#39;s daughter, Maya, who has doggedly supported her father&#39;s claims of innocence.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As Pete and Kathy wade into a case that no one wants, they also find themselves in the crosshairs of Los Enfermos, a bloodthirsty gang of pro-Castro killers and drug dealers looking to wipe Pete off the Miami map. As if trying to exonerate Varela wasn&#39;t enough, they find themselves entangled in something even older and more surprising: a bloody, political hit ordered by Fidel Castro himself, that left a still-healing scar on Pete and his dead father&#39;s past.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fast-paced, hardboiled and surprising, Dangerous Ends pushes Pete Fernandez into a battle with a deadlier, more complex threat, as he tries to shake off the demons haunting Miami&#39;s own, sordid past.&lt;/div&gt;" />
