  <title>To Play the Fool - Laurie R. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Celebrated author Laurie R. King dazzles mystery lovers once again in &lt;i&gt;To Play the Fool,&lt;/i&gt; her second Kate Martinelli mystery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story unfolds as a band of homeless people cremate a beloved dog in San Francisco&#39;s Golden Gate Park. When it comes to incidents like this, the authorities are willing to overlook a few broken regulations. But three weeks later, after the dog&#39;s owner gets the same fiery send-off, the SFPD knows it has a serious problem on its hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other than the fact that they&#39;re dealing with a particularly grisly homicide, Inspector Kate Martinelli and her partner, Al Hawkin, have little else to go on. They have a homeless victim without a positive ID, a group of witnesses who have little love for the cops, and a possible suspect, known only as Brother Erasmus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate learns that Erasmus is well-acquainted with the park&#39;s homeless and with the rarefied atmosphere of Berkeley&#39;s Graduate Theological Union, yet he remains an enigma to all. It&#39;s apparent that he is by no means crazy--but he is a fool.  Kate begins the frustrating task of interrogating a man who communicates only through quotations. Trying to learn something of his history leads her along a twisting road to a disbanded cult, long-buried secrets, the thirst for spirituality, and the hunger for bloody vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
