  <title>Caught In the Shadows - C. A. Haddad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Becky Belski: a nice small-town girl with a nice computer research job in Chicago.  Sort of.&lt;br&gt;Okay, so she&#39;s not always nice, and her &quot;research job&quot;--which entails digging up electronic dirt on people through computer networks--borders on the illegal.  So her past is a little murky, what with her mother convicted of killing Becky&#39;s stepfather.  Still--the case is closed, her mother long dead: How could a high-profile divorce case shake up her humdrum world of sweatsuits and take-out Chinese?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wealthy socialite has shot her husband, and her lawyers have hired Becky to do some computerized snooping.  A straightforward assignment, until the digging reveals a link between the victim and Becky&#39;s own half-forgotten past.  The connection provides Becky with the chance to unearth the real story behind her mother&#39;s conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plot is further thickened by (1) Michael, cute-but-klutzy lawyer for the defense, and (2) Bill, Becky&#39;s long-lost stepbrother.  When Becky finds herself in the odd position of being attracted to Bill, it brings a whole new meaning to the term &quot;family affair.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to sort everything out leads Becky to believe that there are some unhappy families that are unhappy in their own truly remarkable ways.&lt;/p&gt;" />
