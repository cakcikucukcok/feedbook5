  <title>The Door to Sambucca - Jim Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story takes places in and around New York City. During a decade past the era of the Vietnam War, a middle-aged man named Nathan has found refuge from the destructive forces that surrounded his combat experience. Having moved onto adulthood from a life as an adopted boy and tournament-fighting martial artist, his surrogate family had put the memories of his horrific young childhood to rest. When the man returns from the war to find yet another traumatic event in his life, he can not contain his sanity and looses all that his adopted family had built into him.
 	At the pinnacle of his sorrow, a former restaurant-chain owner from Manhattan, Hank, finds him distraught on a park bench in Chinatown. Once again, Nathan is taken into another&#39;s arms, and he goes to live on Hank&#39;s farm where he finds relative peace for 10 years - but Hank could not bring him out of his solitude.
 	A Shaolin Master from the Temple in Brooklyn, Wong,  sets out to the farm to open up Nathan&#39;s mind and bring back the strength of his youth to resolve the trauma once and for all. Nathan then makes a mature decision to go to New York City and find the Door to Sambucca, and pass through it, and what he found on the other side would be the answer God would give him." />
