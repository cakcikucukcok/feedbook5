  <title>Never Look Back - Clare Donoghue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Never Look Back&lt;/i&gt;, three young women have been found brutally murdered in south London, their bodies discarded in plain view, the victims only yards away from help during each attack. And each time, the murderer gets a little bit bolder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detective Inspector Mike Lockyer is the head of homicide on the South London police force, and with three bodies on his watch and a killer growing in confidence, he and DS Jane Bennett are frantically trying to find the link between these seemingly isolated incidents. Slowly, the case is also invading Lockyer&#39;s life outside the office, and the fact that his daughter matches the victim profile is putting a painful strain on their already fragile relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Sarah Grainger has a shadowy stalker following her every move. Once an outgoing London photographer, Sarah has begun locking herself away, almost too afraid to leave the house. Now her stalker&#39;s actions are escalating. He&#39;s desperate to tell Sarah a secret...a secret that Lockyer needs to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her compelling and tautly-written debut, Clare Donoghue traces the paths of these captivating, three-dimensional characters as their lives become dangerously and inextricably entwined.&lt;/p&gt;" />
