  <title>Land of the Saints - Robert P. DesJardins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jeff Wells, a successful attorney in Los Angeles, is also a western pleasure horseman who seeks out the solitude and serenity of the American Southwest when he wants to get away from it all. But his current trip to Arizona is for business. His friend, Big Jim Higgins, is in trouble and needs Jeffs help. Big Jim has been charged with the murder of three rustlers, and hes being held without bail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, Jeff finds himself drawn into the strange, mysterious, and surprisingly dangerous world of Mormon spirituality. Big Jim lives in a world where friends and foes alike search for the most sacred of Mormon artifacts, the Golden Plates. Jeff is introduced to the realm of seer stones, blood oaths, and the magical Golden Plates, reputed to be written in ancient hieroglyphics by the Angel Moroni and his predecessors, who lived in North America hundreds of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for and the mystery surrounding the Golden Plates leads Jeff not only into a land of unbridled greed and hypocrisy but also into the realm of Native American mysticism. Jeff is drawn to the mystical Four Corners region, where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah meet. Jeff encounters Lutakaw, a Hopi holy man who helps Jeff unearth the Golden Plates.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of his discovery change the shape of this religion in a dramatic fashion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
