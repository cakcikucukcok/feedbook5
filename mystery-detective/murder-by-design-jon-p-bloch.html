  <title>Murder by Design - Jon P. Bloch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rick Domino is at the very top in his world - which is Hollywood - and his stock in trade is celebrity gossip.  His finances, however, are the pits and can&#39;t begin to pay for his copious good taste.  So when his producer &#39;suggests&#39; he be a guest on a popular cable decorating/reality program - &quot;My House, Your House&quot; - Rick agrees to appear not only because he&#39;s not really given a choice in the matter but it&#39;s a chance at a free makeover for his sagging, outdated living room.  As plans go, this isn&#39;t Rick&#39;s best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it all quickly goes horribly wrong.  The consulting designer assigned to his house is well known for the particularly dreadful remodeling horrors she&#39;s perpetrated on other guest&#39;s spaces. To make matters more unpleasant, Rick is teamed up with his bitterest professional enemy - his grasping, bitch co-host Mitzi McGuire-while the other &#39;couple&#39; in the program is his friend Terry Zane - a sweet but savagely unstylish police detective - and Terry&#39;s recent ex-wife, the charmless Darla Sue. As if this mess wasn&#39;t big enough, one of the designers is savagely-if perhaps understandably-murdered and the prime suspect is Terry Zane&#39;s cousin.  With Terry&#39;s help, Rick Domino is on a quest to rescue his reputation, salvage his living room, and - if at all possible - find the person responsible for this particularly tasteless act of murder.&lt;/p&gt;" />
