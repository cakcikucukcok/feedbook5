  <title>Doing It at the Dixie Dew - Ruth Moose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who says you can&#39;t go home again?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;When Beth McKenzie returns to her hometown and attempts to turn an old Southern mansion into a bed and breakfast called The Dixie Dew, her first guest is murdered. Three days later a young priest who looks better in tennis whites than cleric black is found strangled in his chapel. The whole town of Littleboro is turned upside down, inside out, and Ossie Delbardo, the town cop whose job heretofore mainly involved controlling football traffic on Friday nights, is not cut out to solve the murders. Beth fears her newly opened B&amp;B is in danger of failing. She&#39;s even more worried that she is Ossie&#39;s number one suspect. Aided by her friend from high school and trusty handyman, she sets out to discover the truth of the murders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Littleboro has its share of characters, some of which are helpful and others misleading. There&#39;s Crazy Reba who lives in a tree, bathes in any bathtub she finds empty, and Dumpster dives; Verna, the town know-it-all and affectionate owner of Robert Redford, a huge white rabbit; and Miss Tempie Merritt, music teacher and organist who always wears hat, gloves, and lace-trimmed white socks. When Beth herself is attacked, there&#39;s no more time for baking muffins and stenciling pineapples on the porch. She&#39;s in a race to uncover her neighbors&#39; secrets before her hometown becomes her burial ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruth Moose&#39;s&lt;i&gt; Doing It at the Dixie Dew&lt;/i&gt; is a charming and delightful debut.&lt;/p&gt;" />
