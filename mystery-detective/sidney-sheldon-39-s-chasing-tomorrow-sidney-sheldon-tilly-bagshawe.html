With her suave and handsome partner, Jeff Stevens, she&amp;#8217;d been responsible for some of the world&amp;#8217;s most astounding heists, relishing the danger and intensity of life on the wild side.

But as the months pass and Tracy&amp;#8217;s longed for pregnancy doesn&amp;#8217;t happen, she finds herself yearning for the adrenaline rush of the old days.&amp;#160; When a mysterious and beautiful stranger enters their lives, Tracy and Jeff&amp;#8217;s once unbreakable partnership is suddenly blown wide open.
