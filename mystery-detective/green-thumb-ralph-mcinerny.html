  <title>Green Thumb - Ralph McInerny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One early morning during spring break, Detectives Phil Knight and Jimmie Stewart are enjoying a golf game at the University of Notre Dame when they find a man apparently suffering a heart attack on the green. They summon help and the man is rushed to the emergency room.  But it&#39;s too late--the man dies at the hospital and an autopsy suggests that his death was not an accident.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victim--poisoned with deadly nightshade--turns out to be Mortimer Sadler, something of a boor but also an extremely generous donor to the university. He&#39;d returned to campus for an unofficial class reunion, along with several classmates, including his three college roommates.  Soon, long-buried animosities surface among the old friends. But are these old wounds strong enough to result in murder?  Or was there a more recent disagreement brewing? Phil and his brother Professor Roger Knight team up to uncover the truth behind Sadler&#39;s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Green Thumb&lt;/i&gt; is an intriguing addition to this series by the author of the beloved Father Dowling mysteries.  Filled with suspense and plot twists galore, not to mention McInerny&#39;s trademark clever wit, it&#39;s guaranteed to enchant new readers as well as dedicated fans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
