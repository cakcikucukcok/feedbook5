  <title>Death Was the Other Woman - Linda L. Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the lawlessness of Prohibition pushes against the desperation of the Depression, there are two ways to make a living in Los Angeles: join the criminals or collar them. Kitty Pangborn has chosen the crime-fighters, becoming secretary to Dexter J. Theroux, one of the hard-drinking, tough-talking PIs who pepper the city&#39;s stew. But after Dex takes an assignment from Rita Heppelwaite, the mistress of Harrison Dempsey, one of L.A.&#39;s shadiest--and richest--businessmen, Kitty isn&#39;t so sure what side of the law she&#39;s on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rita suspects Dempsey has been stepping out and asks Dex to tail him. It&#39;s an easy enough task, but Dex&#39;s morning stroll with Johnnie Walker would make it tough for him to trail his own shadow. Kitty insists she go along for the ride, keeping her boss--and hopefully her salary--safe. However, she&#39;s about to realize that there&#39;s something far more unpleasant than a three-timing husband at the end of this trail, and that there&#39;s more at risk than her paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richly satisfying and stylishly gritty, &lt;i&gt;Death Was the Other Woman &lt;/i&gt;gives a brand-new twist to the hard-boiled style, revealing that while veteran PIs like Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe spent their time slugging scotch and wooing women, it may well have been the Girl Fridays of the world who really cracked the cases.&lt;/p&gt;" />
