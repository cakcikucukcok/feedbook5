  <title>Peach Cobbler Murder - Joanne Fluke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With The Cookie Jar, Hannah Swensen has a mouthwatering monopoly on the bakery business of Lake Eden, Minnesota. But when a rival store opens, tensions begin to bubble.  .  .&lt;P&gt;As she sits in her nearly empty store on Groundhog Day, Hannah can only hope that spring is just around the corner--and that the popularity of the new Magnolia Blossom Bakery is just a passing fad. The southern hospitality of Lake Eden&#39;s two Georgia transplants, Shawna Lee and Vanessa Quinn, is grating on Hannah&#39;s nerves--and cutting into her profits.&lt;P&gt;At least Hannah has her business partner Lisa&#39;s wedding to look forward to. Unfortunately, Shawna Lee has finagled an invitation to the reception--and is bringing her Southern Peach Cobbler for the dessert table. Things go from bad to worse when Shawna Lee and Hannah&#39;s sometime-boyfriend, Detective Mike Kingston, are no-shows to the wedding. When Hannah sees lights on at the Magnolia Blossom Bakery after the reception, she investigates--and finds Shawna Lee shot to death.&lt;P&gt;Everyone in town knew the Cookie Jar&#39;s business was suffering--a fact that puts Hannah at the top of the initial list of suspects. But with a little help from her friends, Hannah&#39;s determined to track down whoever had the right ingredients to whip up a murder.  .  .&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Includes 10 Original Dessert Recipes For You To Try! &lt;/B&gt;" />
