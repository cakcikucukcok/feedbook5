  <title>The Secret Sister - Brenda Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Did she once have a sister? Has her mother lied all these years? Why?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After a painful divorce, Maisey Lazarow returns to Fairham, the small island off the North Carolina coast where she grew up. She goes there to heal–and to help her brother, Keith, a deeply troubled man who&#39;s asked her to come home. But she refuses to stay in the family house. The last person she wants to see is the wealthy, controlling mother she escaped years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instead, she finds herself living next door to someone else she&#39;d prefer to avoid–Rafe Romero, the wild, reckless boy to whom she lost her virginity at sixteen. He&#39;s back on the island, and to her surprise, he&#39;s raising a young daughter alone. Maisey&#39;s still attracted to him, but her heart&#39;s too broken to risk…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then something even more disturbing happens. She discovers a box of photographs that evoke distant memories of a little girl, a child Keith remembers, too. Maisey believes the girl must&#39;ve been their sister, but their mother claims there was no sister.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maisey&#39;s convinced that child existed. So where is she now?&lt;/p&gt;
