  <title>Bamijoko - Princess Theo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bamijoko portrays a young, promising, intelligent, and pretty girl whom her family placed a lot of confidence in. However, she strayed away from her valuable family upbringing through peer group influence while in a higher institution. In the school, she was brainwashed into adopting a religious faith alien to her family, and this virtually affected her entire being by turning her to view life from a bizarre perspective, and anyone who kicked against her new world was seen as demon-possessed. This arcane belief eventually led to her demise. Many suggestions such as schizophrenia, a broken covenant, misplaced religious priority, spiritual ties, etc., were believed to have caused her death. These, however, were mere suppositions because no autopsy was carried out on her body. Maybe readers can pin one or two things together to guess what killed Bami." />
