  <title>Blackout - Ragnar Jónasson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A huge bestseller in England, France, and Australia, the third book in the Dark Iceland series from a spectacular new crime writer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Easily the best yet. Beautifully written and elegantly paced with a plot that only gradually becomes visible, as if the reader had been staring into the freezing fog waiting for shapes to emerge.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;, UK (Readers&#39; Books of the Year 2016)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A chiller of a thriller whose style and pace are influenced by Jonasson&#39;s admiration for Agatha Christie. It&#39;s good enough to share shelf space with the works of Yrsa Sigurdardottir and Arnaldur Indridason, Iceland&#39;s crime novel royalty.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hailed for combining the darkness of Nordic Noir with classic mystery writing in the tradition of Agatha Christie, author Ragnar Jonasson&#39;s books are haunting, atmospheric, and complex. &lt;i&gt;Blackout&lt;/i&gt;, the latest Ari Thór thriller, delivers another dark mystery that is chillingly stunning with its complexity and fluidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the shores of a tranquil fjord in Northern Iceland, a man is brutally beaten to death on a bright summer&#39;s night. As the 24-hour light of the arctic summer is transformed into darkness by an ash cloud from a recent volcanic eruption, a young reporter leaves Reykajvik to investigate on her own, unaware that an innocent person&#39;s life hangs in the balance. Ari Thor Arason and his colleagues on the tiny police force in Siglufjordur struggle with an increasingly perplexing case, while their own serious personal problems push them to the limit. What secrets does the dead man harbour, and what is the young reporter hiding? As silent, unspoken horrors from the past threaten them all, and the darkness deepens, it&#39;s a race against time to find the killer before someone else dies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
