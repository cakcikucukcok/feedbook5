  <title>Hidden in Havana - Jose Latour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Cuba, deceit is routine, paranoia is reasonable, and everything banned thrives out of sight.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elena Miranda, a special-needs teacher, has no idea what lies behind the wall in her bathroom, nor that a ruthless Vietnam vet has come to Havana to retrieve it for his employer. The beautiful woman posing as the American vet&#39;s wife is actually with him for only one reason: Her Spanish is fluent, his is nonexistent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they are there to do is neither an easy nor a pleasant task. Another man is also after what is behind that wall, and other problems complicate the job. Shortly after the Americans arrive, Elena&#39;s brother is murdered, and a Havana cop is assigned to the crime. Calmly but relentlessly, Captain Felix Trujillo begins to work on the murder and discovers that the dead man was hardly an upstanding citizen. He does find clues he can use, especially when he becomes aware that he is following not one but a trail of corpses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hidden in Havana&lt;/i&gt; is a shocking story of betrayal and cunning, where the hunters become hunted, the best-laid plans are derailed by greed and virtue, and getting valuable treasure is far less important than getting out of Cuba alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
