  <title>Christmas at Cliffhanger Inn - Cristine E. Collier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mystery always follows the women of the Writer&#39;s Club but this time with holiday flair!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill and Tara Fields are ready to celebrate the first Christmas at their Bed and Breakfast, the Cliffhanger Inn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Writer&#39;s Club will spend a few nights and celebrate the Inn&#39;s Open House, and also watch as the strange ivory mortgage button placed so long ago in the old staircase is removed. What will they find beneath it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of a Christmas tree farm, Country Evergreens, will stop by the Inn. The tree purchased at his lot has its own mystery from the past. A bizarre find beneath the pine needles around the trunk of the near perfect tree will leave the Fields questioning events surrounding this happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tara discovers an old journal written by someone named Rebecca in the 1940s. Has she stumbled on a murder mystery that took place over sixty years ago? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A last minute business luncheon at the Inn will end in near death. Was this event a coincidence or planned to get rid of an annoying employee? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A demanding, unfriendly man will spend a week at the Inn, barely leaving his room except for meals. He will leave something in the room when he signs out that completely surprises Bill and Tara. &lt;/p&gt;" />
