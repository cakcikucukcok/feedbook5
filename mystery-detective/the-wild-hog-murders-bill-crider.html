  <title>The Wild Hog Murders - Bill Crider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like most of the rest of Texas, Blacklin County is being overrun with feral hogs that destroy farmland and crops. There&#39;s hardly any defense against these pests, but they haven&#39;t been the cause of murder.  Until now. A mother and son have opened an animal shelter in the county and they welcome even feral hogs.  Someone&#39;s threatened them by slaughtering one of their animals and leaving it on their doorstep.  Then Sheriff Dan Rhodes and Deputy Ruth Grady stumble across a dead man while searching the woods for a convenience store robber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation into the man&#39;s death is complicated by angry hog hunters, a crusading talk-show host, a bounty hunter named Hoss, conflicts with the county commissioners, and the reappearance of Rapper and Nellie, the inept two-man motorcycle gang that&#39;s caused Rhodes considerable trouble in the past.  By the time he&#39;s sorted through all the clues, Rhodes discovers that quite a few people aren&#39;t who they seemed to be, including those he&#39;s known for a long time. And some of them are killers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Award-winning author Bill Crider has written an endearing and consistently entertaining series, and &lt;i&gt;The Wild Hog Murders&lt;/i&gt; offers a fresh new chance to get in on the fun.&lt;/p&gt;" />
