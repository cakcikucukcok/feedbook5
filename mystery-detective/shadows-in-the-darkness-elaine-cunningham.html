  <title>Shadows in the Darkness - Elaine Cunningham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gwen &quot;GiGi&quot; Gelman, a ten year veteran of the Providence, Rhode Island vice squad, finds herself unemployed after being blamed for a routine bust that turned into a bloodbath. GiGi is used to being on her own, though, and with the help of a DA who owes her, she&#39;s scraped together enough capital to start her own PI business, specializing in&quot;family problems&quot;-in particular runaways who have disappeared into Providence&#39;s seamy underside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a few custodian kidnapping cases under her belt, as well as a case against a Catholic school teacher/molester, Gigi is doing well for herself --until she takes on the case of a fourteen year old runaway who may or may not have been kidnapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gigi investigates, she accidentally opens the door to her own mystical past. Now long-hidden family ties threaten her, and the secret of her identity unlocks a conspiracy that reveals the forces of darkness that play in the shadows...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forces that intend to be the masters of all mortal life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
