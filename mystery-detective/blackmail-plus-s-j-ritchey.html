  <title>Blackmail Plus - S.J. Ritchey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; A local Congressman is being blackmailed for money, his staff is assaulted, kidnapped, and murdered in an effort to drive him from office. The partnership of Jennifer Watson, attorney, and Dave Randle, private investigator, are retained to discover the enemies without police assistance and publicity. The firm also represents a family of a young girl who died because of suspected mercury poisoning. But the family refuses on religious grounds to consent to an autopsy or biopsy thus eliminating possible conclusive evidence of the cause of death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Following the blackmailers after a payoff, Dave discovers a triple layer of persons involved. Using his skills as a former special service operative, Dave confronts the front men, learns about the pair who seem to organize the threats, then finally the couple behind the scheme. A corrupt businessman and the plant manager of the chemical company have conspired to oust the Congressman because of his refusal to help them thwart federal and local environmental regulations. At times the confrontations become physical, but Dave prevails over hired thugs intending to scare him away from his mission. As a final effort, the chief associate of the Congressman, a beautiful middle-aged woman, is kidnapped, moved from place to place, assaulted and raped. Dave and the police rescue her after an intensive search and physical confrontations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using the accumulating evidence, Jennifer demonstrates in the court that fish from the family pond contained excessive levels of mercury and the company is held liable. The kidnappers are brought to justice and sentenced. The Congressman decides to drop out of politics, the underlying focus of his reluctance to go public not clearly known, but suspicions hed become gay hinted at by associates.
