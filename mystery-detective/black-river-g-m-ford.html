  <title>Black River - G.M. Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is no stronger argument for the death penalty than Nicholas Balagula, the bloodthirsty West Coast crime boss who has been charged with sixty-three counts of homicide, many of them children. And now reclusive rogue journalist Frank Corso -- the only non-participant invited to observe the closed court proceedings -- stands uncomfortably in the center of the most crazed media circus to hit Seattle in years . . . until a personal tragedy diverts his attention. When photojournalist Meg Dougherty -- once Corso&#39;s lover and still his dearest friend -- comes face-to-face with a pair of cold-blooded executioners and ends up clinging weakly to life in the I.C.U., the angry lone-wolf reporter vows to make all the guilty parties pay, by his own hand if necessary. But the black river of lies, secrets, corruption, and murder surrounding both the Balagula trial and Meg&#39;s &quot;accident&quot; is much deeper and more dangerous than even Frank Corso anticipated. And if he wades in over his head, the undertow could drag him to his death.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Ford</i></b> | BLACK RIVER-VG Ford, G.M.- 2nd Corso Mobster Nicholas Balagula cut so many corners when he built a new children's hospital that 63 people died when it collapsed. Now he's up on murder charges, and Seattle true-crime writer Frank Corso, who watched Balagula's first two trials end disastrously when witnesses disappeared and jurors were bought off, is back in court for the third one, which looks like a slam dunk for the prosecution.<br /><b><i>Black River (Frank Corso, #2) by G.M. Ford</i></b> | G.M. Ford is the author of six widely praised Frank Corso novels, Fury, Black River, A Blind Eye, Red Tide, No Man's Land, and Blown Away, as well as six highly acclaimed mysteries featuring Seattle private investigator Leo Waterman. A former creative writing teacher in western Washington, Ford lives in Oregon and is currently working on his next novel.<br /><b><i>Black River: A Novel: Ford, G.M.: 9780380816217: Amazon ...</i></b> | G.M. Ford lives up to his reputation for gritty action with this second book in the Frank Corso series. Black River does not disappoint. I could find nothing to complain about, other than I wish it had been longer so I could have enjoyed it longer! Ford creates characters that you care about, and somehow he does it without rambling or excess words.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Black River - G.M.
