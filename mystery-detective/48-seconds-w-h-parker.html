  <title>48 Seconds - W. H. Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Johnny Delaney, pimp, lowlife, and extortionist, lay dead in a fleabag in Seattle. For Rick Morgan, chief audit executive for Seattle Life and Casualty, it was an immediate problem with an immense consequence. Delaney was the only link to a fifty-million-dollar diamond heist that left five men dead and Ricks company holding the bag. A case that, according to Rick, went cold faster than those five bodies.
But that wasnt all. Delaney claimed to know where the diamonds were and who took them, and he wanted to cut a deal. But now it was painfully obvious another player was in the game, someone who wanted all the marbles. With the help of Vince Guarino, a retired Seattle PD homicide detective, Rick sets out to find who that someone is and hopefully recover the diamonds." />
