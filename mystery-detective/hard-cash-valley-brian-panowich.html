  <title>Hard Cash Valley - Brian Panowich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;The plotting is skilled, as is the sleuthing, and the landscape is stunning. But it&#39;s the hard-jawed characters, with their tough talk and scarred souls, who really get under your skin.&quot; -- Marilyn Stasio, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to McFalls County and Bull Mountain in &lt;/i&gt;Hard Cash Valley&lt;i&gt;, where Brian Panowich weaves another masterful tale of Southern Noir. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dane Kirby is a broken man and no stranger to tragedy. As a life-long resident and ex-arson investigator for McFalls County, Dane has lived his life in one of the most chaotic and crime-ridden regions of the south. When he gets called in to consult on a brutal murder in a Jacksonville, Florida, motel room, he and his FBI counterpart, Special Agent Roselita Velasquez, begin an investigation that leads them back to the criminal circles of his own backyard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arnie Blackwell&#39;s murder in Jacksonville is only the beginning - and Dane and Roselita seem to be one step behind. For someone is hacking a bloody trail throughout the Southeast looking for Arnie&#39;s younger brother, a boy with Asperger&#39;s Syndrome who possesses an unusual skill with numbers that could make a lot of money and that has already gotten a lot of people killed--and has even more of the deadliest people alive willing to do anything it takes to exploit him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Dane joins in the hunt to find the boy, it swiftly becomes a race against the clock that has Dane entangled in a web of secrets involving everyone from the Filipino Mafia to distrusting federal agents to some of hardest southern outlaws he&#39;s ever known.&lt;/p&gt;" />
