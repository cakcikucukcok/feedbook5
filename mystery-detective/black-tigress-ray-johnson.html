  <title>Black Tigress - Ray Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many believe that there is no more deadly killer in the Indian forest than the Bengal tigress. But of all the predators of the subcontinent, none is more ferocious than the Black Tigress. The women of the Tamil Tigers are indeed deadly, but by far the most dangerous women are the Black Tigresses. Kent Jacobs, an American attorney, is destined to come in contact with a beautiful, but lethal, Black Tigress. Chandi is not only the most dangerous of the Black Tigers; she is also stunningly captivating , making her even more menacing. Her beauty is disarming, her determination unnerving. Her assignment: kill the Indian ambassador. Kents assignment: protect the Indian ambassador. An unstoppable force is about to meet an unmovable object.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ray Johnson takes us into the dangerous world of the Tamil rebellion in Sri Lanka. A Black Tigress has been given an assignment in the United States. Her mission: kill the Indian Ambassador. The Sinhalese Buddhists of the south of Sri Lanka are fighting for dominance. The Hindu Tamils in the north are fighting for survival. Why kill the Indian Ambassador? And why risk killing him in the United States? As in all Ray Johnsons novels, things are not always as they appear. Readers will be embedded with the dangerous characters until the final paragraph. Then the truth will be out." />
