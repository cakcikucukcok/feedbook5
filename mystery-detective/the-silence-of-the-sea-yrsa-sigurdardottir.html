  <title>The Silence of the Sea - Yrsa Sigurdardottir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Petrona Award 2015!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the queen of Icelandic crime fiction comes a truly chilling story that will leave readers breathless right up to the memorable ending. This is possibly her best book yet. Bestselling and award-winning Icelandic crime author Yrsa Sigurdardóttir has produced here a dazzling display of brilliant crime writing that is both groundbreaking and immensely satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;i&gt;The Silence of the Sea&lt;/i&gt; opens, a luxury yacht crashes into a Reykjavik pier. But the boat is empty; no one is on board. What has happened to the crew? And what has happened to the family who were very much present when the yacht left Lisbon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What should Thora Gudmundsdottir, the series sleuth, make of the rumors that the vessel was cursed? She is spooked even more when she boards the yacht and thinks she sees one of the missing children. Where is Karitas, the glamorous young wife of the yacht&#39;s former owner? And whose is the body that has washed up further along the shore?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most chilling novel yet from Yrsa Sigurdardottir, an international best-selling author at the height of her powers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
