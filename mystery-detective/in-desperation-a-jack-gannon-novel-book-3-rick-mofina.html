  <title>In Desperation (A Jack Gannon Novel, Book 3) - Rick Mofina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Eleven-year-old Tilly Martin is dragged from her suburban bedroom. Her mother, Cora, pleads for mercy but the kidnappers are clear: if they don&#39;t get their $5 million back in five days, Tilly dies. If anyone contacts police, Tilly dies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Journalist Jack Gannon&#39;s estranged sister, Cora, disappeared without a trace decades ago. Now she is frantically reaching out to him for help. Cora tells him about the shameful mistakes she&#39;s made–but she guards the one secret that may be keeping her daughter alive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A twenty-year-old assassin, haunted by the faces of the people he&#39;s executed, seeks absolution as he sets out to commit his last murders as a hired killer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the U.S. and Mexico, police and the press go flat out on Tilly&#39;s case. But as Gannon digs deeper into his anguished sister&#39;s past, the hours tick down on his niece&#39;s life and he faces losing a fragment of his rediscovered family forever.&lt;/p&gt;
