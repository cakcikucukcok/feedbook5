  <title>Secrets Can Be Murder - Beverley Armstrong-Rodman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="- - - - - The mysterious bride - - - - -
&quot;He had been the demon of every child&#39;s nightmares, the destroyer of families. He had been the devil incarnate.&quot;
First, a beautiful and mysterious bride moved in next door. She was obviously in trouble, but she kept her secrets to herself. When Vickie and Cassie found her unconscious, at the bottom of the stairs, they couldn&#39;t help getting involved.
- - - - - Death in the cemetery - - - - -
&quot;They saw that the foot belonged to a young woman, and the young woman looked to be quite dead.&quot;
The vacation in Savannah turned scary, when prostitutes began dying. The sight-seeing trip to the cemetery, turned into a race for their lives. The strange gypsy-fortune teller knew more than she should. It was time to get out of Savannah.
- - - - -The deadly garage sale discovery - - - - -
&quot;Out fell a disc, money, a white powdery substance, two pictures, and a gun.&quot;
Back safely in Niagara Falls, a seemingly harmless garage sale brings new danger. When our hapless heroines find themselves captive aboard a cruiser, they know they may have to commit murder, in order to save themselves.
The burning question is - will Cassie live long enough to make it to her own wedding?" />
