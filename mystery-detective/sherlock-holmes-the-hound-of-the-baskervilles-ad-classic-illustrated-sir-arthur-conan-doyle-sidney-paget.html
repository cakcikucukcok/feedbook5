  <title>Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles (AD Classic Illustrated) - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sidney Paget</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the 17th century Hugo Baskerville is killed by a vicious hellhound. Generations later, Sir Henry Baskerville is found dead at the family estate, and the hound of legend is to blame. Can Holmes and Watson save the next Baskerville heir from an ancient curse before it&#39;s too late? Sherlock Holmes is famous for his intellectual prowess and is renowned for his skilful use of deductive reasoning, astute observation, and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Deductive reasoning allows Holmes to impressively reveal a stranger&#39;s occupation. Similarly, by studying inanimate objects, he is able to make astonishingly detailed deductions about their owners. This mindset was a major innovation in the field of crime fiction, inspiring authors like Robert J. Sawyer, Neil Gaiman and Stephen King." />
