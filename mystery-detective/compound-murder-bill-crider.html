  <title>Compound Murder - Bill Crider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Small-town Texas sheriff Dan Rhodes is in for another puzzling mystery in this next in the entertaining, award-winning series&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before classes start one morning, the body of English instructor Earl Wellington is found outside the building of the community college. Wellington was clearly involved in a struggle with someone and has died as a result. Sheriff Dan Rhodes pursues and arrests Ike Terrell, a student who was fleeing the campus. Ike&#39;s father is Able Terrell, a survivalist who has withdrawn from society and lives in a gated compound.  He&#39;s not happy that his son has chosen to attend the college, and he&#39;s even less happy with the arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhodes discovers that Wellington and Ike had had a confrontation over a paper that Wellington insisted Ike plagiarized. Wellington also had had a confrontation with the dean and was generally disliked by the students. As the number of suspects increases, it&#39;s up to Rhodes to solve the murder while also dealing with an amusing but frustrating staff, a professor who wants to be a cop, and all the other normal occurrences that can wreak havoc in a small town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Crider&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Compound Murder&lt;/i&gt; is an enjoyable police procedural filled with surprises, chuckles, and a quirky cast that will captivate mystery readers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
