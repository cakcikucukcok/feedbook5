  <title>High School Pictures - Dan Wesolowski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;There is a sex scandal brewing at Pedro Beach High School. A certain faculty member is profiting from cyberpornand a certain website has some disturbingly familiar young females on it. Fellow teachers Gina Cha and Drake Simo form an uneasy alliance and expose a rather burned-out peer. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Gina stopped drumming and sipped her tea. And from what&lt;P&gt;I read in the L.A. Times the other day, the only truly profitable Internet&lt;P&gt;	sites are the ones that are sex-related. So it figures.&lt;P&gt;	Gina seemed to have her own script. Drake hadnt read it and&lt;P&gt;	wasnt sure where he fit into it. So sex even sells on the Internet?&lt;P&gt;	You know it. Sex sells especially on the Internet. The Internet&lt;P&gt;	is almost made for it, Gina put down her tea and ticked off her fingers. &lt;P&gt;	Its affordable, extremely accessible, and still fairly anonymous.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	Drake Simo is an ex-bicycle racer and dedicated technophobe with a one year teaching contract. As he examines the evidence, he also examines Southern Californias ravaged landscapes. For him, the experience is an eye-opening introduction to the darker side of the Internet. For tenure track Gina, other motives are at work.&lt;/P&gt;" />
