  <title>Justice for a Ranger (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (The Silver Star of Texas, Book 4) - Rita Herron</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Experience the thrill of life on the edge and set your adrenalin pumping! These gripping stories see heroic characters fight for survival and find love in the face of danger.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The cost of justice… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rugged Texas Ranger Cole McKinney, abandoned by his father, hated the thought of helping his half-brothers. They’d called him back to their home town to help solve two murder cases – with their father as the prime suspect. Solving these crimes could help mend the wounds of Cole’s past. Maybe even clear his so-called father’s name… Gorgeous and razor-sharp, Joey Hendricks was the governor’s special investigator. Working the cases with Cole caused her emotions to burn so hot, a fiery night in bed might be her only release.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Joey’s own family secrets in Justice could blow her one chance for love – and these murders – sky high.&lt;/p&gt;
