          &lt;strong&gt;COMPASS agent Grant Tyndal had been dispatched to Germany to rescue CIA translator Marie Beauclair from her terrorist captors.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the mission had already been accomplished. The resourceful undercover agent not only escaped, she vowed to go after her kidnappers. Tyndal wouldn&#39;t let that happen. One, it was too dangerous. And two–he worked alone. Marie didn&#39;t need a bodyguard or a babysitter.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What she needed was someone to help her complete a critical mission of her own. But the former Navy SEAL was already shattering her defenses. He awakened passion and tempted her to let down her guard…to risk everything for the promise of forever in his arms….&lt;/p&gt;
