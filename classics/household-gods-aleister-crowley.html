  <title>Household Gods - Aleister Crowley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an odd one. A very short play about a man and his servant girl, who is of course more than she appears. It opens on an altar, where he is bemoaning his situation... his wife has run off into the woods to be with who-knows-who...Ye household gods! By these male tears I  wear That ye shall grant this prayer. All things at odds Shall be put straight-- Harmonized, reconciled By some appointed child Of some far Fate! Which makes me wonder if Nick Cave was invoking this story in the song Do You Love Me?.... &quot;She was given to me to put things right...&quot; The servant girl appears, and maybe you can guess where it goes from there.
