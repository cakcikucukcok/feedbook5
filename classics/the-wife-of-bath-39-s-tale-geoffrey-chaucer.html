  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Wife Of Bath&amp;#39;s Tale - Geoffrey Chaucer</i></b> | The Wife of Bath’s Tale, one of the 24 stories in The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer. Before the Wife of Bath tells her tale, she offers in a long prologue a condemnation of celibacy and a lusty account of her five marriages. It is for this prologue that her tale is perhaps best known.<br /><b><i>The Wife of Bath's Tale | story by Chaucer | Britannica</i></b> | The Wife of Bath's tale is a brief Arthurian romance incorporating the widespread theme of the "loathly lady," which also appears in John Gower's Tale of Florent. It is the story of a woman magically transformed into an ugly shape who can be restored to her former state only by some specific action -- the feminine version of "The Frog Prince" in fairy tales.<br /><b><i>3.1.2 The Wife of Bath's Tale | Harvard's Geoffrey Chaucer ...</i></b> | The Wife of Bath's Tale (Middle English: the Tale of the Wyf of Bathe) is among the best-known of Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. It provides insight into the role of women in the Late Middle Ages and was probably of interest to Chaucer himself, for the character is one of his most developed ones, with her Prologue twice as long as her Tale.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Wife Of Bath&#39;s Tale - Geoffrey Chaucer</a> </h3></p><hr/>
