  <title>The Amber Witch - Wilhelm Meinhold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Amber Witch is a German novel published by Wilhelm Meinhold (1797&amp;ndash;1851) in 1838. Its German title is Maria Schweidler, die Bernsteinhexe. The novel was originally published as a literary hoax which purported to be an actual 17th-century chronicle. Meinhold later admitted to the hoax but had some difficulty in proving that he was its author.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1844, it was published in Britain as The Amber Witch in two English translations: one by E. A. Friedlander and another, more enduring, translation by Lucie, Lady Duff-Gordon. Lady Duff Gordon&amp;#39;s translation was very popular with the Victorians and went through numerous editions, including a luxurious one in 1895 illustrated by Philip Burne-Jones. The novel was a favourite of Oscar Wilde&amp;#39;s when he was a boy, and in 1861 it was made into an opera, The Amber Witch, composed by William Vincent Wallace. Wallace&amp;#39;s opera has faded into obscurity, but the novel on which it was based has continued to be republished, both on its own and in anthologies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story is set during the Thirty Years&amp;#39; War. The purported author, Reverend Abraham Schweidler, almost loses his only child, Maria, to a plot by a rejected suitor, Sheriff Appelmann, who has accused Maria of practicing witchcraft. In this he was aided by an evil and jealous woman of the neighborhood. After a trial and under threat of the most dire torture, Maria, wholly innocent of the crime, confesses. While on her way to the stake, she is rescued by a courageous young nobleman who loves her and who exposes the evil plot against her." />
