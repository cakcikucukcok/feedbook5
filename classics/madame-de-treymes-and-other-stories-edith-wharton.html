  <title>Madame de Treymes and Other Stories - Edith Wharton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;A free-spirited young American attempts to extricate herself from a failed marriage to an aristocratic Frenchman in Edith Wharton&#39;s entertaining novella. &quot;Madame de Treymes,&quot; written in 1907, offers a concise perspective on the differences between American and French society from the vantage point of a master storyteller who is also an astute observer of European manners and customs. &lt;BR&gt;This compilation of Wharton&#39;s short fiction features three additional stories. &quot;Autres Temps &amp;#8230;&quot; tells of a woman who fled New York society after the scandalous dissolution of her marriage but is compelled to return upon the occasion of her daughter&#39;s divorce and hasty remarriage. &quot;The Long Run&quot; centers on a businessman&#39;s failure to accept an offer of love that&#39;s accompanied by the risk of social stigma. In &quot;The Triumph of Night,&quot; a psychological thriller, a greedy uncle tries to appropriate a young relative&#39;s inheritance. These thought-provoking stories reflect their author&#39;s characteristic interest in the innate hypocrisy of society, generational conflicts, and challenges to moral courage.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
