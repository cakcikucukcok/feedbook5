  <title>After The Storm - T.S. Arthur</title>

&lt;br /&gt;
Timothy Shay Arthur (June 6, 1809 &amp;ndash; March 6, 1885) -- known as T.S. Arthur -- was a popular 19th-century American author. He is most famous for his temperance novel Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There (1854), which helped demonize alcohol in the eyes of the American public. He was also the author of dozens of stories for Godey&amp;#39;s Lady&amp;#39;s Book, the most popular American monthly magazine in the antebellum era, and he published and edited his own Arthur&amp;#39;s Home Magazine, a periodical in the Godey&amp;#39;s model, for many years. Virtually forgotten now, Arthur did much to articulate and disseminate the values, beliefs, and habits that defined respectable, decorous middle-class life in antebellum America." />
