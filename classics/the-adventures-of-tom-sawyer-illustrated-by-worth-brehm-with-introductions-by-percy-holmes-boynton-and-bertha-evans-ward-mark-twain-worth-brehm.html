      <meta name="description" content="Mark Twain’s “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” is a much loved and classic work of American literature. It is the story of Tom, a rambunctious young lad who lives with his Aunt Polly. Tom is a boy who doesn’t much like going to school and throughout the book does everything he can to get out of it. Near the beginning of the novel Tom exhibits his keen wit by convincing some boys to paint his Aunt Polly’s fence that he has been punished with having to do for skipping school. “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” is a story of young love. Tom falls for Becky Thatcher, the daughter of the town Judge, and tries to woe her throughout the novel. It is also the tale of boyhood adventure and camaraderie. Tom and his friend Huckleberry Finn witness a murder, become pirates, are thought to be dead, and search for lost treasure. Set within the Mississippi river valley of Twain’s youth, the novel is a witty portrayal of 19th century American life. This edition is illustrated by Worth Brehm, includes introductions by Percy Holmes Boynton and Bertha Evans Ward, and a biographical afterword." />
