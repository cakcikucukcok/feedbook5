      <meta name="description" content="In the Ice Age, mountains of ice grew where the ice did not melt, as more ice formed from the rains. Cave men  had to compete with all  animals for shelter and food. He depended on the ability of other creatures to survive.This made him one of the deadliest of animals. He showed no mercy. He kiled to borrow what he could not produce. Animals produce fur, to keep them warm. Man had to take the furs from animals to survive.  He also had to take their meat, bones, and innards. In Spring wild green things sprouted and grew. Man learned to sort and use these. Some leery, more careful people began to notice medical properties of these plants They remembered these properties. Soon others of the clan became dependent on these people who could remember what to use for this or that ailment. They became the Shaman. Their job became as important as the hunter. Salt became an important commodity in the later Ice Age. Man crave it.  If you had salt, you could trade it for meat, furs, and weapons.  But if they had nothing to trade, then they would revert to borrowing." />
