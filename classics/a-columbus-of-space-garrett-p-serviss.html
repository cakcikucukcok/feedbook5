  <title>A Columbus of Space - Garrett P. Serviss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Columbus of Space is a sci fi novel written by Garrett P. Serviss. Just as Christopher Columbus&amp;#39;s journeys to the new world changed human civilization forever, so too would the power to travel freely across the universe alter the parameters of our collective existence. Garrett P. Serviss&amp;#39;s tale of a group of intrepid explorers who harness what they call &amp;quot;inter-atomic energy&amp;quot; to travel from Earth to Venus is a fun, fast read.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Garrett P. Serviss (March 24, 1851 &amp;ndash; May 25, 1929) was an American astronomer, popularizer of astronomy, and early science fiction writer. Serviss was born in upstate New York and majored in science at Cornell University. He took a law degree at Columbia University but never worked as an attorney. Instead, in 1876 he joined the staff of the The New York Sun newspaper, working as a journalist until 1892 under editor Charles Dana.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Serviss showed a talent for explaining scientific details in a way that made them clear to the ordinary reader, leading Andrew Carnegie to invite him to deliver The Urania Lectures in 1894 on astronomy, cosmology, geology, and related matters. With Carnegie&amp;#39;s financial backing, these lectures were illustrated with magic lantern slides and other effects to show eclipses, presumed lunar landscapes, and much else. Serviss toured the United States for over two years delivering these lectures, then settled down to become a popular speaker in the New York area. He also wrote a syndicated newspaper column devoted to astronomy and other sciences and wrote frequently for the leading magazines of the day." />
