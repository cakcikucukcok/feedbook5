  <title>The Notting Hill mystery - Charles Warren Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Notting Hill mystery&quot; is a detective novel written by Charles Warren Adams  under the pseudonym of Charles Felix in 1863. Having enjoyed some critical  success at the time of its publication, it was totally forgotten and then  rediscovered in 2012, when the identity of its author was finally uncovered.  Preceding works by Wilkie Collins or Émile Gaboriau, &quot;The Notting Hill mystery&quot; is  now considered to be the first ever crime novel. This debate about who was first  hides the true value of the book. It was astonishingly ahead of its time. It is  a crime case presented as a collection of investigative, criminal, forensic  documents and multiple depositions. It is also the first example of a “perfect  crime” novel as at the end of the book the investigator has probably understood  the truth but has no evidence to support his conclusions.
