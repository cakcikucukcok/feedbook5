  <title>Her Hidden Truth (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Debra Webb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The mission was always top priority for a Specialist–except this assignment was personal for agent Vince Ferrelli. Though anyone would be hard-pressed to find a tougher operative, Vince had one vulnerability…Katrina Moore.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Kat&quot; had been fitted with a new memory implant to protect her identity while undercover. But the device had malfunctioned and put her in serious jeopardy. Only Vince could extract her from the demented organization…&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; she remembered the love she&#39;d shared with Vince–and not the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But pretending that they were a passionate couple would be torture for Vince. Because he still loved Kat. And he sure hoped she wouldn&#39;t kill him when this case was closed!&lt;/p&gt;
