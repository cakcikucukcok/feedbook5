          &lt;strong&gt;Can he leave the past behind?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He was a self-made millionaire, but it was his young son who mattered most to Blake Monroe. So when a beautiful teacher appeared on his rainy doorstep and immediately bonded with the boy, Blake hired Madeline Douglas on the spot. Under Madeline’s care, the child thrived. And in her presence, Blake’s defences crumbled…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But something ominous lurked along the foggy cliffs of this remote village. Was it the curse that had pervaded the town…or had Blake’s tortured past finally come back to haunt him?&lt;/p&gt;
