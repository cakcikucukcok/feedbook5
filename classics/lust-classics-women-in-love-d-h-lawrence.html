  <title>LUST Classics: Women in Love - D. H. Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;He lifted her, and seemed to pour her into himself, like wine into a cup (...) So she relaxed, and seemed to melt, to flow into him, as if she were some infinitely warm and precious suffusion filling into his veins, like an intoxicant.&quot;
The second novel about the Brangwen family, `Women in Love‘ (1920), narrows in on sisters Ursula and Gudrun, who, though very close, have a fiery relationship. As teachers at a grammar school they become involved with the school inspector, Rupert Birkin, and the wealthy son of a local colliery owner, Gerald Crich. What is not immediately apparent to them is the deep and complicated relationship between the two men. 
D.H. Lawrence wrote the character of Birking as a thinly disguised version of himself while author Katherine Mansfield was his inspiration behind the youngest sister Gudrun. In the well-received BBC miniseries from 2011, Gudrun was portrayed by award-winning actress Rosamund Pike.
