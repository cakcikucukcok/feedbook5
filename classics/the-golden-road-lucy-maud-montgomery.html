  <title>The Golden Road - Lucy Maud Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Golden Road is a 1913 novel by Canadian author L. M. Montgomery. This book is preceded by The Story Girl.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The plot is based around the character Beverley who remembers his childhood days with his brother Felix and friends and cousins Felicity, Cecily, Dan, Sara Stanley (the &amp;quot;Story Girl&amp;quot;), hired-boy Peter and neighbor Sara Ray. The children often played in their family&amp;#39;s orchard and had many adventures, even creating their own newspaper, called Our Magazine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More character development takes place in this novel than in its predecessor, and the reader is able to watch the children grow up; in particular, they are able to watch Sara Stanley leave the Golden Road of childhood forever. They also are able to see the beginnings of a relationship between Peter and Felicity, as chemistry between them starts to build; it also seems that Beverly and Sara Stanley are drawn to each other, but this is left undeveloped." />
