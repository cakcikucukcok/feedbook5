  <title>The Swan and Her Crew - George Christopher Davies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Swan And Her Crew - Or The Adventures Of Three Young Naturalists And Sportsmen On The Broads And Rivers Of Norfolk (1889) by George Christopher Davies .&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a story of sport and adventure, natural history and science, and the movers in it are three boys just like yourselves; and that you may understand the better what they did, I shall first describe the scene of their exploits. It is the eastern part of Norfolk, and no better place could be found as a field for the doings of three enterprising young naturalists and sportsmen. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;With the same feeling of pleasure which one experiences when one writes to an old friend, I commence to write this new book, which I hope will be read by many a boy friend. It is very pleasant to an author to feel that he has a large circle of acquaintances whom he has never seen, and who know him only through his books. It should be his aim and endeavour to extend that circle of friends, and to increase the good feeling which they bear towards him. Therefore, my dear boys, I hope that after reading this book which I now submit to your approval, you will conceive as affectionate a regard for me as I have for you.&amp;quot;" />
