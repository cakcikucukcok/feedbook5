  <title>Pygmalion and Three Other Plays - George Bernard Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="George Bernard Shaw is one of the most influential playwrights of the twentieth century. The collection &quot;Pygmalion and Three Other Plays&quot; contains his best works, which are known for their rapier wit, ideas of decency, and portrayal of human relationships. Shaw wanted his audiences to realize that people, regardless of race, gender, or class, were all human beings with the same needs as everyone else. &quot;Pygmalion&quot; is a modern retelling of the classic story of the same name. Professor Henry Higgins, a phonetician, tries to transform a lower-class cockney girl into a lady by teaching her to speak like a proper Englishwoman. What Higgins forgets, though, is that Eliza is a human being who only wants to be treated as such; in Higgins&#39; mind, Eliza is a fun wager, a test of his abilities. When he thinks that he has won and turned Eliza into a fine lady, he becomes lonely and misses her vivacious personality. &quot;Major Barbara,&quot; &quot;The Doctor&#39;s Dilemma,&quot; and &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; all deal with different themes, but each play contains a unique play of words, blending comedy with feeling and heart to create a story which will make a large impression on the audiences&#39; heart." />
