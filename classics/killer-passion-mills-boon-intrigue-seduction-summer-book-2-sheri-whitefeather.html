          &lt;strong&gt;Seduced by a forbidden man!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There was no way Alicia Greco could afford to get involved with any man right now, especially not Special Agent Griffin Malone. He’d come to Fiji to profile the serial killer who was stalking the island’s shining white beaches. She was his key witness.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And yet…there was something about the shadow-haunted profiler that she simply couldn’t resist. So she gave in to his seduction, and to a passion more searing, more intense, than anything she had ever dared to dream of – a passion that made her the ruthless killer’s next target.&lt;/p&gt;
