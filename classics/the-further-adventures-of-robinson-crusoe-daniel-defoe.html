  <title>The Further Adventures of Robinson Crusoe - Daniel Defoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (now more commonly rendered as &amp;quot;The Further adventures of Robinson Crusoe&amp;quot;) is a novel by Daniel Defoe, first published in 1719. Just as in its significantly more popular predecessor, Robinson Crusoe (1719), the first edition credits the work&amp;#39;s fictional protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author. It was published under the considerably longer original title: The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe; Being the Second and Last Part of His Life, And of the Strange Surprising Accounts of his Travels Round three Parts of the Globe. Although intended to be the last Crusoe tale, the novel is followed by non-fiction book involving Crusoe by Defoe entitled Serious Reflections During the Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe: With his Vision of the Angelick World (1720).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story is speculated to be partially based on Moscow embassy secretary Adam Brand&amp;#39;s journal detailing the embassy&amp;#39;s journey from Moscow to Peking from 1693 to 1695.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book starts with the statement about Crusoe&amp;#39;s marriage in England. He bought a little farm in Bedford and had three children: two sons and one daughter. Our hero suffered a distemper and a desire to see &amp;quot;his island.&amp;quot; He could talk of nothing else, and one can imagine that no one took his stories seriously, except his wife. She told him, in tears, &amp;quot;I will go with you, but I won&amp;#39;t leave you.&amp;quot; But in the middle of this felicity, Providence unhinged him at once, with the loss of his wife.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the beginning of 1693, Crusoe made his nephew the commander of a ship. Around the beginning of January 1694, Crusoe and Friday went on board this ship in the Downs on the 8th, then arrived at Crusoe&amp;#39;s Island via Ireland. They discovered that the English mutineers left on the island by Crusoe a decade earlier had been making trouble, but that when the island fell under attack by cannibals the various parties on the island were forced to work together under truce to meet the threat. Crusoe takes various steps to consolidate leadership on the island and assure the civility of the inhabitants, including leaving a quantity of needed supplies, setting up a sort of rule of law under an honour system and ensuring cohabitating couples are married. He also leaves additional residents with necessary skills. On the way to the mainland once again from Crusoe&amp;#39;s island, the ship is attacked by the cannibals. Friday dies from three arrow shots during an attempt to negotiate, but the crew eventually wins the encounter without further serious casualty.&lt;br /&gt;
