  <title>The Innocence of Father Brown - G.K. Chesterton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Father Brown is a fictional Roman Catholic priest and amateur sleuth created in the early 20th century by English novelist G. K. Chesterton. Father Brown is featured in a series of 53 short stories where he solves mysteries and crimes using his intuition and keen understanding of human nature.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The character was loosely based by Chesterton on The Rt Rev. John Monsignor O&amp;#39;Connor (1870&amp;ndash;1952), a parish priest in Bradford, who was involved in Chesterton&amp;#39;s conversion to Catholicism in 1922. Chesterton portrays Father Brown as a short, stumpy Roman Catholic priest, with shapeless clothes, a large umbrella, and an uncanny insight into human evil. In &amp;quot;The Head of Caesar&amp;quot; he is &amp;quot;formerly priest of Cobhole in Essex, and now working in London&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He makes his first appearance in the story &amp;quot;The Blue Cross&amp;quot; and continues to appear throughout forty-eight short stories in five volumes, with two more stories discovered and published posthumously, often assisted in his crime-solving by the reformed criminal M. Hercule Flambeau. Father Brown also appears in a third story &amp;mdash; making a total of fifty-one &amp;mdash; that did not appear in the five volumes published in Chesterton&amp;#39;s lifetime, &amp;quot;The Donnington Affair&amp;quot;, which has a curious history. In the October 1914 issue of an obscure magazine, The Premier, Sir Max Pemberton published the first part of the story, then invited a number of detective story writers, including Chesterton, to use their talents to solve the mystery of the murder described. Chesterton and Father Brown&amp;#39;s solution followed in the November issue. The story was first reprinted in the Chesterton Review (Winter), 1981, pp. 1&amp;ndash;35 in the book Thirteen Detectives. Unlike the better-known fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, Father Brown&amp;#39;s methods tend to be intuitive rather than deductive.&amp;nbsp;" />
