          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;YOUR DAUGHTER IS NOT YOUR BIOLOGICAL CHILD.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Detective Mitch Halloran&#39;s words were enough to shatter a single mom&#39;s world. And as much as Stef Shelton wanted to fight his accusation and disprove his claim, the quest to locate her missing child proved as irresistible as the allure of Mitch&#39;s blond good looks. Wasn&#39;t he the last man she should trust? His investigation had destroyed the family she&#39;d worked so hard to create. But now, in spite of her fears, she&#39;d accepted his assistance in the search for her daughter. Did she dare submit to the beguiling comfort of his embrace?&lt;/p&gt;
