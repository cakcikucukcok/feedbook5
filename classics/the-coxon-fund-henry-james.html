  <title>The Coxon Fund - Henry James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Henry James examines one of his favorite topics&amp;mdash;the artist&amp;rsquo;s place in society&amp;mdash;by profiling a &amp;ldquo;genius&amp;rdquo; who just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to support himself. A dazzling intellectual and brilliant speaker, Mr. Saltram has become the most sought-after houseguest in England. But, as his intellectual labors slacken, it beomes harder and harder to get him to leave.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A wry, edgy comedy about the fine line between making art...and freeloading. The Coxon Fund shows off a gift that is rarely appreciated about Henry James: he can be wickedly funny.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Henry James, OM, son of theologian Henry James Sr., brother of the philosopher and psychologist William James and diarist Alice James, was an American-born author, one of the founders and leaders of a school of realism in fiction. He spent much of his life in England and became a British subject shortly before his death. He is primarily known for a series of major novels in which he portrayed the encounter of America with Europe. His plots centered on personal relationships, the proper exercise of power in such relationships, and other moral questions. His method of writing from the point of view of a character within a tale allowed him to explore the phenomena of consciousness and perception, and his style in later works has been compared to impressionist painting." />
