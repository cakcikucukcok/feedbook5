No, I guess my heart was always pretty good. I got a little asthma, maybe. Just a awful short breath when I was pitchin&amp;#39; hay last summer, dat&amp;#39;s all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well now, Rosicky, if you know more about it than I do, what did you come to me for? It&amp;#39;s your heart that makes you short of breath, I tell you. You&amp;#39;re sixty-five years old, and you&amp;#39;ve always worked hard, and your heart&amp;#39;s tired. You&amp;#39;ve got to be careful from now on, and you can&amp;#39;t do heavy work any more. You&amp;#39;ve got five boys at home to do it for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The old farmer looked up at the Doctor with a gleam of amusement in his queer triangular-shaped eyes. His eyes were large and lively, but the lids were caught up in the middle in a curious way, so that they formed a triangle. He did not look like a sick man. His brown face was creased but not wrinkled, he had a ruddy colour in his smooth-shaven cheeks and in his lips, under his long brown moustache. His hair was thin and ragged around his ears, but very little grey. His forehead, naturally high and crossed by deep parallel lines, now ran all the way up to his pointed crown. Rosicky&amp;#39;s face had the habit of looking interested,&amp;mdash;suggested a contented disposition and a reflective quality that was gay rather than grave. This gave him a certain detachment, the easy manner of an onlooker and observer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
