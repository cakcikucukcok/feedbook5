Although published anonymously, its authorship was revealed by the poet George Huddesford in what Burney called a "vile poem".<br /><b><i>Evelina - Wikipedia</i></b> | Frances Burney went on to write other books, but the spontaneity and light-heartedness of 'Evelina' set it apart. Yes, it deeply influenced Jane Austen and her much more famous books, but 'Evelina' can stand very well on its own two feet. It marked a turning of the tide, the opening of the door to a genre that we still can't get enough of.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Evelina (9780393002942): Burney, Frances: Books</i></b> | "Evelina, the first and best of Fanny Burney's novels, tells the story of a young girl, fresh from the provinces, whose initiation into the ways of the world is frequently painful, though it leads to self-discovery, moral growth, and finally, happiness. Hilarious comedy and moral gravity make the novel a fund of entertainment and wisdom.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Evelina - Frances Burney</a> </h3></p><hr/>
