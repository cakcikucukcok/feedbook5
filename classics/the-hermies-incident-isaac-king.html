  <title>The Hermies Incident - Isaac King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After years as a poster boy for space station children, Bill Smiths orderly life is turned inside out by events that defy rational reason. His natural pension for physical interaction with fellow crew members and his innate technical abilities are strained to the breaking point in his need to protect his sanity, if not his actual life. To overcome what appear to be impossible odds and a clear organized conspiracy at the highest levels of government, Bill and his nemesis, Juanita Alvarez, become entangled in a roller-coaster ride of stress and emotional involvement, bordering on a criminal conspiracy of their own. 
What appears to be wrong becomes right, what appears to be bad becomes good, and what appears to be legal becomes truly illegal. In this epic battle of right and wrong, our characters moral and physical strengths are tested to the breaking point. In the end, the never-ending struggle of all living things to exist and prosper is confirmed without regard for mankinds concept of right or wrong. Open the front cover, immerse yourself in the unfolding story, and pray for a revelation. I think you will find it very hard to put down." />
