  <title>The Story Girl - L. M. Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Story Girl said that once upon a time. Felix and I, on The May morning when we left Toronto for Prince Edward Island, had not Then heard her say it, and, indeed, were but barely aware of The existence of such a person as The Story Girl. We did not know her at all under that name. We knew only that a cousin, Sara Stanley, whose mother, our Aunt Felicity, was dead, was living down on The Island with Uncle Roger and Aunt Olivia King, on a farm adjoining The old King homestead in Carlisle. We supposed we should get acquainted with her when we reached There, and we had an idea, from Aunt Olivia&#39;s letters to faTher, that she would be quite a jolly creature. Further than that we did not think about her. We were more interested in Felicity and Cecily and Dan, who lived on The homestead and would Therefore be our roofmates for a season. But The spirit of The Story Girl&#39;s yet unuttered remark was thrilling in our hearts that morning, as The train pulled out of Toronto. We were faring forth on a long road; and, though we had some idea what would be at The end of it, There was enough glamour of The unknown about it to lend a wonderful charm to our speculations concerning it." />

It narrates the adventures of a group of young cousins and their friends who live in a rural community on Prince Edward Island, Canada. In 1917, Montgomery opined that The Story Girl was her favorite of the novels she had written by that time.<br /><b><i>The Story Girl - Wikipedia</i></b> | THE STORY GIRL By L. M. Montgomery Author of “Anne of Green Gables,” “Anne of Avonlea," “Kilmeny of the Orchard,” etc. With frontispiece and cover in colour by George Gibbs (not available in this file)<br /><b><i>The Story Girl, by L. M. Montgomery</i></b> | In the Story Girl and the Golden Road, LM Montgomery takes us to a lovely place indeed- her descriptions of Prince Edward Island make the reader want to be there, the tales the Story Girl tells us are charming as is the Story Girl herself, and as beautiful is that childhood that the book takes us to- at a time when children were perhaps more innocent than today but pleasures simpler and definitely much more fun.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Story Girl - L.
