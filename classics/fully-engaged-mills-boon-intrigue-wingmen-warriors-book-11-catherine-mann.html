  <title>Fully Engaged (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Wingmen Warriors, Book 11) - Catherine Mann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;They&#39;d shared one wild weekend of passion, then she&#39;d left without a word. Five years later, Nola Seabrook tracked down Captain Rick DeMassi to apologize for her hasty departure, not realizing this fresh encounter would lead to Rick moving in with her…as her bodyguard.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Playing protector to his ex-lover had not been Rick&#39;s plan. But disturbing letters and a nearly fatal car bomb soon had him jumping into action. He fully intended to protect Nola with his life, find out why she&#39;d been so quick to leave his bed…and do whatever was necessary to get her back in it.&lt;/p&gt;
