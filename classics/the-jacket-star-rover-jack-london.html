The Jacket is a rather different beast. A murderer languishes in solitary confinement, where, imprisoned in the strait-jacket, he learns to enter a death-like state and experience his numerous past lives.<br /><b><i>The Jacket (Star-Rover) - Kindle edition by London, Jack ...</i></b> | The Jack Rover tells the story of San Quentin death-row inmate Darrell Standing, who escapes the horror of prison life —and long stretches in a straitjacket— by withdrawing into vivid dreams of past lives, including incarnations as a French nobleman and an Englishman in medieval Korea.<br /><b><i>The Jacket (The Star-Rover)|Jack London.|Free download|PDF ...</i></b> | The Star Rover is unknown compared to Londons other works but this is an amazing book. A straight jacketed prisoner is brutalized and basicly left in the dark in solitary confinement, wills himself to learn astral projection, and relives past lives from previous incarnations. Very unique book that is unlike anything else Jack London wrote.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Jacket (Star-Rover) -  Jack London</a> </h3></p><hr/>
