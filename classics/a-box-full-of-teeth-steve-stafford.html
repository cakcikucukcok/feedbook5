  <title>A Box Full of Teeth - Steve Stafford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1989, jaded Special Operations veteran Phillip Rhyader joins the Peace Corps in an attempt to escape his past and to restore a sense of balance to his life.  Nine months later, 14 people are dead.  
Was it something he said?
A Box Full Of Teeth is the story of one mans journey to shed a life of violence and darkness, and find his second chance in a remote corner of the world.  
Although he arrives in Morocco with the best intentions, Phillips stay begins with a month-long, hashish-fueled patchwork of chaos and misadventure.  As he spirals out of control, an unexpected violent encounter jolts him into correcting his course.
As he settles into his new role as a rural third world schoolteacher, he finds himself surrounded by an odd assortment of friends:  The seductive and sophisticated daughter of his headmaster, a small group of young Muslim professors, and a tubercular prostitute, and an indigent, mentally unbalanced former political prisoner.
Much to his surprise, the pastoral existence Phillip had sought slowly takes shape.   But when a police raid ends with the disappearance of one of his students, Phillip makes the miscalculation of getting involved. His refusal to remain complacent sets into motion a chain of events that ultimately force him to choose between keeping his new life, or fighting  and perhaps killing  to protect those around him.
A Box Full Of Teeth is an unforgettable story that intertwines two very different worlds  US Special Forces and US Peace Corp  into a story of despair, tragedy and forgiveness.  Told in a stark, compelling voice, it vividly paints a picture of the Arab world that few have seen, and leaves the reader with a touching tale of love and loss." />
