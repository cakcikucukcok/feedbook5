  <title>The Outcry -  Henry James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;The Outcry&amp;quot;, Henry James&amp;#39;s final novel, is an effervescent comedy of money and manners. A popular success in its own day, but long unavailable since and now almost unknown, &amp;quot;The Outcry&amp;quot; is one of the most surprising and amusing of James&amp;#39;s works. Here he explores questions of privilege and initiative, repute and honour, high art and base calculation, revisiting some of his favourite themes with a deft and winning touch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Breckenridge Bender, a very rich American with a distinct resemblance to J.P. Morgan, arrives in England with the purpose of acquiring some very great art; he is directed to Dedborough, the estate of the debt-ridden Lord Theign. But plutocrat and aristocrat come into unexpected conflict when a young connoisseur, out to establish his own reputation, declares a prize painting from the lord&amp;#39;s collection to be in fact an even rarer, and pricier, work than had been thought." />
