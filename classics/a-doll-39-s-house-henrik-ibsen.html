      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On Christmas Eve, Nora and Torvald Helmer host unexpected guests: Nora’s friend Kristine, Dr. Rank, a close family friend, and Krogstad, an employee at Torvald’s bank. As the Helmers contend with their guests’ hidden agendas and deceits in their own marriage, Nora is forced to confront her husband’s true selfish nature and acknowledge what she truly desires from life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Written in 1879, Henrik Ibsen’s &lt;em&gt;A Doll’s House&lt;/em&gt; was scandalous for its criticism of nineteenth-century marriage and the constraints on women’s identities in the male-dominated society of the time. &lt;em&gt;A Doll’s House&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most performed stage plays in the world, and has also been adapted for film.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HarperPerennial Classics brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms.
