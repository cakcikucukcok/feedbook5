  <title>A Personal Record - Joseph Conrad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Personal Record is an autobiographical work (or &amp;quot;fragment of biography&amp;quot;) by Joseph Conrad.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It has also been published under the titles A Personal Record: Some Reminiscences and Some Reminiscences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Notoriously unreliable and digressive in structure, it is nonetheless the principal contemporary source for information about the author&amp;#39;s life. It tells about his schooling in Russian Poland, his sailing in Marseille, the influence of his Uncle Tadeusz, and the writing of Almayer&amp;#39;s Folly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It provides a glimpse of how Conrad wished to be seen by his British public, as well as being an atmospheric work of art.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &amp;quot;Familiar Preface&amp;quot; Conrad wrote for it includes the often quoted lines:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Those who read me know my conviction that the world, the temporal world, rests on a few very simple ideas; so simple that they must be as old as the hills. It rests notably, among others, on the idea of Fidelity.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Conrad wrote a new &amp;#39;Author&amp;#39;s Note&amp;#39; to A Personal Record for the Doubleday collected edition of his works (published in 1920) in which he discussed his friendship with the British colonial official and writer Hugh Clifford." />
