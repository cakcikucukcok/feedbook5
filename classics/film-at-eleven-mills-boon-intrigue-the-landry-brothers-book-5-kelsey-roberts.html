        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;WHEN EVERYONE IS WATCHING…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An impromptu appearance on Montana&#39;s favorite morning talk show to promote her new book turned Dr. Molly Jameson&#39;s quiet life upside down. And now the brainy beauty had become a media-savvy serial killer&#39;s next target. Even worse, Montana&#39;s golden boy, the infuriatingly handsome–and very off-limits–anchorman, Chandler Landry, was the only one she could turn to for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though a string of suspicious accidents proved Molly was in terrible danger, forging an intensely passionate relationship with Chandler seemed more frightening than being found by the madman who wanted her dead. But would Molly&#39;s fleeting fifteen minutes of harrowing fame lead to a permanent future together with Chandler…or lead her straight to a killer?&lt;/p&gt;
