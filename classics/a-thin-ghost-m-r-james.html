  <title>A Thin Ghost - M.R. James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you the type who loves nothing more than curling up with a book of ghost stories? If so, be sure to add A Thin Ghost and Others to your must-read list. A gem from the golden age of Gothic horror, these spine-tingling tales will satisfy your craving for ghoulishly top-notch fiction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
M.R. James (1 August 1862 &amp;ndash; 12 June 1936) was an English author, medievalist scholar and provost of King&amp;#39;s College, Cambridge (1905&amp;ndash;18), and of Eton College (1918&amp;ndash;36).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though James&amp;#39;s work as a medievalist is still highly regarded, he is best remembered for his ghost stories, which are regarded as among the best in the genre. James redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal Gothic clich&amp;eacute;s of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings. However, James&amp;#39;s protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests. Accordingly, he is known as the originator of the &amp;quot;antiquarian ghost story&amp;quot;." />

James's ghost stories were written to be read aloud as Christmas Eve entertainment to select gatherings of friends at Cambridge. They were subsequently published as: Ghost Stories of an Antiquary, More Ghost Stories of an Antiquary, A Thin Ghost and Others, and A Warning to the Curious .This site is devoted to the understated master of ghastliness, Montague Rhodes James OM MA.<br /><b><i>www.thin-ghost.org</i></b> | In A Thin Ghost and Others (1919), M R James lays aside most of his usual medieval props and builds his horrors, like LeFanu, his mentor, in 18th and 19th century settings. Unlike his earlier tales, James' later fiction fiddles with complex narrations drawn from multiple sources and also delves into the queasy world of dreams and second sight.<br /><b><i>A Thin Ghost and Others by M.R.
