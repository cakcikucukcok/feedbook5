          &lt;strong&gt;Her orders had come straight from the Pentagon - safeguard Dr. Hawk Lemay at all costs.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The renowned expert on nuclear fusion was being targeted by a hired gun because he was on the verge of a breakthrough that could impact the balance of power in the world. Emotional attachments had never interfered with Captain Sarah Fox&#39;s sworn duty before, but this bodyguard assignment had its她bstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the strikingly handsome scientist was as determined to protect her as she was to protect him, and Sarah had no ammunition against the brilliant blue gaze that shot straight through her heart. Yet, in the throes of danger, this Delta Force commando would risk it all for love - including facing a firing squad on Hawk&#39;s behalf!&lt;/p&gt;
