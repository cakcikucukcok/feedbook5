  <title>Exiles - James Joyce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Though his catalogue is relatively small, given his impact on modern literature, James Joyce is considered one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century. He was born in Dublin, Ireland, but lived his life in a sort of self-imposed exile, only returning on seldom occasions for short visits. He is noted for his incredibly unique style, his work &quot;Finnegan&#39;s Wake&quot; defying the boundaries of all conventional literary genres. His innovation of the stream-of-consciousness narrative influenced literary giants like Virginia Woolf and William Faulkner. It is said that no other writer in his time demolished as many boundaries in literature as Joyce. &quot;Exiles&quot; is his only play, which he wrote in the midst of composing &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; and &quot;Ulysses.&quot; Joyce noted Henrik Ibsen and his last play &quot;When We Dead Awaken&quot; as major influences. He described the play itself as &quot;three cat and mouse acts,&quot; a story that chronicles a group of people trying to come to grips with reconciling idealistic principles with their own passions." />
