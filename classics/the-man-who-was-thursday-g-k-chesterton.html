  <title>The Man Who Was Thursday - G. K. Chesterton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1908, G. K. Chesterton’s “The Man Who Was Thursday” has been described as a metaphysical thriller. It is the story of Gabriel Syme, who is recruited by Scotland Yard as part of an anti-anarchist task force. When he meets Lucian Gregory, a poet and member of a secret society of anarchists, he gains access to the underground movement. The group is lead by a central council of seven men, each named for a day of the week. Gabriel convinces the local chapter to elect him to the vacant position of “Thursday” and he soon discovers that he is not the only one pretending to be something that he is not. What follows is one of the most absurd and clever plots to ever have been written, one in which Chesterton’s wonderfully high-spirited prose carries the reader along in a boisterous rush. Arguably the author’s finest work, certainly his most popular, “The Man Who Was Thursday” is a wild, mad, hilarious and profoundly moving tale that ultimately defies classification. This edition includes a biographical afterword." />
