And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness. Man doth not yield himself to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.<br /><b><i>Ligeia by Edgar Allan Poe</i></b> | Ligeia is a short story written by Edgar Allan Poe and first published in 1838.
