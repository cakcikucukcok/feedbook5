  <title>The Three Musketeers (with an Introduction by J. Walker McSpadden) - Alexandre Dumas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First serialized between March and July of 1844, Alexandre Dumas’s “The Three Musketeers” is one of the author’s most famous works, the opening installment in the “d&#39;Artagnan Romances.” A timeless tale of adventure, romance, intrigue, and revenge, it is the captivating story of d’Artagnan, a young man of Gascony, who is determined to become a Musketeer of the Royal Guard. Through his wit and skill with a sword, he befriends the other Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Together they must foil the nefarious plotting of Cardinal Richelieu against the King and Queen, despite his appearance as an ally. The Musketeers must also overcome the villainous machinations of Milady de Winter, whose lethal criminality threatens those in power and the love of d’Artagnan for Constance Bonacieux. Dumas’s classic story has enthralled readers with its fast-paced action, endearing characters, and romantic ideals ever since its original publication. The camaraderie of the Musketeers has been forever immortalized by their famous motto “one for all, all for one.” This edition includes an introduction by J. Walker McSpadden." />
