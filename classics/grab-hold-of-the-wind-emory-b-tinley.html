  <title>Grab Hold of the Wind - Emory B. Tinley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am currently retired from full-time work, but I am a freelance musician at this time. My early involvement into the art and culture groomed me for the involvement in writing this playbook. 
I have been a singer, actor, musician, songwriter, etc.
I am an active senior citizen and the playbook has been my personal project.
I wrote this playbook while I was working two jobs6 days and 5 nights weekly.
Believe it or not, I wrote this back in 1972 and today it is very much still going on.
I knew people involved whether young and old alike. I have seen the good and the bad. What I have written are the things that have gone on and still going on today, even more people involved from top to bottom. 
Parts of the playbook are realistic today because of others like me who are trying to reach out to save as many of our young people as possible.
We are involved in youth programs so we have an edge in talking to them and to keep them aware of all the pitfalls. 
I hope to produce the play in our community with the youth group and others who may be interested. 
We want to let them know there is still hope and the younger people will have a big part to play while others like oversee their efforts. It wont be easy but we have to try to Grab Hold of the Wind." />
