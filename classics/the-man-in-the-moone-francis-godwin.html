  <title>The Man in the Moone - Francis Godwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Man in the Moone&quot; is a novel by Francis Godwin probably written in the  1620s and published for the first time under the pseudonym of Domingo Gonsales  after his death in 1638. The Man in the Moone can be considered as one of the  major works of the late English Renaissance. Its influence over future utopian,  picaresque and science-fiction writers is major. In this fascinating book, a  Spaniard flees following a duel, is stranded in Saint-Helens on his return home  from the East Indies, and then escapes the British fleet off Tenerife through a  gansa-propelled flying-machine which he had designed himself. He rises to the  sky, and twelve days later, he lands on the Moone. He discovers the lunar  society and then leaves, and arrives in China. Part picaresque, part utopia,  part science-fiction, discover this remarkable book with an original preface and  biography in this new edition by Les Éditions de Londres.&lt;/p&gt;" />
