        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;One man will go to any lengths when a vulnerable woman and her little boy are threatened&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;County prosecutor Dalton Hale is convinced widowed Briar Blackwood has information that can help him take down a local crime organization. Getting it is no easy task, though, considering the distrust in the Bitterwood police officer&#39;s beautiful gray eyes. But since he started his investigation, Briar and her tiny son have been attacked twice. The only solution is to move her and Logan into his home, where he can ensure their safety. However, neither Dalton nor Briar is prepared for the deepening feelings between them. Playing house is one thing, but when Briar&#39;s son is kidnapped Dalton recognizes he wants the real deal–and will put his own life on the line to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
