  <title>You Know Me Al - Ring Lardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the early decades of the twentieth century, newspaperman and humorist Ring Lardner (1885&amp;#8211;1933) made America laugh with his hilarious depictions of odd characters in the sporting world, Tin Pan Alley, and Hollywood. His first great success was &lt;I&gt;You Know Me Al, &lt;/I&gt;a fictional series of letters from a popular baseball hero to his friend, slyly revealing the letter writer as a crude, conceited, semiliterate, self-deceiving boob.&lt;BR&gt;The letters, created while Lardner was writing a sports column for &lt;I&gt;The Chicago Tribune,&lt;/I&gt; first appeared in &lt;I&gt;The Saturday Evening Post&lt;/I&gt; and were later published in book form in 1918. &lt;I&gt;You Know Me Al &lt;/I&gt;reveals Lardner as a satirical master at the peak of his form: a fine albeit misanthropic storyteller with a superb feel for the niceties of characters and speech and a sure instinct for provoking laughter.&lt;BR&gt;" />
