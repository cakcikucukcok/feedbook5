  <title>The Monster and Other Stories - Stephen Crane, Dover Thrift Editions</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The harrowing title tale from this collection recounts the experiences of an African-American coachman who becomes horribly disfigured after rescuing his employer&#39;s son from a fire. A study of race and tolerance as well as the challenges posed by deformity, this major work by the author of &lt;I&gt;The Red Badge of Courage&lt;/I&gt; originally appeared in 1898. The last of Stephen Crane&#39;s work to be published in his lifetime, the story was rediscovered in the mid-twentieth century and acclaimed by Ralph Ellison as &quot;one of the parents of the modern American novel.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;This volume also features two additional short stories by Crane: &quot;The Blue Hotel,&quot; in which a nervous visitor is led astray by his own preconceptions about the Wild West, and &quot;His New Mittens,&quot; the touching tale of a little boy who allows himself to be goaded into a snowball fight and attempts to outrun his mistake.&lt;BR&gt;" />
