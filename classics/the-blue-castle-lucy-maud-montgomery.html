  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Blue Castle - Lucy Maud Montgomery</i></b> | The Blue Castle is a 1926 novel by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery, best known for her novel Anne of Green Gables. The story takes place prior to World War I in the fictional town of Deerwood, located in the Muskoka region of Ontario, Canada. Deerwood is based on Bala, Ontario, which Montgomery visited in 1922. Maps of the two towns show similarities. This novel is considered one of L.M. Montgomery's few adult works of fiction, along with A Tangled Web, and is the only book she wrote that i<br /><b><i>The Blue Castle - Wikipedia</i></b> | Maud Montgomery never wrote anything to match her delightful debut novel, "Anne of Green Gables", but of the others I've read this and "Jane of Lantern Hill" are by far the next best. The story of "The Blue Castle" is original and quite adult (illegitimate babies, for heaven's sakes!) and characters reasonably three-dimensional.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: The Blue Castle (9788087830284): Montgomery, L ...</i></b> | Typically, L.M. Montgomery's books are marketed here in Canada as children's fiction, but The Blue Castle is one of many novels she has written which shows that she was just as great at more mature writing.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Blue Castle - Lucy Maud Montgomery</a> </h3></p><hr/>
