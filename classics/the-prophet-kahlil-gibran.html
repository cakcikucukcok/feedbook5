  <title>The Prophet - Kahlil Gibran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Prophet&lt;/strong&gt; is a book of 26 poetic essays written in English in 1923 by the Lebanese-American artist, philosopher and writer Khalil Gibran. In the book, the prophet Almustafa who has lived in the foreign city of Orphalese for 12 years is about to board a ship which will carry him home. He is stopped by a group of people, with whom he discusses many issues of life and the human condition. The book is divided into chapters dealing with love, marriage, children, giving, eating and drinking, work, joy and sorrow, houses, clothes, buying and selling, crime and punishment, laws, freedom, reason and passion, pain, self-knowledge, teaching, friendship, talking, time, good and evil, prayer, pleasure, beauty, religion, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kahlil Gibran&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;was a Lebanese-American artist, poet, and writer, born in 1883 in Lebanon and died in New York in 1931. As a young man he emigrated with his family to the United States where he studied art and began his literary career. In the Arab world, Gibran is regarded as a literary and political rebel. His romantic style was at the heart of a renaissance in modern Arabic literature, especially prose poetry, breaking away from the classical school. In Lebanon, he is still celebrated as a literary hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his early teens, the artistry of Gibran&amp;#39;s drawings caught the eye of his teachers and he was introduced to the avant-garde Boston artist, photographer, and publisher Fred Holland Day, who encouraged and supported Gibran in his creative endeavors. A publisher used some of Gibran&amp;#39;s drawings for book covers in 1898, and Gibran held his first art exhibition in 1904 in Boston. In 1908, Gibran went to study art with Auguste Rodin in Paris for two years. He later studied art in Boston. While most of Gibran&amp;#39;s early writing was in Arabic, most of his work published after 1918 was in English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is chiefly known in the English-speaking world for his 1923 book &amp;#39;The Prophet&amp;#39;, an early example of inspirational fiction including a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose. The book sold well despite a cool critical reception, gaining popularity in the 1930s and again especially in the 1960s counterculture. Gibran is the third best-selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Lao-Tzu.&lt;/p&gt;" />
