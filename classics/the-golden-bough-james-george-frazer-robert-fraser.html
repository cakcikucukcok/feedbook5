  <title>The Golden Bough - James George Frazer, Robert Fraser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A classic study of the beliefs and institutions of mankind, and the progress through magic and religion to scientific thought, The Golden Bough has a unique status in modern anthropology and literature.
First published in 1890, The Golden Bough was eventually issued in a twelve-volume edition (1906-15) which was abridged in 1922 by the author and his wife.  That abridgement has never been reconsidered for a modern audience.  In it some of the more controversial passages were dropped, including Frazer&#39;s daring speculations on the Crucifixion of Christ.  For the first time this one-volume edition restores Frazer&#39;s bolder theories and sets them within the framework of a valuable
introduction and notes.
A seminal work of modern anthropolgy, The Golden Bough also influenced many twentieth-century writers, including D H Lawrence, T S Eliot, and Wyndham Lewis.  Its discussion of magical types, the sacrificial killing of kings, the dying god, and the scapegoat is given fresh pertinence in this new edition.
ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World&#39;s Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.
