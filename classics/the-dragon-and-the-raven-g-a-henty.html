  <title>The Dragon and the Raven - G. A. Henty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the reign of King Alfred, Danish forces have invaded the English countryside. Although the English try to repulse these attacks, they are overrun by the savagery and sheer numbers of the Danes. One of those deeply touched by these attacks is young Edmund. As a boy, he watched as his father was slain in battle fighting the Danes. Although young, he was intelligent, and noted the mistakes made on the battlefield. As he grew into a man, he put that knowledge into use and created a uniquely trained group of soldiers and built a new, stronger ship called the Dragon. Manning this ship with his special soldiers, Edmund joins the battle for freedom from Danish oppression. His adventures take him all throughout Europe and lead to glory, wealth, and eventually love." />

Like all Henty's books, this work aims at historical accuracy and reproduces the faith and concerns of the era. King Alfred is too little known today; his faith, and his reliance on God's law, make him of little interest to modern man.<br /><b><i>The Dragon and the Raven by G. A. Henty, Fiction ...</i></b> | The Dragon and the Raven is set in the period of King Alfred, where the Saxons were fighting against the Danes (the Vikings). It's got a lot of fighting scense, which are long and to be honest, kind of boring, but is quite an interesting read nonetheless.<br /><b><i>The Dragon and the Raven, or, The Days of King Alfred by G ...</i></b> | The Dragon and the Raven [G. A. Henty] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers.
