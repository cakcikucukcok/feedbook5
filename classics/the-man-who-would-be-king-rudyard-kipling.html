  <title>The Man Who Would Be King - Rudyard Kipling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The rugged mountains of 19th-century Afghanistan serve as the backdrop for this humorous and action-packed tale of two happy-go-lucky Britons who take over a remote kingdom.

&lt;br /&gt;
Kipling was one of the most popular writers in England, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Henry James said: &amp;quot;Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius (as distinct from fine intelligence) that I have ever known.&amp;quot; In 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and its youngest recipient to date.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Among other honours, he was sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and on several occasions for a knighthood, all of which he declined." />
