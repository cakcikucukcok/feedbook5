  <title>Dating Can Be Deadly (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Wendy Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Some gifts are easy to return–like parrot earrings from Aunt Ruth–but when your gift is clairvoyance, Tabitha Emery finds there is a definite No Refund Policy. She has visions of black magic rituals and dismembered bodies, and she&#39;s not sure what to do. She didn&#39;t ask for this talent, but it clings to her like a thong and is just as uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her goals are simple: A) to rise above law office receptionist B) to spend Friday nights uncovering the mysteries of butterscotch schnapps with her comrades, and C) to get more than a passing glance from Clay Sanderson (Greek-god-type lawyer).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But her sight has turned life upside down–and she finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation where the only clues are in her premonitions–making her not only key to solving the mystery but a suspect. (On the plus side: she could use legal advice, so she and Clay have something to talk about.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And somewhere is the real culprit, who wants this clairvoyant dead…&lt;/p&gt;
