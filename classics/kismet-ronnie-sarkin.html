  <title>Kismet - Ronnie Sarkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sarkins unique 2-in-1 debut novel offers readers the experience to read about two lovers in a refreshing way. The stories not only alternate chapter-to-chapter from Fey and Adam in the 1200s and Kevan and ine in the 1700s, they are also juxtaposed split narratives.
Its 1238 in Carran County Clare Ireland and April is burnt at the stake for being a pagan priestess. Her little daughter Fey watches from the crowd, now an orphan. Fate would have it that Fey is adopted by the Reddan family whose son Adam falls deeply in love with her. Adams desire to protect and cherish Fey is threatened by the arrival in Carran of her estranged cousin Sylvan. Adam is extremely concerned. Will Sylvan lead Fey down the same dangerous path that ended her mothers life. Is this her Kismet, her destiny?
Five centuries later Fey and Adam incarnate together as Kevan and ine again in Ireland, which is now occupied by the English. Kevan becomes embroiled in the rebellion and is all consumed with their fight to evict their oppressors. He ignores the danger he is in, leaving ine worried about what their destiny will hold.
A story where misunderstandings are repeated, violence perpetuated and undying love threads its way across centuries. Lessons to be learned questioning our all too often superficial perception of life with insights into living during those historical times.
For deeper meanings including insights into karma and reincarnation hidden in the story, see the Authors web site www.feyslamentation.com" />
