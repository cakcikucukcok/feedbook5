  <title>The Awkward Age - Henry James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Originally conceived as a brief, light story about the complications created in her family&amp;#39;s social set by a young girl coming of age, the novel expanded into a general treatment of decadence and corruption in English fin de si&amp;egrave;cle life. James presents the novel almost entirely in dialogue, an experiment that adds to the immediacy of the scenes but also creates serious ambiguities about characters and their motives.&lt;br /&gt;
Henry James, OM (15 April 1843 &amp;ndash; 28 February 1916) was an American writer who spent most of his writing career in Britain. He is regarded as one of the key figures of 19th-century literary realism. He was the son of Henry James, Sr. and the brother of philosopher and psychologist William James and diarist Alice James.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He is best known for a number of novels showing Americans encountering Europe and Europeans. His method of writing from a character&amp;#39;s point of view allowed him to explore issues related to consciousness and perception, and his style in later works has been compared to impressionist painting. His imaginative use of point of view, interior monologue and unreliable narrators brought a new depth to narrative fiction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
James contributed significantly to literary criticism, particularly in his insistence that writers be allowed the greatest possible freedom in presenting their view of the world. James claimed that a text must first and foremost be realistic and contain a representation of life that is recognizable to its readers. Good novels, to James, show life in action and are, most importantly, interesting.&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to his voluminous works of fiction he published articles and books of travel, biography, autobiography, and criticism, and wrote plays. James alternated between America and Europe for the first twenty years of his life; eventually he settled in England, becoming a British subject in 1915, one year before his death. James was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911, 1912, and 1916." />

Originally conceived as a brief, light story about the complications created in her family's social set by a young girl coming of age, the novel expanded into a general treatment of decadence and corruption in English fin de siècle life.<br /><b><i>The Awkward Age - Wikipedia</i></b> | If you have never read any Henry James before then please, please don't start with this book. Of all his books this has to be the most ambiguous, after all we can take the 'awkward age' as that being the age where young Nanda is at, but also it could relate to most of the characters, and even to the age itself (the end of the 19th Century).<br /><b><i>The Awkward Age: James, Henry: 9781519382757: Amazon.com ...</i></b> | His first play had proved a failure and James the great novelist turned his mind back to fiction.
