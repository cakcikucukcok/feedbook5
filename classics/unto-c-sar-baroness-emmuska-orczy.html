  <title>Unto Cæsar - Baroness Emmuska Orczy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="HE LOVED HER AND HE LOVED ROME!&lt;br /&gt;
Taurus Antinor loved her, that she knew. The last four days had made a woman of her: she had tasted of and witnessed every passion that rends a human heart, love, ambition, cruelty, hatred! The man whom she loved, loved her with an intensity at least equal to that which even now made her heart throb at the memory of his kiss. He loved her, longed for her, would have laid down his life for her even at the moment when he tore himself away from her arms.&lt;br /&gt;
BUT TAURUS ANTINOR HAD A GREATER LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;
Dea Flavia was like a goddess of love in Classical Rome. Beautiful, young and rich, she was worshipped by men and envied by women. But then she met the handsome and mysterious Taurus Antinor &amp;mdash; and his mission.&lt;br /&gt;
And her life changed forever.&lt;br /&gt;
Could she survive the blood-crazed politics of Rome? Could she fend off the advances of a mad emperor called &amp;mdash; Caligula?" />
