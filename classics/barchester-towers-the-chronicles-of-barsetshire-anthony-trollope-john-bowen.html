  <title>Barchester Towers: The Chronicles of Barsetshire - Anthony Trollope, John Bowen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mr Slope flattered himself that he could out-manoeuvre the lady...he did not doubt of ultimate triumph.Barchester Towers (1857) was the book that made Trollopes reputation and it remains his most popular and enjoyable novel.  The arrival of a new bishop in Barchester, accompanied by his formidable wife and ambitious chaplain, Obadiah Slope, sets the town in turmoil as Archdeacon Grantly declares War, war, internecine war! on Bishop Proudie and his supporters. Who will come out on top in the battle between the archdeacon, the bishop, Mr Slope, and Mrs Proudie?The livelihood of Mr Harding, the saintly hero of The Warden, is once more under threat but clerical warfare finds itself tangled up in the wayward (and sometimes perverse) desires of the many courtships, seductions, and romances of the book.  Who will marry Eleanor Bold?  Can any man resist the charms of the exotically beautiful La Signora Madeline Vesey Neroni? Will the oily Mr Slope finally get his comeuppance?  Trollopes matchless handling of plot and character displays a skillwhose distinctive literary qualities are celebrated in this new edition.ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford Worlds Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.
