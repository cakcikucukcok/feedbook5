  <title>Aphra Behn: Complete Novels - Aphra Behn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aphra Behn (1640-1689) was a spy for Charles II, a playwright, poet, and novelist, and the first English woman to make a living from writing. Her pen name was Astrea.
Ernest A. Baker (1869-1941) was an English writer and historian of literature. In 1905, 216 years after Mrs Behn&#39;s death, he introduced this collection of ten of her novels in the language of his day, a form which was not a facsimile of her texts. This ebook, prepared 329 years after her death, silently corrects some typos, and makes further changes. The Introduction and three of the stories contain many poems.
The ten stories are: Oronooko, The Fair Jilt, The Nun, Agnes de Castro, The Lover&#39;s Watch, The Case for the Watch, The Lady&#39;s Looking Glass, The Lucky Mistake, The Court of the King of Bantam, and, The Adventure of the Black Lady." />
