  <title>Whisper of the Worms - Marcardian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A crow-eyed peep into the backyard of a banking organization.
An unusual portrayal of the life and times of an ordinary mortal and his subdued fight for survival
Listen to the whisper of the worms to hear the muffled wail of humans on the run, lured by the carrot, forced by the stick
An unbalnced account of gagged sentimentssubtly unfolding the naivety of petty minds. Also of nepotism and dehumanized value systems
A moving story of the commercialized people in an imaginary country called Marcardia, portrayed brilliantly through their psyche and polity. Makes one think, laugh and get emotionally chocked.
Blended finely into the main fabric are vivid shots of rustic life lifted out of a fading frame; sweet smell of paddy fields on blossomrhythmic splash of the wooden bucket in the farm well" />
