  <title>Short Stories by Virginia Woolf - Virginia Woolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Such an expression of unhappiness was enough by itself to make one&#39;s eyes slide above the paper&#39;s edge to the poor woman’s face—insignificant without that look, almost a symbol of human destiny with it. Life&#39;s what you see in people&#39;s eyes; life&#39;s what they learn, and, having learnt it, never, though they seek to hide it, cease to be aware of—what? That life&#39;s like that, it seems. Five faces opposite—five mature faces—and the knowledge in each face. Strange, though, how people want to conceal it! Marks of reticence are on all those faces: lips shut, eyes shaded, each one of the five doing something to hide or stultify his knowledge. One smokes; another reads; a third checks entries in a pocket book; a fourth stares at the map of the line framed opposite; and the fifth—the terrible thing about the fifth is that she does nothing at all." />
