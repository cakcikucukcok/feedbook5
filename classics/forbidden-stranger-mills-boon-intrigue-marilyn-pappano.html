        &lt;p&gt;Exotic dancer Amanda was planning to retire her stilettos for a new life. Then Rick Calloway sauntered into the club she worked in and took her breath away. The darkly handsome new bartender had a connection to her past and secrets of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Working undercover to investigate the disappearances of several dancers, sexy cop Rick should have remained focused on the case, not Amanda. Or so he told himself. Their mutual attraction was dangerously inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But maybe it was what they both needed to live through another night…&lt;/p&gt;
