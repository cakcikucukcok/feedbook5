  <title>Bounty Hunter&#39;s Woman (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Broken Arrow Ranch, Book 4) - Linda Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Born-and-bred Londoner Priscilla Wyatt was shocked at how much she loved the Colorado ranch mysteriously bequeathed to her family.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But enemies were determined to drive the Wyatts away–and innocent Priscilla was their next pawn. Donovan Jones made it his mission to find his man–or woman–at any cost, but retrieving Priscilla from her abductors was just the first hurdle. Now he had to keep his feisty charge safe.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even the solitary Donovan couldn&#39;t help but be captivated by his one-of-a-kind client as they evaded their foes. Before long, the bounty hunter was in danger of stealing her heart…and losing his own!&lt;/p&gt;
