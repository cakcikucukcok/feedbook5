  <title>The Toilers of the Sea - Victor Hugo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1866, Hugo&#39;s story unfolds the life of a reclusive fisherman, Gilliat, who lives on the Isle of Guernsey, where Hugo himself was exiled for a large portion of his life. When Gilliat becomes a young man, he falls in love with Déruchette, the beautiful niece of wealthy ship-owner Lethierry. When Lethierry&#39;s steamship mysteriously runs aground, Déruchette, who is in love with the new rector of the island, offers to marry the man who can recover the &#39;Durande&#39;. Gilliat sets off at once to free the ship, and his feats of ingenuity and strength create some of the most memorable descriptions to be found in a romantic novel. Although the least known of Hugo&#39;s masterpieces, this deliberately grandiose tale is by turns a sympathetic, richly detailed account of the hard work of seamanship and exhilarating action, as in the remarkable battle with the octopus. This irresistible novel, written with Hugo&#39;s considerable narrative skill, is both captivating and haunting to its ironic conclusion." />

The book is dedicated to the island of Guernsey, where Hugo spent 15 years in exile. Hugo uses the setting of a small island community to transmute seemingly mundane events into drama of the highest calibre.<br /><b><i>Toilers of the Sea - Wikipedia</i></b> | Victor Hugo's Les Miserables and The Hunchback of Notre Dame are two of the most famous books ever, but his other novels are obscure in English. The Toilers of the Sea is probably his next best known, and though less great than those immortal works, is another masterpiece.<br /><b><i>The toilers of the sea, : Hugo, Victor: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | Hugo’s writing style in The Toilers of the Sea is that of a meticulous literary master and not a mere storyteller. Because of his political activism against Louis-Napoleon, Hugo fled France in 1851 and “spent the next nineteen years in exile, most of them in the Channel Islands, first on Jersey and then on Guernsey” according to Robb.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Toilers of the Sea - Victor Hugo</a> </h3></p><hr/>
