          &lt;strong&gt;Rafe Cardoza was a government agent, a professional who knew better than to let his emotions get in the way.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But that was before duty brought him back into Daniela Fabrizio&#39;s life as suddenly as he had been forced to leave it twenty years before…. The boy she&#39;d once been forbidden to love was now the man responsible for Daniela&#39;s safety.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The single mom with a baby on the way wasn&#39;t sure what scared her more, the fact that someone wanted her dead…or that Rafe still wanted her. Was he ready to take on fatherhood, or would he walk away when his mission was accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;
