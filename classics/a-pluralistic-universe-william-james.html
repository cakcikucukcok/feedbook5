  <title>A Pluralistic Universe - William James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Craving an intellectually stimulating read? Dive into A Pluralistic Universe by William James, an influential thinker and psychologist who also happened to be the brother of acclaimed novelist Henry James. This lucid, gripping account outlines some of James&amp;#39; critiques of standard methods of reasoning. It&amp;#39;s definitely challenging, but much more appealing to a general audience than most philosophical tracts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
William James (January 11, 1842 &amp;ndash; August 26, 1910) was an American philosopher and psychologist who was also trained as a physician. The first educator to offer a psychology course in the United States, James was one of the leading thinkers of the late nineteenth century and is believed by many to be one of the most influential philosophers the United States has ever produced, while others have labeled him the &amp;quot;Father of American psychology&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Along with Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey, James is considered to be one of the major figures associated with the philosophical school known as pragmatism, and is also cited as one of the founders of functional psychology. A Review of General Psychology analysis, published in 2002, ranked James as the 14th most eminent psychologist of the 20th century. He also developed the philosophical perspective known as radical empiricism. James&amp;#39; work has influenced intellectuals such as Emile Durkheim, W. E. B. Du Bois, Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Hilary Putnam, and Richard Rorty, and has even influenced Presidents, such as Jimmy Carter." />
