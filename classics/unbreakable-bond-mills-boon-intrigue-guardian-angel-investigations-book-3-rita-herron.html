  <title>Unbreakable Bond (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Guardian Angel Investigations, Book 3) - Rita Herron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;For eight years Nina Nash has been told it&#39;s time she moved past the night that changed her life forever. But the sound of her baby&#39;s cries at night–and the intense feeling that her little girl is still alive when she&#39;s been led to believe otherwise–remain. Only, no one accepts her claims…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;except the one man who&#39;s determined to help her uncover the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Investigator Slade Blackburn takes Nina&#39;s case, hoping to finally give her some closure. But what she really needs is someone to trust, someone to protect her…someone to erase the sadness from her beautiful blue eyes. Their search for answers turns dangerous, and Slade vows he&#39;ll stop at nothing to ensure her survival survival–and reunite her with the child she and &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; is still out there.&lt;/p&gt;
