  <title>The Thirty Nine Steps (Illustrated) - John Buchan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Thirty Nine Steps,&lt;/i&gt; John Buchan&amp;rsquo;s groundbreaking espionage thriller featuring spy Richard Hannay, has been called the first great espionage novel. It has been embraced by each new generation and shows no sign of losing popularity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Richard Hannay arrives in London on the eve of World War I, where he meets an American agent seeking help in stopping a political assassination. Before long, Hannay finds himself in possession of a little black book that holds the key to the conspiracy &amp;mdash; and on the run from both the police and members of a mysterious organization that will stop at nothing to keep their secrets hidden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book has formed the basis for a number of film adaptations, notably: Alfred Hitchcock&amp;#39;s 1935 version; a 1959 color remake; a 1978 version which is perhaps most faithful to the novel; and a 2008 version for British television." />
