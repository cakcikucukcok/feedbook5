  <title>Tales from Shakespeare (illustrated by Arthur Rackham with an introduction by Alfred Ainger) - Charles And Mary Lamb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1807, “Tales from Shakespeare” is the classic retelling of Shakespeare’s plays by brother and sister duo Charles and Mary Lamb. All told twenty of Shakespeare’s plays are represented in this work. On what basis the two made their selection of tales is unknown, the English Histories are left unattempted, as well as the Roman Plays. Of the comedies only “Love’s Labour’s Lost” is omitted. As Alfred Ainger comments in his introduction “perhaps Miss Lamb felt how little would have remained of the original comedy when the poetical element in its language and the brilliant wit of its dialogue had been removed”. What is represented of Shakespeare’s plays is a magnificent retelling of some of his most popular works, ideal for introducing young readers to the brilliance of the Bard. As the two write in their preface “The following Tales are meant to be submitted to the young reader as an introduction to the study of Shakespeare,” so “that the true Plays of Shakespeare may prove to them in older years—enrichers of the fancy, strengtheners of virtue, a withdrawing from all selfish and mercenary thoughts, a lesson of all sweet and honourable thoughts and actions”. This edition includes an introduction by Alfred Ainger and illustrations by Arthur Rackham." />
