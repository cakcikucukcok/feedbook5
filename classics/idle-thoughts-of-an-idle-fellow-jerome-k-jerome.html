  <title>Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow - Jerome K. Jerome</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow is a collection of humorous essays by Jerome K. Jerome. It was the author&amp;#39;s second published book and it helped establish him as a leading English humorist. While widely considered one of Jerome&amp;#39;s better works, and in spite of using the same style as Three Men in a Boat, it was never as popular as the latter. A second &amp;quot;Idle Thoughts&amp;quot; book, The Second Thoughts of An Idle Fellow, was published in 1898.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The essays had previously appeared in Home Chimes, the same magazine that later serialised Jerome&amp;#39;s Three Men in a Boat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book consists of 14 independent articles arranged by themes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ON BEING IDLE.&lt;br /&gt;
ON BEING IN LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;
ON BEING IN THE BLUES.&lt;br /&gt;
ON BEING HARD UP.&lt;br /&gt;
ON VANITY AND VANITIES.&lt;br /&gt;
ON GETTING ON IN THE WORLD.&lt;br /&gt;
ON THE WEATHER.&lt;br /&gt;
ON CATS AND DOGS.&lt;br /&gt;
ON BEING SHY.&lt;br /&gt;
ON BABIES.&lt;br /&gt;
ON EATING AND DRINKING.&lt;br /&gt;
ON FURNISHED APARTMENTS.&lt;br /&gt;
ON DRESS AND DEPORTMENT.&lt;br /&gt;
ON MEMORY." />
