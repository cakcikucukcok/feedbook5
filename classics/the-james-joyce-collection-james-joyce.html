  <title>The James Joyce Collection - James Joyce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Joyce&amp;nbsp;was an Irish novelist, short story writer, poet, teacher, and literary critic. He contributed to the&amp;nbsp;modernist&amp;nbsp;avant-garde&amp;nbsp;and is regarded as one of the most influential and important authors of the 20th century. Joyce is best known for&amp;nbsp;Ulysses&amp;nbsp;(1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of&amp;nbsp;Homer&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;Odyssey&amp;nbsp;are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, most famously&amp;nbsp;stream of consciousness. Other well-known works are the short-story collection&amp;nbsp;Dubliners&amp;nbsp;(1914), and the novels&amp;nbsp;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&amp;nbsp;(1916) and&amp;nbsp;Finnegans Wake&amp;nbsp;(1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, his published letters and occasional journalism.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joyce was born in&amp;nbsp;Dublin&amp;nbsp;into a middle-class family. A brilliant student, he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run&amp;nbsp;O&amp;#39;Connell School&amp;nbsp;before excelling at the Jesuit schools&amp;nbsp;Clongowes&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Belvedere, despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father&amp;#39;s alcoholism and unpredictable finances. He went on to attend&amp;nbsp;University College Dublin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1904, in his early twenties, Joyce emigrated to continental Europe with his partner (and later wife)&amp;nbsp;Nora Barnacle. They lived in&amp;nbsp;Trieste,&amp;nbsp;Paris, and&amp;nbsp;Zurich. Although most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce&amp;#39;s fictional universe centres on Dublin and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there.&amp;nbsp;Ulysses&amp;nbsp;in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of&amp;nbsp;Ulysses, he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, &amp;quot;For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal.&amp;quot;" />
