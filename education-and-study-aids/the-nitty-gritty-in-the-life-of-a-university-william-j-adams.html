  <title>The Nitty-Gritty in the Life of a University - William J. Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An esteemed professor and one-time chairman of the mathematics department at New Yorks Pace
University, Adams, interested in all facets of university administration, has produced an almost Jeffersonian volume of correspondence from his tenure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
His views on textbook selection, collective bargaining and the proper role of the university have all flowed from his notebook, and no problem was too minute to evade his &lt;br&gt;scope 
The frivolity of some of these papers is balanced by Adamss opinions on weightier issues, including sexual harassment and compensation in higher education. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
His approach and forward manner on these situations, despite how genuine, sometimes engendered resentment from his fellow faculty. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But for those interested in the particulars of an academic career, this book offers a glimpse of what life may really be like inside the ivory tower.
