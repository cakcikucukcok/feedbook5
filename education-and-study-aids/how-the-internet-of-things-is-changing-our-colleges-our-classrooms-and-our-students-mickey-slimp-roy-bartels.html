  <title>How the Internet of Things is Changing Our Colleges, Our Classrooms, and Our Students - Mickey Slimp, Roy Bartels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;You have heard about the Internet of Things. You know that it is having an impact on higher education. So, what is it? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now that students have the entire computing power of 1975 in a pocket device, the college of the 2020s is entering a new educational age. For teens and tweens, the magic world of Harry Potter is all around. With a wave of a hand, they can control lights and surround themselves with music. In minutes, they can make a catalog of devices appear using a 3D printer. And now, they are ready to travel by driverless cars, summoned from a cellphone. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Embedded technology, that is, computing built into everyday devices, is all around. Known as the Internet of Things, embedded sensors in our home, in our tools, and even in our baseball bats have changed the world as we know it. As with every stage of evolution, leaders have the options to resist, adapt, or to get ahead of the change. &lt;/span&gt;" />
