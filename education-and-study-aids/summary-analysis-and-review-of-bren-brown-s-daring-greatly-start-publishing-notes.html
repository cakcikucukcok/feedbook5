  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review of Brené Brown’s Daring Greatly - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PLEASE NOTE: This is a key takeaways and analysis of the book and NOT the original book. 
Start Publishing Notes’ Summary, Analysis, and Review of Brené Brown’s Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead includes a summary of the book, review, analysis &amp; key takeaways, and detailed “About the Author” section. 
PREVIEW: In Daring Greatly, Brené Brown expands her over twelve years of academic research on the anatomy of connection into a 250+ page how-to on engaging more fully with ourselves and our world.  The title comes from a 1910 speech by Theodore Roosevelt, given at the Sorbonne after his presidency, about disavowing the non-participatory critics in favor of the man in the arena. Brown discusses where our fear of vulnerability comes from, why we protect ourselves, the price of disengagement, and owning and engaging with vulnerability to transform ourselves into better (if messier) beings.
Brown starts by introducing herself as a fifth generation Texan, born to family with a “lock and load” approach that did not mesh with emotional vulnerability.  She left corporate life and returned to school to be a social worker, but the research end—prediction, control—appealed to her more. During her doctoral process, she became a qualitative researcher, meaning the participants define the problem about the topic, and then the researcher develops a theory and sees where it fits in the existing literature (as opposed to proving/disapproving a hypothesis).  She studied shame and empathy, and developed a theory of shame resilience." />
