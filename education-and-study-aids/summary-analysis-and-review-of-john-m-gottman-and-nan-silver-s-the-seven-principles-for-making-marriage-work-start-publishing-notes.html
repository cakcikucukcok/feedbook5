  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review of John M. Gottman and Nan Silver’s The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PLEASE NOTE: This is a key takeaways and analysis of the book and NOT the original book. 
Start Publishing Notes’ Summary, Analysis, and Review of John M. Gottman and Nan Silver&#39;s The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work: A Practical Guide from the Country&#39;s Foremost Relationship Expert
includes a summary of the book, review, analysis &amp; key takeaways, and detailed “About the Author” section. 
PREVIEW: John Gottman and Nan Silver&#39;s The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work is a guide and workbook for assessing marriages and saving those that are in trouble. Based on Gottman&#39;s extensive research on marital happiness, the book provides an overview of what makes marriages successful, and concrete steps to improve relationships.
Gottman&#39;s research involves extensive observations of couples interacting, as well as lengthy interviews with men and women. Because of his lab work, Gottman is able to predict whether a couple will divorce by listening to them discuss a conflict for as little as 15 minutes while monitoring bodily functions, like heart rate. Successful couples are emotionally intelligent. That means that they work to defuse conflict and are able to recognize and appreciate each other&#39;s perspectives." />
