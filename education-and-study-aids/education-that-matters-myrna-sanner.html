  <title>Education That Matters - Myrna Sanner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Free public education has long been a core American value and privilege. Yet, teachers are burning out, families are fleeing the public schools and students, who cannot read and write are graduating from high school. The government constantly and consistently strives for quality education through mandates and reforms. Myrna Sanner calls quality education &lt;em&gt;Education That Matters&lt;/em&gt;. While reading &lt;em&gt;Education That Matters&lt;/em&gt;, you will learn:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 How public education can become quality education.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Why implementing and understanding the responsibilities of citizenship are essential components of quality education.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 How the troubling behavior of students is diminishing quality education.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Why English proficiency is imperative to the preservation of the American culture and quality education.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Why patriotism must be encouraged and appreciated in order to maintain democracy and The Constitution of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Why educating the heart and soul of every student is vital for quality education.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 How favorable role models in all walks of life can promote quality education.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clearly defined principles will offer consistency to teachers when educating students, to law enforcement officers when enforcing the laws and to families when raising their children. Teachers can recognize negative behavior, can teach the academics, and help eradicate illiteracy. They can even practice patriotism every day in the classroom. However, teachers do not go home with their students. Myrna Sanner addresses problems facing public schools and offers solutions for re-approaching American public education by being mindful of a few core tenets that speak to the hearts and souls of teachers and families. With the analysis, insight, and vision of the most troubling trends, &lt;em&gt;Education That Matters&lt;/em&gt; will perhaps be the most valuable and compelling education book of the year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
