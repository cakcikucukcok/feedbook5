  <title>Travel 101 - Andrew M. Yaracs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever thought to yourself I wish I knew then what I know now or hindsight is 20/20?  When I think back to the day that I began planning my first band trip those sentiments are true.  I wrote this book as a resource to help band directors who are interested in planning student travel opportunities.  While the main focus is on travel and performance with a marching band the information can be adapted and applied to almost any group whether youre an orchestra or choir director, classroom teacher or club advisor.  The content is a compilation of the things I learned through personal experience, networking with other band directors and dealing with several different travel companies over a fifteen year period from 1997 to 2012 as the director of the Butler High School Golden Tornado Marching Band in Butler, Pennsylvania.
Travel 101 is a comprehensive guide that will provide a step by step blueprint for planning and executing a safe and successful experience for your students.  The book covers a wide spectrum of travel related topics and is a valuable resource for either the novice or experienced group planner.   
Why travel?  What are the benefits of a travel program?  Youll get the answers to these and other questions as well as advice and guidance on: Getting Started, Applying for major events i.e. Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade and Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade, Choosing a Travel Company, Creating a Budget, Planning Your Itinerary, Making Transportation Choices i.e. Bus, Commercial or Charter Air, Fundraising, Managing Student Accounts, Safety and Security, Travel Dos and Donts, Liability Issues, Chaperones, Medical Concerns, Student Supervision, Dealing with Uniforms and Equipment, Public Relations, Meetings and Methods of Communication, Rooming Assignments, Packing Guidelines, Preparing for Your Performance, and Managing the Trip to name just a few.  In addition I have included a resource section in the back of the book with links to various travel and event websites, a major events list, information on several travel associations and several sample forms and letters you can adapt for your own use." />
