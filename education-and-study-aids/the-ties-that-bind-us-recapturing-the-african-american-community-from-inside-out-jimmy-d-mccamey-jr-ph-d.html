  <title>The Ties That Bind Us: Recapturing the African-American Community from Inside Out - Jimmy D. McCamey Jr. Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Writing a book can never be something that just happens. It takes time, dedication, and persistence to complete such a huge task. Being a full-time employee, business owner, father, uncle, mentor, friend, and so many other things to many, it would have not been possible to complete this task without the support of my family, friends, colleagues, and employees at the number of agencies, universities, and colleges I was afforded an opportunity to work with over the years. Each of you continued to inspire my writings and study of politics, social justice, community, education, African-American culture, and poverty issues. Finally, I give a special thanks to my two sons, Jimmy Dawson McCamey III and Jamey Lawson McCamey, who inspired me to write about black boys, black families, and the black community." />
