  <title>Playing with Logic 1 - Fausto Presutti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PLAY WITH LOGIC 1 is a teaching tool full of game exercises, that allows you to identify the psycho-cognitive skills of children and to develop their mental universe and their psychic world by:&lt;br /&gt;
- The structure and evolution of logical, intellectual and creative processes;&lt;br /&gt;
- The conceptualization of the incentive elements, spaces and environments represented&lt;br /&gt;
in-game design.&lt;br /&gt;
The game-exercises of PLAYING WITH LOGIC 1 develop the following concepts and topics:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. LOGICAL FUNCTION&lt;br /&gt;
2. IDENTITY BY EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY&lt;br /&gt;
3. LOGICAL IDENTITY BY AFFINITY RELATION AND FUNCTION OF USE&lt;br /&gt;
4. LOGICAL CLASSIFICATION BY ONE AND TWO PROPERTIES&lt;br /&gt;
5. LOGICAL TABULATION AND CLASSIFICATION.&lt;br /&gt;
Each exercise shows an activity-game full of characters and events to which underlies a logic that attracts the curiosity of the child, to take him, year after year, idea after idea, the use of a series of reasoning needed to understand and interpret the world around him.&lt;br /&gt;
It is important that the teacher and/or parent presents the educational proposals, leaving the child time and the ability to understand and recreate the logical concept that acquires; This allows:&lt;br /&gt;
- The child to self evaluate and decide the time and manner of their own learning, becoming a participant and protagonist of his education;&lt;br /&gt;
- Teacher / parent to carefully follow the reasoning of the child without duties or evaluate, but having the freedom to relate in a calm and constructive." />
