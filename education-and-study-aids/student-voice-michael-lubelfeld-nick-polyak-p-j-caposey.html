  <title>Student Voice - Michael Lubelfeld, Nick Polyak, P. J. Caposey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Student Voice: From Invisible to Invaluable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is about why and how today&amp;rsquo;s leaders need to connect with students for success. The premise of this book is that student voice is often invisible and that is possibly why schools have changed little since the 19th Century. From digital citizenship to teacher evaluation, we submit that the voice of students can be and needs to be amplified. The authors wrote this book to help elevate the power and influence of student voice in the transformation and leadership of our schools. The authors provide context that helps frame where education has been, where it stands today, and where the authors propose we go in school leadership. To truly transform, schools leaders in the classroom, principal&amp;rsquo;s office, and district office need to elevate the voice of the student. There is no greater way to inspire our children than to let them have a say in their own education. We simply cannot create the leaders of tomorrow when we do not let them lead today. This book will provide examples of excellence, stories of success, and practical tips to help you move student voice from invisible to invaluable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
