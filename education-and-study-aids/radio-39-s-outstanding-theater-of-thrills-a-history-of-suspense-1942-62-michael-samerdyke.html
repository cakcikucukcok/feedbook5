  <title>Radio&#39;s Outstanding Theater of Thrills:  A History of &quot;Suspense&quot; 1942-62 - Michael Samerdyke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Did you ever have to read &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot; in school?  Did you ever wonder what radio drama was like?
From 1942 to 1962, &quot;Suspense&quot; was Radio&#39;s Outstanding Theater of Thrills.  Listeners hoping to give their nerves a workout could listen to stories from Cornell Woolrich, Ray Bradbury and Lucille Fletcher performed by actors such as Agnes Moorehead, Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, Richard Widmark and Vincent Price.  For two major decades in America&#39;s history, &quot;Suspense&quot; kept listeners glued to the set by playing on their anxieties ranging from tales of crime to science fiction to the Old West.
&quot;Suspense&quot; is a landmark in radio drama, one that foreshadowed TV programs such as &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone.&quot;
&quot;Radio&#39;s Outstanding Theater of Thrills&quot; guides the reader through the origin and development of his major radio series, that lasted from the darkest days of World War II to the Cuban Missile Crisis." />
