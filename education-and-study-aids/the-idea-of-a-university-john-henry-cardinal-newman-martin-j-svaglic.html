  <title>The Idea of a University - John Henry Cardinal Newman, Martin J. Svaglic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Idea of a University [is an] eloquent defense of a liberal education which is perhaps the most timeless of all [Newman&#39;s] books and certainly the one most intellectually accessible to readers of every religious faith and of none. . . . [O]nly one who has read The Idea of a University in its entirety, especially the nine discourses, can hope to understand why its reputation is so high: why the first reading of this book has been called an &#39;epoch&#39; in the life of a college man; why Walter Pater thought it &#39;the perfect handling of a theory&#39;; why the historian G. M. Young has ranked it with Aristotle&#39;s Ethics among the most valuable of all works on the aim of Education; or why Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch told his students at Cambridge that &#39;of all the books written in these hundred years there is perhaps none you can more profitably thumb and ponder.&#39;&quot; -from the introduction by Martin J. Svaglic" />
