  <title>A Guide for Treating Adolescent Sexual Abusers in Residential Settings - Jimmy D. McCamey Jr. Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Treating adolescent sexual abusers in the context of the community is not a new phenomenon, but research suggests as states revise their way of providing residential treatment services to adolescents with sexual abusive behaviors, there is a need to better understand how and when to treat this difficult population with a community treatment model that ensures best practice approaches that provides tested and proven treatment modalities for adolescent sexual abusers who are provided community-based residential treatment services.
This guide for treating adolescent sexual abusers addresses that question and explains the role of community-based residential treatment programs to ensure quality-tested and proven clinical interventions and the safety of others in the community. All the case studies that I have included in this guide for residential treatment with children and adolescents who sexually abuse have come from my twenty-year experience, research, and personal conversations with adolescent sexual abusers. In consideration of the privacy of those individuals, given names and identifying circumstances have been changed, thus such names used in the case studies does not represent an actual client I worked with during the past twenty years." />
