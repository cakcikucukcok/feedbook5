  <title>Fun &quot;In Store&quot; for Students - Chad B. Klapper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Times New Roman;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun In Store For Students &lt;/strong&gt;is a resource and activity book to help teachers and/or facilitators develop, operate, and/or justify a school store while achieving common core and other academic standards. There are many activities, resources, lessons, assessments, evaluations, and reproducible pages. This book is centered on a school store but it can be used for other school-based businesses. Section 1 contains assembly plans for a mobile school store. Section 2 lists the Wisconsin academic performance standards, and content standards that can be achieved by operating a school store, depending on your scope and goals. These examples may be used as a template for meeting standards in your state. Section 3 is a suggested sequence for developing and operating a school store. During the developing and operating process, ideas and examples are given to integrate some of the activities and processes into your classroom. Section 4 has you start thinking about forming business and education partnerships. Section 5 is the financial literacy section. This section is a useful tool because it opens students eyes to authentic hands-on learning that connects school work with career work/awareness, and the math associated with real-life living. Section 6 contains the appendices where you find most of your resources, supplemental material, lesson plans, activities, assessments, evaluations, and reproducible pages to be used by the students and facilitators of the school store. Section 7 contains additional resources to investigate. The developmental and operational processes for your school store may vary from school to school depending on your schools size, your goals, and your objectives for running a store. Some sample goals or objectives include: meeting academic standards, having a continuous fundraiser, developing employability, job-seeking, and consumer math skills, integrating school and work-based learning, expanding awareness of careers including entrepreneurship, and developing partnerships with businesses and the community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
