  <title>The Essentials of Science, Grades 7-12: Effective Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment (Priorities in Practice) - Rick Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Where is U.S. secondary-level science education heading today? That&#39;s the question that &lt;i&gt;The Essentials of Science, Grades 7-12&lt;/i&gt; sets out to answer. Over the last century, U.S. science classes have consistently relied on lectures, textbooks, rote memorization, and lab demonstrations. But with the onset of NCLB-mandated science testing and increased concern over the United States&#39; diminishing global stature in science and technology, public pressure is mounting to educate students for a deeper conceptual understanding of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through lively examples of classroom practice, interviews with award-winning science teachers and science education experts, and a wide-ranging look at research, readers will learn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;* How to make use of research within the cognitive sciences to foster critical thinking and deeper understanding.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* How to use backward design to bring greater coherence to the curriculum.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Innovative, engaging ideas for implementing scientific inquiry in the classroom.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Holistic strategies to address the complex problems of the achievement gap, equity, and resources in the science classroom.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Strategies for dealing with both day-to-day and NCLB assessments.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* How professional learning communities and mentoring can help teachers reexamine and improve their practice.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s secondary science teachers are faced with an often-overwhelming array of challenges. &lt;i&gt;The Essentials of Science, Grades 7-12&lt;/i&gt; can help educators negotiate these challenges while making their careers more productive and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This product listing is for the reflowable (ePub) version of the book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
