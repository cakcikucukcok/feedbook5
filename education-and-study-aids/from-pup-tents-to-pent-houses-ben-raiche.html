      <meta name="description" content="If you have read either of my past books you have been introduced to a positive thinking person, who loves life. I do not possess a desire to influence nor create any attitude not contributing to having a nice day for anyone. 
The persona and mentally developed attitudes of Ben Raiche have encompassed many and varied areas entertainment and occupations. I have been employed as a pickle maker, a hide piler, a dead animal truck driver, A soldier, A scientific engineer, A nuclear weapons test engineer, A balloon test pilot, a musician, A Governmental staff Executive and many more. 
My travels have been extensive, in that I have been everywhere I had any desire to visit. My intent related to publishing my innermost thoughts has allowed me to commiserate with persons I do not know. My love of people has included thoughts of extended respectful responsibility. I might say I love people. If you would like to be included, so be it!!! Friends do not take up valuable space in my life, and there is always room for one more. Have A Nice Day" />
