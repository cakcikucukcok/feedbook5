  <title>Speds  (Special Education Students) - Mirian Detres-Hickey, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is comprised of many of my teaching experiences with the SPEDs like me. The experiences I had as a Special Education teacher are from four different states and regions in the country. All having different ideas as to how a student with disabilities, should be taught and how they learn. Youd be surprised at the way some states treat and handle Speds. Nevertheless, I want to show you the love these children need at any age as well as the structure and discipline required for them to overcome this disability and succeed. I hope that Special Education teachers read this book for insight and training on what it really is to work with the Speds at any age. These are issues usually not taught in college classrooms. &lt;br /&gt;Many people may think I was harsh in some of my cases, but as I said, each student learns differently and all children need structure and discipline to learn what is necessary in making it and becoming an active successful member of society. With many of my Lessons Learned throughout the book I found the students always came through. At the end on their own or together they all shined like stars in the night. It was not about me but about them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
