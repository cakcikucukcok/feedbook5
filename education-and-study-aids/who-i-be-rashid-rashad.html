  <title>Who I Be! - Rashid Rashad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Description of the book: This book which focuses on the childs self-concept (also called self-perspective or self-identity) is a collection of beliefs about oneself that includes elements such as academic performance, gender roles and racial identity. Generally, self-concept embodies the answer to Who I Be? Humanist psychologist Carl Rogers believed that there were three different parts of the self-concept:                               
1.	Self-Image or how you see yourself.
2.	Self-Worth or how much you value yourself.
3.	Ideal-Self or how you wish you could be.
    Congruence or Incongruence of a positive self-concept has its earliest roots in childhood. Why is the self-concept so important? Because it literally regulates how well we put to use whatever knowledge that we already have. We perform as much to our self-concept as we do to our knowledge.
     This book is a tool to use for the child to increase a positive self-image, to bolster the childs self-worth, plus strongly place a high value of themselves and constantly striving to be their true ideal-self. Continual reading of this book will inculcate in the child to always be their better self!" />
