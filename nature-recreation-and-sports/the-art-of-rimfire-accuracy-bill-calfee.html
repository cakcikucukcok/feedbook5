  <title>The Art of Rimfire Accuracy - Bill Calfee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bill Calfee has been working with guns since the 1970s and decided to focus on the 22 rimfire beginning in the 1980s. Since the 1980s Bill has had many ideas on how to improve the accuracy of the 22 rimfire, some ideas have increased the accuracy potential tremendously and some ideas proved out to be learning experiences for future ideas.
Since about 2001 Bill has tried to capture his ideas, experiments, testing, and conclusions by writing about them. He has written about the successes that increased accuracy as well as the ideas that didnt improve accuracy. Although Bill is not a writer, he felt compelled to pass along the knowledge that he has obtained in the spirit of improving the accuracy of the 22 rimfire benchrest guns for everyone that has like goals. He has shared his writings previously with the benchrest community through different avenues.
In this book, all of Bills writings are assembled in a chronological order to show the evolution of the accuracy of the 22rf as he has experienced it. He goes into detail about each aspect of rimfire accuracy discussing all of the components and their contribution to the improved accuracy. This book is a must have for everyone that is serious about increasing the accuracy in their 22 rimfire guns." />
