  <title>Jim Morin&#39;s World - Jim Morin, Carl Hiaasen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Best cartoons from Jim Morin&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Want to laugh and enjoy some of the best cartoons from a gifted creator of editorial cartoons? And, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner (1996 and 2017)&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Miami Herald&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; Jim Morin has created some of the best editorial cartoons in the business:&lt;/b&gt; Political cartoonists distill opinions about power and culture into art and commentary with the sharp points of their pens. How does an artist who has produced over the past 40 years some of the best cartoons among editorial cartoonists in the business generate the ideas for a relentless stream of sharp political and social commentary? Most recently, during and after Election 2016, the remarkable artist&#39;s pen of Jim Morin has produced a steady stream of Donald Trump cartoons that have both delighted and infuriated followers, depending upon their side of the Donald Trump divide.  This book of best cartoons by Jim Morin is both funny and poignant. It is a nostalgic journey through the last 40 years of the comedy and reality of our world.
&lt;b&gt;Member of the exclusive club of Pulitzer Prize winners:&lt;/b&gt; Jim Morin has been the &lt;i&gt;Miami Herald&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; internationally syndicated editorial cartoonist since 1978. He is the Pulitzer Prize winner for editorial cartooning in 1996 and shared Pulitzer Prize winner status with the Miami Herald Editorial Board in 1983. In 2007, he won the prestigious Herblock Prize. He has covered eight U.S. presidents from Richard Nixon through Barack Obama, and now Donald Trump as candidate and Donald Trump as the new president. Morin also is syndicated nationally and internationally by his own Morintoons Syndicate at http://www.jimmorin.com. include &lt;i&gt;Line of Fire: Political Cartoons by Jim Morin&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bushed&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Ambushed&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;b&gt;Editorial cartoons from a gifted artist:&lt;/b&gt; Upon awarding the prestigious Herblock Prize to Jim Morin in 2007, Harry Katz, the Herb Block Foundation curator, praised this two-time Pulitzer Prize winner for his &quot;impressive, unrelenting barrage of cartoons and caricatures displaying artistry, courage and conviction.&quot; Morin should also be praised for his wit and timely wry sense of humor, which has been a staple of the Miami Herald since 1978. &lt;i&gt;Jim Morin&#39;s World:  40 Years of Social Commentary From A Two-Time Pulitzer Prize-Winning Cartoonist&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of some of the best cartoons by this gifted artist and commentator on our times.
&lt;b&gt;What do some of Jim Morin&#39;s peers say about him?&lt;/b&gt;
 &quot;We’re lucky to have one of the very best, waiting with pen in hand to carve up the phonies, blowhards, crooks and hypocrites who make headlines. They might not want to end up in a Jim Morin cartoon, but they will.&quot;   -  Carl Hiaasen
&quot;Jim Morin has all the attributes of a first-rate cartoonist. He has a clear idea how he feels about issues and he wants you to know about it. He then expresses himself clearly and concisely in a manner that is both exciting and explorative.&quot;  -  Pat Oliphant
&quot;Jim Morin is one of the great under-appreciated cartoonists of the last quarter century.&quot;    - The Comics Reporter" />
