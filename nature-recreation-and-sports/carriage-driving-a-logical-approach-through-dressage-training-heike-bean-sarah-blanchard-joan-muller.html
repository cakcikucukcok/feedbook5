  <title>Carriage Driving: A Logical Approach Through Dressage Training - Heike Bean, Sarah Blanchard, Joan Muller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A book that will take the most novice beginner and permit him or her to progress to any level of driving with a clear understanding of how and why things are done.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;b&gt;William E. Miller&lt;/b&gt;, M.D., President, American Driving Society&lt;p&gt;&quot;[The authors] obviously know their subject well and treat it with much sensitivity and wisdom. I only wish I had this book before I started my driving program.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;b&gt;Sasha Rockefeller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The modern bible of carriage driving . . . now back by popular demand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widely renowned as the definitive book on training the driving horse, &lt;i&gt;Carriage Driving&lt;/i&gt; offers an easy-to-follow, practical guide to this increasingly popular sport.&lt;p&gt;The philosophy is simple but remarkably effective: If driving is as much fun for your horse as it is for you, he will be a willing partner in the endeavor. With that in mind, &lt;i&gt;Carriage Driving&lt;/i&gt; focuses on building a strong physical, mental, and emotional relationship with your horse. Equine mechanics, selecting the right bit and tack, harnessing, and ground training are just a few of the topics addressed.&lt;p&gt;Drivers at any level will benefit greatly from this groundbreaking book, which has stood for more than a decade as the preeminent resource on training a balanced, responsive, and safe driving horse." />
