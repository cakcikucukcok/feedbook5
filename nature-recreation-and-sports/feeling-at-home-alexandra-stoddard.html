  <title>Feeling at Home - Alexandra Stoddard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most decorating books omit the most important element of the home: you. Does your home reflect who you really are? &lt;em&gt;Feeling at Home&lt;/em&gt; focuses on this most essential aspect of decorating: creating a home that is truly your emotional center. Every room and object should answer your needs and make you feel more human and whole. Alexandra Stoddard gently leads us through a process of self-attunement and self-expression in which we discover not only our practical needs, but also our yearnings--perhaps a sunny spot for reading; a colorful nook for ironing; an inviting place for paperwork. She urges us to question the rules and to never &amp;#34;pre-compromise&amp;#34; by talking ourselves out of our true desires. With imaginative and practical examples from her personal and professional life, she helps us discover countless ways to express ourselves at home and instantly feel comfort, pleasure, and ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why settle for merely being &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; our homes when we can be &amp;#34;at home?&amp;#34; &lt;em&gt;Feeling at Home&lt;/em&gt; puts us on the path to home as we&amp;#39;ve always dreamed it could be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
