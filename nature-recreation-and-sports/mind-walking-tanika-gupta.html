      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Moving, powerful, ethereal; Mind Walking is a celebration of the life of one extraordinary man, the enduring love story of a mature couple and their family. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bobby has led a remarkable life. Migrating from India as a young man he found love in the UK with his with wife Moira, but as a Parsi Bobby was expected to marry within the community. His family disowns him and as a result he cuts them, their religion and their culture from his life forever... until his mind starts to wander. As secrets and hidden stories tumble out of Bobby&#39;s mouth, his family start to question the truth about their ancestry and shared history. Mind Walking explores what happens to a family when the mind of an old, Indian man, Bobby starts to unravel. This delicate, poetic play tumbles and traverses through Bobby&#39;s memories on an intergenerational journey of family ties, religious dogma and cultural expectations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
