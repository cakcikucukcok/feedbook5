  <title>Alabama Stitch Book - Natalie Chanin, Stacie Stukin, Robert Rausch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Haute homespun out of the Deep South.+? That&#39;s how &lt;I&gt;Vogue&lt;/I&gt; magazine has described the fashion of Natalie Chanin. &lt;I&gt;Alabama Stitch Book&lt;/I&gt; brings us a collection of projects and stories from her clothing and lifestyle company, Alabama Chanin, known for the cutting-edge twist it puts on tried-and-true sewing, quilting, and embroidery techniques, applied mostly by hand to recycled cotton jersey. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This long-awaited book from Chanin begins with her story. After living in New York and Vienna for over 20 years, she began to transform cotton T-shirts into high fashion using the needlework skills she learned as a child in Florence, Alabama. When she moved home, Chanin hired local women (many of whom had worked in the state&#39;s now defunct textile factories) to stitch her couture collections with her. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What follows is a step-by-step guide to the stitching, stenciling, and beading techniques used in the 20 projects showcased in the book: T-shirts, skirts, and corsets that are sold at chic shops around the world, plus a journal cover, sampler quilt, and tablecloth, among others. Also included are a pullout stencil, perforated postcard for bead-embroidery, and reusable patterns. Throughout are Robert Rausch&#39;s beautiful photographs set against the back roads, farms, and homesteads of the rural South.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
