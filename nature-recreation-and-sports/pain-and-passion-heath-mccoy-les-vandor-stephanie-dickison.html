  <title>Pain and Passion - Heath McCoy, Les Vandor, Stephanie Dickison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Calgary&#39;s Stampede Wrestling spawned some of the biggest wrestling stars in history, from mat kings of the past like Gene Kiniski and Superstar Billy Graham to modern idols like Bret &quot;Hitman&quot; Hart, the British Bulldogs, and Chris Benoit. Pain and Passion tells how a small, family-run wrestling business profoundly influenced the world of professional wrestling as we know it today. 
Pain and Passion takes readers on a rowdy ride through the evolution of Stu Hart&#39;s Calgary promotion, from its meagre beginnings in the 1940s, its peak in the 1980s, and its fall as Vince McMahon&#39;s World Wrestling Entertainment changed the face of wrestling forever. 
But this is more than a wrestling story - it&#39;s a tale of family and of human tragedy. The Hart family lived for the wrestling business and, like Starbucks mowing down a mom-and-pop coffee shop, the emergence of McMahon&#39;s media colossus ran Stampede into the ground. The wrestling game lost its innocence and western Canada lost a staple of its pop culture. As for the Hart family, the once-mighty clan was nearly destroyed by the business it loved. 
The Stampede Wrestling story is a wild blood-on-the-mat saga over fifty years in the making. It&#39;s sure to captivate not only wrestling fans, but anyone who appreciates a powerful drama." />
