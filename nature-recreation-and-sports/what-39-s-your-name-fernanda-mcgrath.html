Author Nan McGrath believes that keeping the name simple will make it easier on the owner when addressing their pet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We sometimes find ourselves wondering how and why people give their pets the names that they do. There are really no rules or guidelines; its really a gut feeling, and you know when you have picked the right name.

Getting a pet is a happy time in our lives, and choosing the name can be just as much fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arranged in alphabetical order, &lt;i&gt;Whats Your Name&lt;/i&gt; offers hundreds of names for a variety of petsfrom Elmo to Jackson to Moose, the options are interesting and varied. You can find just the right name for your new pet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
