  <title>The Sound of Silence - Austin Okorie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The sound of silence is a book about nature, love and relationships.Nature  has a profound touch or intimacy with man.This &quot;touch&quot; is most significant in all our interactions with it (nature itself).Incidentally, many do not have the time or the consciousness to tap into this refreshing and recreating power,that is manifest all around us.No wonder the Almighty in his initial plan,placed man in a garden! In this book such poems as Dilemma of a seer,Sunrise at dawn,The sound of silence and Friends of yesteryears among others are reflections on the power, light and language of nature.  The power and influence of love on the human soul seems to have a subtle similarity with that exerted by nature.The only difference being in the mode and dimensions of operation.While the touch of nature is gentle and persuasive, the power of love is passionate and compelling.Most of us are aware of the ecstatic feelings of an evening-out, spent with a loved one in the presence of a retiring sunset.The silhouette of a beautiful mountain, set on fire by such an evening sun.Even the unpoetic begin to manifest poetic tendencies under such scenario.Such titles as A pathetic sunset,A hopeful mid-day,I saw a tombstone,The day we parted,My best friend, among others,are reflections on love and nature.Some common experiences we encounter in relationships are also represented in some titles in this book,as much as possible my posture had been honest and non judgemental especially with those true- life and personal experiences.The good,the bad, and the not-so bad as well as the pure fictional compositions.Some of this titles include among others,the following;To the one that used to love me,Will you marry me,Good journey,Book keeping,Responsibility,Constantly,Letters of gold,Ever learning,and Nothing more to lose.It is left to the discerning reader to discriminate between the figurative use of language in this book towards achieving hopefully, a worthwhile appreciation of this work,while trully believing that &quot;when the chronicles are done, your name will be there with mine, written side by side in letters of gold&quot;!" />
