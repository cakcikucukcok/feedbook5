  <title>The Kitty - Shawn P. Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shawn Flynn and his fianc&amp;eacute;e are excited to start their new life together. They are planning a wedding and have bought a new home. The last thing the two of them need right now is a new cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their recently purchased house seems to come complete with a stray orange feline&amp;mdash;a cat with a vibrant personality and a talent for mousing. So Shawn soon finds himself with a regular companion. Little does he realize that this cat will shortly become more important to him than he can possibly imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Shawn&amp;rsquo;s personal life begins to shift in ways he never saw coming, Kitty remains a constant source of stability and comfort. Shawn gave Kitty a home, and now Kitty gives Shawn the love he needs to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A touching and inspiring story of heartfelt companionship, &lt;em&gt;The Kitty&lt;/em&gt; offers an uplifting perspective on what it means to find true friendship in this world. Anyone who has ever shared a meaningful connection with a pet will fall head over heels in love with Kitty and Shawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Shawn discovers, sometimes we don&amp;rsquo;t even realize we need to be rescued&amp;mdash;until we are.&lt;/p&gt;" />
