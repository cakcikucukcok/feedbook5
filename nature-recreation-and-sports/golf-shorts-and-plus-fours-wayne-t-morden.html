  <title>Golf Shorts and Plus Fours - Wayne T. Morden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;Anger is a part of being human ... how one deals with it defines him, as you so aptly describe. The one constant is the ability to let anger go once its grabbed on to you. Some are better at it than others. Thanks for your thoughts on this ... they were on point.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Watson, eight-time major championship winner on reading Hole No. 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;It was delightful reading, and your depiction of the Pebble Beach experience was classic (and very much appreciated, I might add ...). The comparison to St Andrews is a terrific debate. Thanks for making it so appealing. Our sincere best wishes to you in bringing this to many readers and golfers throughout the world.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RJ Harper, Senior VP, Golf at Pebble Beach Company on reading Hole No. 11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;This is the best side-by-side presentation and analysis Ive seen.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Peper, editor, LINKS Magazine on reading Hole No. 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Wayne really captured the Augusta National you see in person. It was an enjoyable chapter to read and evoked strong memories of playing the Masters. Well done.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Player, nine-time major championship winner on reading Hole No. 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The Verma Cuppers certainly seemed to enjoy themselves and you did well to run on the West Sands, albeit in slow motion, after your experiences the day before! We are delighted you enjoyed the experience at St Andrews and can certainly detect from your writing your appreciation of the history surrounding the Home of Golf.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Grant, Director of Golf, St. Andrews Links Trust on reading Hole No. 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Golf Shorts and Plus Fours: Musings from a Golfing Traditionalist&lt;/i&gt; from Wayne T. Morden is a sometimes comic look at the game of golf in all its glory and idiosyncrasies. Arranged like an eighteen-hole golf courseincluding trivia refreshments and three additional playoff holesthis collection of short stories offers life lessons and relies heavily on golfs fundamental tenets to remind golfers why they are so obsessed with this pastime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morden conveys exasperation over the proverbial sand trap and laughs over Star Wars lingo and Verma Cup antics. Golf has not only taught him how to be a sportsman but it has also taught him how to be a better man to his friends, family, and fellow golfers. &lt;i&gt;Golf Shorts and Plus Fours&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of well-informed, analytical and entertaining bits of wisdom that will warm the heart of any devoted golfer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
