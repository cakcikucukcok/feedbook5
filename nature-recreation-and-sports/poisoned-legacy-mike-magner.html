  <title>Poisoned Legacy - Mike Magner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The story is all too-familiar: On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, killing eleven workers and creating the largest oil spill in the history of U.S. offshore drilling. But, this wasn&#39;t the first time British Petroleum and its cost-cutting practices destroyed parts of the natural world.  It also was not the first time that BP&#39;s negligence resulted in the loss of human life, ruined family businesses or shattered dreams.  Journalist Mike Magner has been tracking BP&#39;s reckless path for years and, for the first time, focuses on the human price of BP&#39;s rise to power. From Alaska to Kansas to the Gulf, Magner has talked to people whose lives have been destroyed by BP&#39;s almost unparalleled corporate greed.  When BP acquired an abandoned Kansas refinery in 1998, it discovered one of the most contaminated groundwater plumes in the U.S. Rather than begin a full cleanup, BP declared there was no cause for concern. A former schoolteacher alarmed by cancer cases in the town pushed her community to take BP to court. In 2005, an explosion at BP&#39;s Texas City refinery, operating with a raft of safety problems because of neglected maintenance, killed fifteen people including the mother and father of a young woman who was driving there to spend the Easter holidays with her parents.  A year later, thousands of gallons of oil spilled onto Alaska&#39;s North Slope from a corroded BP pipeline. Following a hurricane, BP&#39;s Thunder Horse rig almost sank because of a flaw in its construction, and repair work exposed even more serious problems.  Poisoned Legacy is the searing true story of the rise and fall of BP, a company that went from being a green maverick promising a world &quot;Beyond Petroleum&quot; to one of the most notorious corporate villains in history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
