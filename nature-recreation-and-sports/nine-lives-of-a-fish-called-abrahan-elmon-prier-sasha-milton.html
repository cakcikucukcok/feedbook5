  <title>Nine Lives of a Fish Called Abrahan - Elmon Prier, Sasha Milton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of the book entitled Nine Lives of a Fish Called Abraham follows the odyssey of a goldfish won as a prize at a Hamilton, Ohio, carnival. Ms. Darlene accompanied a group of children to this heat-filled outing. All the children won goldfish encased in plastic bags containing water. All their goldfish died from heat, except one, before they arrived back in Middletown. A little boy named Darius had the sole surviving goldfish. When he got home, he named his little fish Abraham. 
As Abraham began to grow in his nonfiltered fish bowl in the living room, he began to display skills that were not present in ordinary goldfish. Abraham, for some reason, manages to avoid obstacles, pitfalls, and a family dog to live a life longer than a goldfish is supposed to live. 
Dr. James Ewers, college administrator, said, Elmons A Fish Called Abraham provides young children with some invaluable lessons about determination and never giving up. Parents will be well served to get this book for their children. 
Cheryl Owens, assistant principal, said, This is a remarkable story of Abraham, a fish, and his will to survive. The multitalented fifteen-year-old Sasha Milton, illustrator, is awesome. 
Kendall Wright, motivational speaker and minister, had these words: Elmon Prier has cradled a conversational story with concrete lessons firmly planted on every page. 
The book Nine Lives of a Fish Called Abraham hopes to encourage young readers to bounce back or get back up when they encounter lifes obstacles, pitfalls, and stumbling blocks." />
