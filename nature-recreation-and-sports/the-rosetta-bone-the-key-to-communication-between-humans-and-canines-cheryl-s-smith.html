  <title>The Rosetta Bone: The Key to Communication Between Humans and Canines - Cheryl S. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Far too often, we humans expect our dogs to understand what we say to them. Though we may spend a lot of time talking to them, we&#39;re really not communicating. And without proper communication, it&#39;s impossible to train a dog properly-- let alone make your human/canine relationship a rewarding one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Packed with unique insights and gentle training advice, The Rosetta Bone provides average dog owners with the know-how they need to decipher canine meanings, communicate effectively, increase training success, and share a deeper bond. Focusing on the behavioral basis-- the &quot;silent&quot; symbols-- for learning, understanding, and communicating, expert dog trainer and competitor Cheryl S. Smith reveals how you can use your own body language to send a message and even teach a dog what specific words mean. She reveals how a dog&#39;s breed can affect his personality and explains how to decode-- and correct-- common behavior problems. With the knowledge and solutions this book provides, you will train more effectively, enjoy your dog more, and ease your own stress. What&#39;s more, you&#39;ll apply what you&#39;ve learned immediately, with solid, practical advice on:&lt;br&gt;* Learning the As, Bs, Cs, and Ds of human-canine communication&lt;br&gt;* Teaching English to your dog-- and, in turn, understanding &quot;Doglish&quot;&lt;br&gt;* Using body language to assist in communication and help your dog learn&lt;br&gt;* Incorporating various kinds of touch to tighten your bond &lt;br&gt;* Making rewards and reprimands real, relevant, and reliable&lt;br&gt;* Understanding the relationship between kids and dogs &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Supplemented with enlightening, easy-to-do exercises with your dog, as well as quotes from trainers, behaviorists, veterinarians, and humane society workers, The Rosetta Bone is a revealing guide to making life better in your human/canine household." />
