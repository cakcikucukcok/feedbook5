  <title>The Time-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Ed. - Chris Carmichael, Jim Rutberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Time-Crunched Cyclist&lt;/i&gt; reveals the fastest way to get fit for road racing, century rides, gravel grinders, cyclocross, Gran Fondos, and mountain bike events. &lt;/b&gt;With elite cycling coach Chris Carmichael&#39;s innovative, time-saving approach, busy cyclists will develop fitness, speed, and power in just 6 hours a week. Now powered by Strava, this updated third edition of &lt;i&gt;The Time-Crunched Cyclist&lt;/i&gt; training program taps into the most popular cycling social network to help cyclists get fired up to crush their workouts, one segment at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through his popular endurance coaching service, Carmichael noticed that many busy cyclists are unable to make performance gains using conventional training methods; they simply don&#39;t have enough time to train. So CTS developed a new approach-the Time-Crunched Training Program-to help cyclists achieve competitive fitness and power without the impossible time demands of traditional training methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Time-Crunched Cyclist&lt;/i&gt; shows cyclists how to build fitness on a realistic schedule by tapping the power of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts. Cyclists learn the science behind this alternative approach to training before performing the CTS field tests to get a baseline reading of their fitness. Nine comprehensive training plans include effective time-crunched workouts, nutrition guidelines, and strength training to develop the speed and endurance for a wide variety of cycling races and events. The new Time-Crunched Training Plans cover: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· New and Experienced plans for criteriums, road races, and cyclocross&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· New, Experienced, and Competitive plans for century rides and Gran Fondos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Gravel racing and ultraendurance mountain biking plans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Intermediate and Advanced plans for commuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This new, third edition integrates Strava, the popular ride tracking and analysis program.&lt;/b&gt; Powered by Strava, the Time-Crunched program becomes interactive, social, highly motivating-and focuses riders on the training data that matters most. It also adds the Time-Crunched Diet, a sports nutrition approach designed to help riders optimize their power-to-weight ratio with new guidelines on eating behaviors and delicious recipes from chefs Michael Chiarello and Matt Accarrino. A new chapter on hydration and managing heat stress will show athletes simple ways to avoid overheating that lead to better performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Time-Crunched Cyclist&lt;/i&gt; can help you capture your best performance-all in the time you have right now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
