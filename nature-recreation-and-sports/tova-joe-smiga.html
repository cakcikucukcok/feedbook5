  <title>Tova - Joe Smiga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tova is the name for a girl in Hebrew, which means good. The book is written in memory of my German shorthaired pointer. I wish to honor her breed. She was loving, obedient, most of the time, exceptionally friendly, a great bird dog and a wonderful companion. The book illustrates nine and a half years of exceptional devotion to the dog and unconditional love returned to the owners. Tragically, her life was cut short by the existence of a disease that most veterinarians dont recognize because they are not taught about it. Nor are they exposed to it, at least not here in New England. This book is vital to all pet owners and a wake up call to veterinarians. This book is also uniquely original, since, Tova and Joe both have dialogue in it." />
