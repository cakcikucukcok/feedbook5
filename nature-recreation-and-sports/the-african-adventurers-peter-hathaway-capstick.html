  <title>The African Adventurers - Peter Hathaway Capstick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hailed as the adventure-writing successor to Hemingway and Ruark, only Peter Hathaway Capstick &quot;can write action as cleanly and suspensefully as the best of his predecessors&#39; (&lt;i&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/i&gt;). This long-awaited sequel to &lt;i&gt;Death in the Silent Places&lt;/i&gt; brings to life four turn-of-the-century adventurers and the savage frontiers they braved.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Frederick Selous, a British hunter, naturalist, and soldier, rewrote the history books with his fearless treks deep into Africa.&lt;br&gt;* English game ranger Constantine &quot;Iodine&quot; Ionides saved Tanganyikan villages from man-eating lions and leopards. He also gained lasting fame for his uncanny ability to capture black mambas, cobras, Gaboon vipers, and other deadly snakes.&lt;br&gt;* The dashing Brit Johnny Boyes who gained the chieftainship of the Kikuyu tribe with sheer bravado and survived the ferocious battles and ambushes of intertribal warfare.&lt;br&gt;* And Scottish ex-boxer, Jim Sutherland, one of the best ivory hunters who ever lived. His tracking skills and stamina afoot became the stuff of African hunting legend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The African Adventurers: A Return to the Silent Places&lt;/i&gt;, Capstick delivers &quot;the kind of chilling stories that Hemingway only heard second-hand...with a flair and style that Papa himself would admire&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Guns and Ammo&lt;/i&gt;). The author&#39;s pungent wit and his authenticity gained from years in the bush make this quartet of vintage heroics an unforgettable return to the silent places.&lt;/p&gt;" />
