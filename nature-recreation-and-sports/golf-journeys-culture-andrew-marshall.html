  <title>Golf Journeys &amp; Culture - Andrew Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Golf Journeys &amp; Culture is a collection of golf trips to some of the most beautiful and interesting golf courses in the world. During an 8-year period, Andrew and Paul Marshall travelled to 13 countries and played 65 golf courses &amp;ndash; from the wild, sheep-tended links of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, the tropical palm-fringed fairways of Jamaica to the lowest golf course on earth in Death Valley, California.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Golf Journeys &amp; Culture is about two brothers&amp;#39; connection and a shared passion to combine golf with travelling and experiencing different cultures. It is a book that goes beyond playing golf in fabulous locations, it is also about the experiences the two brothers shared, the people they met and the situations they found themselves in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From cheese-tasting in Normandy, relaxing in the surreal waters of Iceland&amp;#39;s Blue Lagoon to observing how cigars are hand-crafted in the Dominican Republic - the off-course activities and cultural aspects of the countries they visited played an integral role in the creation of Golf Journeys &amp; Culture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Golf Journeys &amp; Culture will appeal in equal measure to both the armchair and travelling golfer. Each of the 13 chapters is illustrated with Paul&amp;#39;s superb images, and has a fact file that provides an informative guide to planning your own golf journeys to the featured countries." />
