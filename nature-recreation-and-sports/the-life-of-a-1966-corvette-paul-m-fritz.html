  <title>The Life of a 1966 Corvette - Paul M. Fritz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paul M. Fritz’s love affair with Corvettes began in 1963, when the local owner of a 1963 Saddle Tan fuel-injected coupe would park his Corvette next to the bank in Schuylkill Haven, Pennsylvania, on Friday nights for all. A few years later, though, he bought a 1966 Sunfire Yellow, 427 cubic inch, 425 horsepower Corvette Coupe, which he’s owned for forty-seven years. For much of that time, however, the car was in storage, as he enlisted in the Navy in October 1969 and spent a lot of time overseas. It came out of storage in November 1998, and a full-body, off-the-frame restoration began at The Vette Shop in Warminster, Pennsylvania. The restoration followed the process of the National Corvette Restorers Society, and the Corvette went on to win the society’s Top Flight Award, The Zora Arkus-Duntov Mark of Excellence Award. Relive your youth, renew your commitment to living in the moment, and celebrate the special bond between a man and his beloved car with The Life of a 1966 Corvette." />
