  <title>Bubishi: The Classic Manual of Combat - Patrick MaCarthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Treasured for centuries by karate&#39;s top masters, the &lt;I&gt;Bubishi&lt;/I&gt; is a classic Chinese work on philosophy, strategy, medicine, and technique as they relate to the martial arts.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Referred to as the &quot;bible of karate&quot; by famous master Chojun Miyagi, for hundreds of years the &lt;I&gt;Bubishi&lt;/I&gt;was a secret text passed from master to student in China and later in Okinawa. All of karate&#39;s legendary masters have studied it, applied its teachings, or copied passages from it. No other classic work has had as dramatic an impact on the shaping and development of karate as the &lt;I&gt;Bubishi&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Karate historian and authority Patrick McCarthy spent over ten years researching and studying the &lt;I&gt;Bubishi&lt;/I&gt; and the arts associated with it. The first English translation of this remarkable martial arts manual includes numerous explanations and notes. McCarthy&#39;s work also includes groundbreaking research on Okinawan and Chinese history, as well as the fighting and healing traditions that developed in those countries, making it a gold mine for researchers and practitioners alike. For the final word on the true origins and spirit of classic Okinawan martial arts, one need look no further. This karate book is one of the best karate training supplements available.&lt;/div&gt;" />
