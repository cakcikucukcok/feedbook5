  <title>Reticent and Tranquil - Randal Weston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reticent and Tranquil&lt;/i&gt; presents an inspiring poetry collection that embraces a spiritual passion for everyday life. Author Randal Weston conjures the emotions that lifes journey brings at every turn. Inner strength is evident in his poems, along with his love for others and an appreciative attitude for those around him. Throughout our years on earth, we trek many roads. Good and bad situations are guaranteed, but the way we handle them reveals our faith and core.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From the patriotic beauty of Old Glory to an intriguing poem about The Wooden Chief, Westons unique voice resonates in each of his poem as they bring his innermost thoughts to life. With tones ranging from realistic to fun to dreamy and visionary, the verses of &lt;i&gt;Reticent and Tranquil&lt;/i&gt; present his peaceful energy for all to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night Stared&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All was silent and all was still,&lt;br /&gt;as night stared at the two men.&lt;br /&gt;One wore a muddy gray uniform;&lt;br /&gt;the other, a muddy blue uniform.&lt;br /&gt;Both lives had ended due to&lt;br /&gt;circumstantial fate. Neither&lt;br /&gt;soldier would return home, marry&lt;br /&gt;or have children. Had the men&lt;br /&gt;met in another time, another&lt;br /&gt;place, perhaps they would have&lt;br /&gt;been friends. But now, all was&lt;br /&gt;silent and all was still, as&lt;br /&gt;night stared at the two men.&lt;/p&gt;" />
