  <title>The Official Book of the Neapolitan Mastiff - Sherilyn Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In more than 35 years of intense experience with dogs, and more than 20 years of that as a veterinarian, I have never met another domesticated dog that behaves like a Neapolitan Mastiff,&amp;rdquo; writes Dr. Sherilyn Allen, as she begins her detailed analysis of this most unique breed of dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long out of print,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Official Book of the Neapolitan Mastiff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is considered the most expansive and authoritative English-language book about this magnificent Italian breed, discussing its history, conformation, temperament, rearing and more &amp;mdash; all illustrated with more than 400 photographs of great Neos from around the world. This reissued and revised volume contains all that original material, plus a special foreword by the author and a new chapter discussing the evolution of the breed in the two decades since this book was first published. A must for any owner, breeder or admirer of this ancient, awe-inspiring breed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Official Book of the Neapolitan Mastiff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You want to understand the Mastino Napoletano? The story behind this ancient breed? Its charisma and myth as much as its conformation, health and keeping? Then Sherilyn Allen&amp;rsquo;s exquisite book is an absolute must-read for any&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Mastinaro&lt;/em&gt;, as nothing more educational has ever been written about the Neapolitan Mastiff. It will open the doors for readers to all that&amp;nbsp;has been previously published in the Mastino&amp;rsquo;s native land.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;mdash; Christofer Habig, FCI judge, author and Mastino breed specialist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am very pleased that Dr. Sherilyn Allen&amp;rsquo;s important book is being republished, and I hope it will be read by many new Mastinari. It gave me the opportunity to remember just how much Sherilyn has done for the Mastino, and not just in the United States.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;mdash; Giuseppe Alessandra, FCI judge, author, ATIMANA president and Mastino breed specialist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;As the author so perfectly describes, the Neapolitan Mastiff is not only a work of art but a breed still living its ancient history. It is incumbent upon those of us who love our Neos to understand them and to protect their heritage and their future. Dr. Allen&amp;rsquo;s words should be heeded by every owner. As she once said to me, &amp;lsquo;More Sparta and less Athens.&amp;rsquo; It works!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;mdash; Neo fancier Susie Schramm, West Virginia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
