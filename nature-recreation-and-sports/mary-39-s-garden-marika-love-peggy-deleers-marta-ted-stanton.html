  <title>Mary&#39;s Garden - Marika Love, Peggy deLeers, Marta, Ted Stanton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Mary&#39;s Garden&lt;/b&gt; is the story of a little girl who wants a garden in her
yard.  Her garden grows so well it gives more food than her family and
friends can eat.  She is aware that there are poor people in her county
who don&#39;t have transportation.  Sometimes, they have to take two or
three buses to get to a grocery store.
&lt;P&gt;
Mary&#39;s garden expands to become an organic produce stand, and then
expands again into a building with a vegetarian kitchen and dining room.
People come from miles around to eat the delicious food that is served
there, grown on the land nearby.
&lt;P&gt;
The author is a member of the Bioneers, which stands for &quot;biological
pioneers&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Bioneers.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.Bioneers.org&lt;/a&gt;). Marika is learning about many projects to
naturally restore human health and the planet.  At the 2004 Bioneers
Conference, LaDonna Redmond spoke about the issue of bringing organic
foods and urban farms to poor local communities which have otherwise 
been left out of the picture.
&lt;P&gt;
LaDonna&#39;s son had terrible allergies, and she decided to improve her
family&#39;s nutrition to help him get better.  She made the shocking
statement that, in her inner Chicago neighborhood, &quot;It&#39;s easier to buy a
38 caliber pistol than to find an organic apple!&quot;  She and her husband
started an inner city organic produce store as a result of this
revelation.
Marika decided to create an organic gardening project to blanket her county, the nation, and the world with organic, local sources of healthful food.  She also formed a nonprofit organization,  JOY OF LEARNING CENTERS (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joyoflearningcenters.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.joyoflearningcenters.org&lt;/a&gt;) to teach about the relationship of good food to human health.  The Project is called The Prosperity Project, and is described on the website.  All profits from sales of &quot;Mary&#39;s Garden&quot; will be used to support The Prosperity Project.  
By buying this book, you will be investing in good health for yourself, your family and your fellow human beings world wide!  
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Mary&#39;s Garden&lt;/b&gt; is designed to appeal to &quot;children of all ages&quot;, from
the very young to the young adults and parents who might be moved to
create a similar project.  It&#39;s also an inspiration for people to create
similar programs in their own area, with a flyer and photos showing how
to get started.  There&#39;s a coloring book called &quot;Wiggle E. Worm&quot; that
all children seem to love." />
