  <title>Berlin Games - Guy Walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;IN 1936, Adolf Hitler welcomed the world to Berlin to attend the Olympic Games. It promised to be not only a magnificent sporting event but also a grand showcase for the rebuilt Germany. No effort was spared to present the Third Reich as the newest global power. But beneath the glittering surface, the Games of the Eleventh Olympiad of the Modern Era came to act as a crucible for the dark political forces that were gathering, foreshadowing the bloody conflict to come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1936 Olympics were nothing less than the most political sporting event of the last century&amp;#8212;an epic clash between proponents of barbarism and those of civilization, both of whom tried to use the Games to promote their own values. &lt;em&gt;Berlin Games&lt;/em&gt; is the complete history of those fateful two weeks in August. It is a story of the athletes and their accomplishments, an eye-opening account of the Nazi machine&#39;s brazen attempt to use the Games as a model of Aryan superiority and fascist efficiency, and a devastating indictment of the manipulative power games of politicians, diplomats, and Olympic officials that would ultimately have profound consequences for the entire world. &lt;/p&gt;" />
