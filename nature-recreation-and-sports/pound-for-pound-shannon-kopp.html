  <title>Pound for Pound - Shannon Kopp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The brave, inspiring story of one woman&amp;#39;s recovery from a debilitating eating disorder, and the remarkable shelter dogs who unexpectedly loved her back to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;The dogs don&amp;#8217;t judge me or give me a motivational speech. They don&amp;#8217;t rush me to heal or grow. They sit in my lap and lick my face and make me feel chosen. And sometimes, it hits me hard that I&amp;#39;m doing the exact thing I say I cannot do. Changing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pound for Pound&lt;/em&gt; is an inspirational tale about one woman&amp;#8217;s journey back to herself, and a heartfelt homage to the four-legged heroes who unexpectedly saved her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For seven years, Shannon Kopp battled the silent, horrific, and all-too-common disease of bulimia. Then, at twenty-four, she got a job working at the San Diego Humane Society and SPCA, where in caring for shelter dogs, she found the inspiration to heal and the courage to forgive herself. With the help of some extraordinary homeless animals, Shannon realized that her suffering was the birthplace of something beautiful. Compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannon&amp;#8217;s poignant memoir is a story of hope, resilience, and the spiritual healing animals bring to our lives. &lt;em&gt;Pound for Pound&lt;/em&gt; vividly reminds us that animals are more than just friends and companions&amp;#8212;they can teach us how to savor the present moment and reclaim our joy. Rich with emotion and inspiration it is essential reading for animal lovers and everyone who has struggled to change.&lt;/p&gt;" />
