By reducing classic Arts &amp;amp; Crafts furniture designs to their basics, then adding simple, screw-together joinery, anyone can build great-looking furniture. Using basic tools (jigsaw, miter saw or circular saw and a cordless drill) even as a first-time woodworker you can successfully create a piece of furniture in a weekend that you&#39;ll proudly display for years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each of the traditional (and some original) have designs in &lt;i&gt;Arts &amp;amp; Crafts Furniture Anyone Can Make&lt;/i&gt; have been adjusted for size to accommodate the standard poplar, red oak or pine boards readily available at your local home center. The boards are sold cut to thickness and width, so with most of the projects all you need to do is cut the pieces to length and put them together. Even the finishes used are &quot;off-she-shelf,&quot; relying on stains, paints and finish coats that are sold in any home center, and are easy to apply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pick up some supplies today and build one of these classic projects!&lt;/p&gt;" />
