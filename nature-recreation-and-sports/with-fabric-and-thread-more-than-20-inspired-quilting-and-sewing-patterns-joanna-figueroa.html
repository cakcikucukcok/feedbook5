Long-time quilters, committed to their craft for decades, are starting to experiment with a bit of home sewing or simple sewing for their grandchildren. The younger side of the sewing community is embracing the world of patchwork and quilting, a world that once seemed inaccessible or even undesirable to younger seamstresses.

Plus, a special section features six patterns that can be accomplished two different ways: one using sewing techniques and one using quilting techniques. The result is two unique looks from a single pattern.&lt;P&gt;• Provides an excellent stepping-off point for sewers learning to quilt, and quilters learning to sew&lt;BR&gt;• Chic projects, well-styled photos, and modern illustrations speak to this increasingly unified audience&lt;BR&gt;• Good, basic, understandable instructions&lt;P&gt;If you&#39;re a quilter experimenting with sewing, or vice versa, the beautiful designs in With Fabric &amp; Thread give you everything you need to bring these two crafts together to make unique and inspired projects." />
