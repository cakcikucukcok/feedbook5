  <title>Dreams to Reality - Mike Healing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Widnes Vikings began 2007 with ambitions of returning to Super League, the top level of domestic Rugby League. A roller-coaster year saw them lift the Northern Rail Cup - their first trophy for several years - play expansive flowing rugby admired by all, but still fail to achieve their ultimate goal. Worse was to come as the club entered Administration and faced the real danger of extinction, prior to being rescued by local businessman Steve O&#39;Connor. Under his dynamic leadership a revitalised and modernised club has reinvigorated its support and is moving with confidence towards achieving one of the cherished Super League Licences for 2009. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This book recalls not only the events &#39;on the pitch&#39; through brief, but detailed reports of each match, from the humble surroundings of Celtic Crusaders Brewery Field on a wintry February evening to the Grand Final at Leeds&#39; Carnegie Stadium, but also covers &#39;off the field&#39; events, including an insight into the complex issue of &#39;Administration&#39;, before moving on to discuss the &#39;new beginning&#39; for a club that was once World Club Champions. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With additional contributions from club officials, players past and present, members of the media and the fans themselves, this is an authoritative account of events at Widnes during 2007. Whether you are closely associated with the Vikings or just a fan of rugby league this will make an interesting read.
