  <title>The Darkening Ecliptic - Ern Malley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1944 the Australian literary world was rocked by a hoax which was to become a worldwide scandal. Ern Malley, deceased motor mechanic and poet, was the invention of two Sydney poets, James McAuley and Harold Stewart, who were intent on proving that modern poetry was a sham.

This definitive edition contains all of the poems, a new introduction by artist Albert Tucker, and historical background by Max Harris, John Reed and Colin Wilson; augmented by the unique contribution of drawings and etchings by Garry Shead." />
