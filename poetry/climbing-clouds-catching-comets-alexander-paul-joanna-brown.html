  <title>Climbing Clouds Catching Comets - Alexander Paul, Joanna Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;To read &lt;strong&gt;Climbing Clouds&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Catching Comets&lt;/strong&gt; is to clamber inside the mind of a writer whose talent fizzes on the page: with love, pain, empathy and a wisdom far beyond his young years. Alexander wrote of the world he knew- a world of stop and search, homelessness, political blackness, big dreams and daunting challenges, crafting all of these into a poetry that transcends them all. The result is this work- at times a journey to find his voice, at times accomplished and masterful, but always a hauntingly beautiful tribute to a truly unique young man.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;~Afua Hirsch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No mother should bury their own child&amp;rdquo; was a saying mother Joanna Brown often heard throughout parenthood. She lived in fear of those words during the fifteen months of supporting her son Alexander Paul, through his battle with terminal brain cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his death, and to honour such a special son, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climbing Clouds, Catching Comets&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; compiled by his mother, whose determination to fulfil his dream of publishing his collection of poems to spread &amp;ldquo;love and blessings&amp;rdquo;, is now a living reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander believed that through expressions of art such as poetry, people could channel their emotions to overcome the clouds and eventually catch comets. As a spoken word performer, Alexander saw a need to &amp;ldquo;minister&amp;rdquo; to young people especially those going through depression or some emotional trauma, through poetic writing. His most prominent poem &amp;ldquo;I am Love&amp;rdquo; sums up his outlook on life. &amp;lsquo;If people had love for each other, there would be less violent and racial crime&amp;rsquo; he would say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander wrote in his diary days after coming out of a coma: -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am Love!&amp;nbsp; Love is pure.&amp;nbsp; Love is stronger than fear.&amp;nbsp; I have no fear!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
