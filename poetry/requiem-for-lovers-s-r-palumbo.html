  <title>Requiem for Lovers - S.R. Palumbo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SUMMERWINDS
If only I could love again
Breathe in again
The sweet smelling
blind unconsciousness
of youth and spring
If only I could sing
again
Live half complete
In every moments
expectation
Knowing
All of life itself
was still ahead
How less than dead
The rest of all the
rest would seem
If only I could dream
again
THE PARABLE
How easy it is to share
nothing with nothing
Hoping something will 
finally come of it
While the anything
of who were are
Wanders here and there 
and everywhere 
Beyond all despairing 
parables
Yet blinded still
and mystified
By sacrifice
And the unconditional
unrelenting
Demands of love
MOONGLOW
We live in the immediacy
of stifled dreams,
Discarded loves that 
circle the moon
In the dead of winters 
benality
The long ride home,
a safeway house
Not far from Spring
And a heartbeat away 
from reality.
SOULMATES
True love
needs only silence.
No words to speak,,,
No need to whisper
cheek to cheek,
For everything
that others might 
not understand
Is understood
emphatically
With just one look:
One glance
within a crowded room
Or far from home,
Each talks to each 
incessantly
And not alone." />
