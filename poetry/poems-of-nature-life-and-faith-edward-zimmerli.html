  <title>Poems of Nature, Life and Faith - Edward Zimmerli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The sweeping nature of the poems in &lt;i&gt;Poems of Nature, Faith, and Life&lt;/i&gt; and the richness of their wisdom portrays the beauty and enormity of nature, life, and spirituality. Author Edward Zimmerlis varied life experiences have provided the foundation for his poetry. He has imbued his writing with the emotions and innermost feelings that each experience awakened in himfrom the beauty of nature to the spirituality of his relationship with God.  
What will it feel like To Brave Lifes Final Door or to experience a beautiful sunrise and the final sunset? This collection explores those emotions, reveling in the splendor of life and faith in all its forms. 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;TO WEAN AND NOURISH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
To wean and nourish are two acts of faith 
To use to keep each other strong. 
Not boasting of our gifts,
Lest we threaten those now finding theirs, 
Or harm them with our pride that holds
them down. 
God will frown on acts that put us high. 
Let Jesus be the brighter star who brings 
Heads round to gaze and wonder. 
And let God say the final truth, 
For we so dimly see that thankful is 
The grandest way that we should be. &lt;/i&gt;" />
