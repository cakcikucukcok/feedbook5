  <title>R.I.P. - Genevieve Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="R.I.P. is a compilation of poetic tributes for young people who died between 20092014.
Some of them died accidental deaths through drowning, car accidents; however, sadly most of them died because of the senseless violence on Chicago streets and some neighboring cities. The ideal is to pay tribute to their lives. I hope that these tributes about each individual show how much they were loved before tragically dying. I hope it will bring some comfort.
Through making these tributes, I hope to memorialize them. Each individual has a different story. I noticed that when someone was murdered, their loved ones paid tribute to them by putting flowers, candles, teddy bears, and letters with messages of (R.I.P.) Rest in Peace. They didnt want anybody to forget how their loved one died. They didnt want anybody to forget their names or those left behind of family and friends who loved them. Some were deaths that caused a lot of controversy in which politicians and ministers got involved. These young people are not the well-known youths who have remained forthright in the news for lengthy periods. The idea of these tributes is to say You will never be forgotten.
 These young people had families, dreams, aspirations, and futures that were cut short. This is condolences to families possibly still grieving the loss of their loved ones.
Though poetically done, I do not, by any means, take their deaths lightly. Each of them brought tears to my eyes. One of those young men (Michael Patton) died on the street in the rain. A stranger came out of his home along with his wife to comfort and assist him. I read about it and thought that it was too sad and decided not to write about him. However, one night as I was about to go to sleep, I clearly heard someone say I didnt die alone. I tried to ignore it, but I kept hearing it until I got up and wrote a tribute that I called I Didnt Die Alone. 
So yes, sometimes I heard them speak to me spiritually. They will not be forgotten." />
