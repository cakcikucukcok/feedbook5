  <title>He Who Calls Is Faithful - Vicki Alicia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;HE WHO CALLS IS FAITHFUL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of this book is based on the promises and faithfulness of a gracious and loving God, who calls us out of bondage and brokenness into a glorious covenant relationship with Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all who may be broken-hearted, battered and bruised by a life of confusion, misunderstanding and fear, take courage, because God is a loving Heavenly Father who knows us intimately and loves us with an unfathomable love. When we acknowledge who He is and step out in faith, He leads us into a wonderfully personal relationship full of joy, peace and promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call of God is not only to those who need His healing touch in their lives but unto all who have been blessed with stability, love and peace in their family relationships, so that they may help others less fortunate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any who truly desire to comfort the lonely and broken hearted and to lead them to a place of peace and security will be encouraged by this book. The author has bravely exposed the truth about the pattern of abuse in her life and her desire to see others set free from bondage and fear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear not for you will no longer live in shame. Your creator will be your husband, for the Lord has called you back from your grief.  Isaiah 54 chapters 4, 5 &amp; 6). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer  Father God, you heard my cry of desperation and answered with love, mercy and grace, lifting me from the depths of fear, confusion and frustration, to a place where I could enjoy comfort, peace and joy. May all who have the opportunity to read my life story, be inspired and encouraged to trust you with their lives so that You Lord may pour out your love and blessings upon them.  Amen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
