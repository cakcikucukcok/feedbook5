  <title>Where the Rubber Hits the Road in This Game They Call Life - Steve Wordsmith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dont give up till you reach the end, or you will miss the message.
Introduction
My poems are inspired by lifes experience, the good times and the
not so good times. Recapping significant bits of life and events that
have absolutely no significance at all. Sometimes one of my poems
will introduce a life changing truth next will lead you down the
garden path to some humorous event thats really out for a laugh.
I suppose its not really fair to play with the dynamics of peoples
emotions but lifes not always fair. Anyway if your reading my book
and it has touched you enough to move your mind away from reality
for a short time it has achieved the desired result. And also paid a
small amount to help feed my family. This will also give me the
opportunity to write another verse that just may be the poem that
touches the hearts of the people that needs a slight encouragement 
at that particular momentso dont get up off the lounge or out of
that comfy chair." />
