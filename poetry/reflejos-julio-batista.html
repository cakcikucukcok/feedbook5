  <title>Reflejos - Julio Batista</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reflejos
Reflejos is a book of poetry written in Spanish.   It is divided in different sections. The first section is dedicated to his native Panama. It mentions well known places where the author grew up and gets his inspiration whenever he visits.   The second section was written with solidarity in mind for events in other countries of the world that have made an impact in history.  For example there is a poem called Ayotzinapa about 43 students that disappeared in Mexico and have not been found.  There is another called Las Mariposas that is about the Mirabal Sisters killed in the Dominican Republic in 1961.  This horrible tragedy brought about the end of the dictatorship of Trujillo.   There is a poem about Malala, a school girl that had to escape her native country after been persecuted and shot by the Taliban just because she was promoting education.  There is a section calledEl poeta suea y suea(the poet dreams) this section has poems of different topics, places and events captured during his trips to other countries.   There is a section dedicated to pay posthumous homage to famous people, friends and family members whom he remembers fondly.  This section is to honor and celebrate their lives and a way to remember them forever. In this last section for example, he dedicates a poem called Gumercindo Sanchez to his great- grandfather who raised him until he moved to the USA and another called Jordan in the memory of a friend who committed suicide recently.     The book: Reflejos is about nature, people, music, love, hate, human passions and world tragedies. Each of course has its own story to tell. Enjoy!" />
