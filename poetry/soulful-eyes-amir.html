  <title>Soulful Eyes - Amir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="soulful eyes is a collection of poetry, showing many years of growth, evolution, and change.  soulful eyes is the tip of the iceberg, scratching just enough of my mind for you to get a taste of my thoughts.  Ive never professed to be a great writer, but over the years, my talent as a writer and a poet has been fashioned and molded far beyond my wildest dreams. Ive always been a private person, from birth, and sharing my work with the world was never a real thought until a few years ago.  Thats when I learned that my writing impacted more lives that I thought, so here we are, years later, with the finished product, I am very proud of my accomplishment and of my work.  I write a lot, and theres plenty more where soulful eyes came from.  I write from the heart and soul, with every line I strive to let my true feelings and emotions show.  At the end of every poem, I am pleased, and I try to convey that same positive spirit to my readers.  Lots of love, planning, and dedication went into this book, and I hope that you enjoy reading soulful eyes.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A little introduction to the excerpt from soulful eyes: &lt;b&gt;carefree&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carefree was written with my college years in mind...when you were finding yourself and trying to get a grasp on life...When struggles and hardships were just a figment of your imagination and you were living in the moment everyday instead of just day to day, or paycheck to paycheck...
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope you enjoy reading soulful eyes as much as I enjoyed writing and putting the pieces together to create my first book of poetry.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for taking the time out to read my work...I appreciate it greatly.  Publishing soulful eyes is a dream come true for me, and those of you who know me know how hard Ive worked and how hard I continue to work, because this is only the first step..." />
