  <title>Poetry&#39;s Heart to Heal the Soul - Lisa K. Maier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Poetry&#39;s heart to heal the soul&lt;/I&gt; is based on some very touching inspirational things I have gone through in my life. With god as a guide and a light, I&#39;ve been through many things and everything I&#39;ve gone through I put it into love I call poetry, it&#39;s about good times and bad but always a meaning to explain life at that particular moment in time. It is a passion I have for life and the miracle it stands to be that I put into words. I see life kind of like music and a dream, and the power to create our own fate. A lot of it is gratitude for where I stand and my love to serve in this world, my wishes to help. Some of this literature is on religion some on limitless love, emotions I call a dimension on so many levels and outlooks I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s poetry. When I write it&#39;s like my mind is filled with words and an understanding that I put to words in hope to interest or love in someway. I hope it is like a piece to a puzzle in some way or justice or helps someone to see life differently in a good way. &lt;/P&gt;" />
