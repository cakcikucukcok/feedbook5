  <title>Rainbow in My Heart - Basit Olatunji</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The moon comes out like a dot and emboldens one to move into a universal light with periodic renewal. Basit Olatunji&#39;s evolution with this piece has a similar metamorphosis with the moon. Perhaps, the fact that both deal with the principles of space is one reason for both to follow the same process. 
The colours of rainbow are said to be seven, but are they? Do we have to differentiate between blue and purple, orange and yellow? Yes, a combination of two gives birth to one and more and more. Thus, in a rainbow, colours are buried in other colours, giving birth to more colours. So the genre employed by Olatunji is the very best medium for the depth of messages carried in his rainbow heart. The tip of the tongue alone does not convey taste. It takes the depth of the palate to really savour something. This rainbow in the poet&#39;s heart has many colours: life, love, hope, and despair. Indeed, the colours are not limited to red colour of love as expressed in A Woman in Her Prime or My Ladylove Was Not So Tough or My Eternal Valentina; it also delves into deep relationship topics both positive and negative.
The poems in this work, Rainbow in My Heart, are words that have set the Lonely Mind of the poet free from the untamable storms within the walls of prison of thoughts. It is a pet with colours of rainbow as patches spotting its tiger like veracious messages all over. Rainbow in My Heart will relieve readers as it does the poet of some burden of thoughts.
