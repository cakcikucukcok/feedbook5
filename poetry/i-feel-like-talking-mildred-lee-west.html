  <title>I Feel Like Talking - Mildred Lee West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written in hopes that many will be blessed and encouraged to live life to the fullness, and that they will know that even during many struggles, there are also signature moments; therefore, we must learn to cherish, and always be thankful for even the little things that are put before us to bring a smile, if only for a little while. Simple things like, when you are very busy and in a hurry trying to wash your dishes and your dishcloth seems to play tricks on you. When you reach for the dishcloth, you notice that it seems to have jumped off of the counter and into the sudsy dishwater; therefore, appears to be peeking through the bubbles as if it might be hiding from the sound of the ringing phone. Smile, and dont be alarmed, for its not time for a Psychiatrist yet! These things happen to people of all kind, when theres too much on the mind.
A quick glance of yesteryears of love ones gone on before, sometimes it brings to our eyes many tears, but always take that second glance to see the smiles on their faces that was given by Gods Eternal grace. Glance into yesteryears with joyful hearts, knowing that love ones, no longer have fears nor do they have the pains that caused many tears.
To death, who am I to with stand? I am also a visitor on foreign land. 
To rain, to sleet, to snow, many times together, they all will show. Acts of nature, this we all know.
To shy, to cry, to refuse to say good-bye, these things, we will try.
To die, who am I to wonder why?" />
