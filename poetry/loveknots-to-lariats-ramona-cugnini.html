  <title>Loveknots to Lariats - Ramona Cugnini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loveknots to Lariats &lt;/em&gt;presents a collection of poetry that was written over a period of fifty years and covers most of the eight-four years of poet Ramona Cugninis life. In these verses, she writes about love and life in general, taking you deep into cowboy country, where she has spent her entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The poetry in the section called Lighter Side reflects the imagination of Cugnini as she considers popular nursery rhymes, while the verses in the Lariats section consider the life of cowboys, their culture, and lifestyle. Her insightful poetry touches on many aspects of love and life with wisdom and humor and explains the history of life as the cowboys lived it in the west. Her verse also recalls some of her favorite places, such as Mesa Verde National Park and the Durango-Silverton Narrow Gauge Train.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thoughtful, personal collection of verse gathered across most of one womans life offers a glimpse into her life and loves and provides a wide range of exploration for anyone to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
