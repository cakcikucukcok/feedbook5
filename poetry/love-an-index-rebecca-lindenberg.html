  <title>Love, an Index - Rebecca Lindenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;A man disappears. The woman who loves him is left scarred and haunted. In her fierce, one-of-a-kind debut, Rebecca Lindenberg tells the story&amp;#151;in verse&amp;#151;of her passionate relationship with Craig Arnold, a much-respected poet who disappeared in 2009 while hiking a volcano in Japan. Lindenberg&amp;#8217;s billowing, I-contain-multitudes style lays bare the poet&amp;#8217;s sadnesses, joys, and longings in poems that are lyric and narrative, at once plainspoken and musically elaborate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regarding her role in Arnold&amp;#8217;s story, Lindenberg writes with clear-eyed humility and endearing dignity: &amp;#147;The girl with the ink-stained teeth / knows she&amp;#8217;s famous / in a tiny, tragic way. / She&amp;#8217;s not / daft, after all.&amp;#8221; And then later, playfully, of her travels in Italy with the poet, her lover: &amp;#147;The carabinieri / wanted to know if there were bears / in our part of America. Yes, we said, / many bears. Man-eating bears? Yes, of course, / many man-eating bears.&amp;#8221; Every poem in this collection bursts with humor, pathos, verve&amp;#151;and an utterly unique, soulful voice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This widely anticipated debut, already selected as a finalist for several prominent book awards, marks the first collection in the newly minted McSweeney&amp;#8217;s Poetry Series. MPS is an imprint which seeks to publish a broad range of excellent new poetry collections in exquisitely designed hardcovers&amp;#151;poetry that&amp;#8217;s useful and meaningful to anyone in any walk of life.&lt;/div&gt;" />
