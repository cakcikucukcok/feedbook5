  <title>Fragile Reality - George Schnaider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The inspiration for my poetry is God. God has given me many blessings, and among these, God has blessed me with a unique understanding of life. Most of us, if not all of us, go through life seeing things that we dont understand happen. I was like that as well.
However, one day I came to understand life. I came to understand why things happened to me in the past. I came to understand why things are happening to me now, and I came to understand what to expect in the future.
A person gets hit by a car and survives. Or a person skydives from ten thousand feet, their parachute doesnt open, and yet they survive. People are quick to say that that person was lucky. They werent lucky. Luck had nothing to do with it. They survived because they were saved by God. I too have a story like that to tell.
On November 3, 1984, I was walking home on the shoulder of a road when I was hit from behind by a car. I suffered seven fractures to my left leg, four fractures to my pelvis, and a closed head injury. I spent three weeks in a coma, four weeks connected to a lifesupport machine, seven months in the hospital, and two and a half years in rehabilitation.
I eventually came out of coma, and I recovered to a point where I could live a normal life, although I lost my sense of smell due to my brain damage. I did this because I was saved by God, not because I was lucky. That experience gave me a greater appreciation of life and an incredible desire to seek a relationship with God. I have achieved both, and both have been inspirational in the poems I have written. I hope that you will enjoy them. God bless you." />
