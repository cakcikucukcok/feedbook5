  <title>Heart and Soul Truths - Carmen Marsala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I pray that if you are suffering from dis-ease in your life, you will discover a journey that works for you. Your life can be different, and you too can experience miracles. &lt;br /&gt;
I chose to embark on a 12 Step Program of recovery for my spiritual journey. I use the tools suggested by the program and it continues to work for me. The God of my understanding has gifted me beyond my imagination; obtaining my License as an Addiction Counselor, professionally working with others who suffer from dis-ease. Witnessing the miracles of other men and women working the program, coming in wrapped tightly in their cocoon, and over time, One Day at a Time, emerging as the butterfly, they were meant to be. &lt;br /&gt;
My heart and soul were buried with shame, guilt, fear, no self-esteem, self-loathing, depression, and other self-defeating thoughts and learned messages. My alcoholism brought me to the suicide of my heart and soul. My spiritual journey is a work in progress, the women in the program loved me until I could love myself. I respect myself and others, I value my worth, I am deserving, and I am basking in the sunlight of the spirit. &lt;br /&gt;
I have learned to separate my religion and my spirituality. I found my God who is loving, nurturing and forgiving, I know He chose me to live a life full of love and forgiveness for myself and those I cross paths with. I know the God of my understanding wants me to be Happy, Joyous and Free. &lt;br /&gt;
I pray you will discover your own path of healing and learn to live life on lifes terms. I hope you can relate to my shared experiences, strength and hope within these pages. My wish for you is to join me as a walking miracle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
