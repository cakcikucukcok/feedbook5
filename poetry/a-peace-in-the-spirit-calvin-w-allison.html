  <title>A Peace in the Spirit - Calvin W. Allison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="So many people turn to the things of the world for 
their source of comfort. Be it movies, music, sports, liquor,
drugs, or whatever can keep them motivated, they seek
after diverse pleasures to keep them content. But in the 
end, they find themselves unfulfilled. Still longing
for something more.
     Then there are those who find fulfillment. Those 
who come out of the world and put their faith in God.
They allow Him to lead and guide their lives. These have
hope and are fulfilled. They find peace.
     Calvin W. Allison, the author of &quot;Joan&quot; and &quot;A Sunset 
Rising,&quot; used to seek after those things of the world and 
knows all too well where that broken road leads. Now, a
Christian, he seeks after the things of God. Closely 
following the Lord&#39;s lead. 
     &quot;A Peace in the Spirit&quot; is his second volume of 
Christian poetry. His poems are written with strong
conviction and purpose." />
