  <title>A Grand Quilt of Life - Jerelynn Hsu Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this poetry collection, author Jerelynn Hsu Lee offers a contemplative reflection on the experiences of an Asian American immigrant within and beyond the United States. Through lyrical verse, she considers a wide variety of subjects that come together to form the patchwork of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories presented in these verses embrace a multicultural nation where several languages are spoken. They depict a world that is gradually merging into a digital universe, examining it from neither the outside nor the inside but from its doorstep, seen from the perspective of someone adjacent to but not involved in information technology. Through the voices of words, numbers, data, memories, and even alphabets, Jerelynn considers the various systems that control our lives and those that might lead us to a different future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Grand Quilt of Life&lt;/p&gt;
Stories of our lives&lt;/br&gt;
Were cut into patches of fabric&lt;/br&gt;
In iridescent colors,&lt;/p&gt;
Every piece fair and square,&lt;/br&gt;
Sewed together many lives,&lt;/br&gt;
A grand quilt of life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
