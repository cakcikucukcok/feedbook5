  <title>Godspeak - Larry Joseph Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; God knew you from the&lt;br&gt;
foundation of the world.&lt;br&gt;
It has been the same for every&lt;br&gt;
man, woman, boy, and girl.&lt;br&gt;
The path you choose is the one&lt;br&gt;
closest to your heart,&lt;br&gt;
but the way you end can be&lt;br&gt;
different from the way you start &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Joseph Sr. has always pursued Gods voice and direction for his life. With that in mind, he shares an inspirational compilation of poetry, prayers, and dedications intended to honor not only God, but also those who have positively impacted his life and society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph begins with poetry that encourages spiritual seekers to look inward and reflect on their faith, the role of God in their lives, and the symbolism of the Cross. As Joseph transitions from poetry into prayers, he offers inspiration for times of hopelessness, reconciliation, repentance, and gratitude. Joseph concludes his collection with dedications that reflect on several prominent figures in todays society as well as the importance of freedom, perseverance, and unconditional love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Godspeak&lt;/I&gt; shares one mans reflections on his journey through life as he lovingly embraces faith, family, and a modern worlds challenges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
