      <meta name="description" content="This eclectic compilation of poetry greatly ranges in terms of style and content.  The author, Alton James, reveals a command of words, phrasing, rhythm, and sound in a way that penetrates the heart.  Anyone can feel the emotions and images that he conveys through this magnificent collection of poetry.  Mr. James evokes the language and ideas from early British and American authors.

Along with his craft of language, Mr. James intertwines his musicality and musical identity into his work.  His multitude of experiences gives a depth and breadth to his work that is salient and original.  While the styling changes quite frequently within and between selections, one thing is for certain.  Alton James presents a fresh form of poetry that is real, raw, and ready to be revealed and received." />
