  <title>Beloved, We Are One - Lee McEachern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1996, during a period of questioning and evaluating his life up to that date, Lee McEachern took to heart spiritual writings he had read which emphasized the fastest way to lasting love, real peace, and happinessand maybe even Godwas through the eternal flame of love and something happened. Lee felt like he was just a regular guy, but he had experienced something extraordinary that was out of this world and absolutely beyond words. Trusting in the Beloved (with a capital B), he made a connection to a Oneness of Love, then he spent three years creating his own spiritual writings (something that he had never done before) trying to describe the peace, love, and joy that he had glimpsed. He felt he knew that it resided at the center of our beingat the center of the being of everyone and everything. He knew the Beloved was in all of us. What if I can get them to see a spark of that infinitely loving Oneness? he thought. But after three years of teaching Oneness poetry, he stopped or at least tried to, because the normal, regular, real world needed his attention. His wife and son needed his attention. In early 2013 Lee read Dr. Eben Alexanders book, Proof of Heaven. His fascinating and strong message of an infinitely loving Oneness that is here now...and more real than anything we can perceive with our physical senses...made Lee think of his own teaching Oneness poetry. In his book Dr. Alexander wrote, We are connected as One through our divine link with God. Lee thought, His whole book resonates with what I experienced and what I was trying to describe back in the 90s. If a well educated, well respected neurosurgeon and scientist can stick his neck out and share his unorthodox oneness-of-love experience, then I will too! So, Lee dusted off the old poems, added a few newer ones (remember, he said he tried to stop!). and here you have Beloved, we are One. (Thank you, Dr. Alexander, for giving me the nudge I needed to move forward.  Lee)&lt;/p&gt;" />
