  <title>I, Spectrum - Evelyn Eve</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From my early years as a young boy under the name of Randall to growing up into the effeminate thing named Ev and everywhere in-between, poetry has always been there for Me even when I have not.  It is in stanza and verse that I go to church, and in meter and pace I find my pulse.  Rhyme for me breaks the monotony of everyday life.  Sanity is crammed hard within the tight spaces between the confining and restrictive lines of madness, seeking to break apart the chaos and form from the hideous fragments something beautiful and orderly.  This meeting of black and white to create an entire range of colors and greys is what makes poetry such a precious thing to many.  
Contained within this book is a wide and diverse collection of works: a full prism of love and hate, selfishness and unity, faith and unbelief.  What you have, then, is something human.  Even in the lies of a scoundrel, you find the truth of characterand in the sharpest reality of a wise man, you find the foggiest illusions.  Here I present to you my latest work of poetry called I, Spectrum.  I release this little monster into the world and smile, as It is the closest thing to a human being I have ever made.  Fear it, love it, hate it...do what you will with it.  It is here!" />
