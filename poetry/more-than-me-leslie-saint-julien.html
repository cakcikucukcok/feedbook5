  <title>More Than Me - Leslie Saint-Julien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Put on your spiritual lenses and prepare to comb through the pages of lifes love, pain and joy. Open your mind to culture and open your soul to adventure. This collection of poetry, thoughts and songs are the real life painted experiences of Leslie Saint-Julien. For the first time ever, Leslie invites us to look into her mirror and stare as she tells you what she sees. For the first time ever, this young woman is speaking with her soul and instructing the world to hear with their heart her every word. There are many tones and emotions expressed in this collection of writings which is why More Than Me means more than you imagine.  To know love, to know pain and to know joy is the journey of this book. 
More Than Me compels you to go deeper into yourself and explore the corners of your soul that have yet to be introduced to you. More Than Me was arranged at a time where Leslie realized that she was not alone as she navigated through life and overcame so many obstacles. She realized that God has been and will always be with her at every step on her pathway and it is more than her own efforts that have gotten her to where she is today.  Finding a love that makes you want to sing, enduring a painful experience that makes you a strong giant and feeling such joy that it seems like a summer breeze even on the coldest day. This is more than you think and more than you. This is More Than Me." />
