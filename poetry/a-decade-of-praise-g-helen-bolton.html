&lt;b&gt;Book Review&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            My friend Helen Bolton, who was a Port Arthur ISD teacher for three decades before retiring and moving to Brady, has written a book that is truly &lt;i&gt;A Decade of Praise&lt;/i&gt;. Filled prolifically with her daily thoughts and prayers expressed in simple rhyme schemes, &lt;i&gt;A Decade of Praise&lt;/i&gt; presents all the situations in which we find ourselves and reveals how one can face them squarely with the help and asked-for presence of God. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She writes graphically about both the highs and lows of life, constantly praising God for the help she finds in meditation, prayer and scripture. Her words serve as a spiritual guide that will help us see ourselves and evaluate the path we are taking toward a meaningful and purposeful life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Each of her hundreds of prayers is referenced with verses from the Bible, ranging from The Potter and the Clay, (Isaiah 64:8) to The Darkest Night (John 17:11), and everything in-between. A favorite of this writer is Heal Our Land, based on 2 Chronicles 7:14.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            Helen taught students from fifth grade through college in settings as diverse as American schools overseas to Texas youth correctional facilities during her long teaching career. She published 10 collections of poetry and designed greeting cards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           &lt;i&gt; A Decade of Praise&lt;/i&gt; is published by Xlibris, and is available from Xlibris, amazon.com, and Barnes and Noble.
