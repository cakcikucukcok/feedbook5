   Review
This latest compilation of poetry sincerely reflects the writers love of God, care of family, and concern for friends. Amazingly what is difficult to say is expressed effortlessly, passionately, and without apology through poetry. The poets release from their innermost being powerful and poignant poetic imagery that clearly comes from the heart of their creator, and much like the book of Psalms which man calls poetry, Mother Aysha Youngblood-Moses as she is affectionately known pens songs of worship and praise!
