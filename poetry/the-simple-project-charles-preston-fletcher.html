  <title>The Simple Project - Charles Preston Fletcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a handy chair-side companion to help you with re-discovering the simple joys of life. These are lessons that the author has used in his own life and wishes to share with you. The Simple Project includes love of oneself and others, the use of positive life attitudes, and always a sense of gratitude. The topics of love, gratitude, hope, and inspiration are just a few of the tools that we will use on our journey to re-discover the Simple Joys of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start out our lives with a strong sense of simple curiosity. We lose the joy to be found in simple things themselves. The Simple Project helps us to get some of that joy back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best of life is found in faith: the strength of our faith in God, the strength of our faith in others, and the strength of our faith in ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both our love and our faith are strengthened by never giving up. At some point in our lives, many of us come to realize that it is the strength we find in the selfless love of Jesus Christ that is all that has held us up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The journey of self-discovery can be frightening, exhilarating, confusing, liberating, and often best undertaken accompanied by a caring voice. Charles Prestons poetry shiningly serves as such a voice for all who wish to begin a journey of their own. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Suzanne Beeson, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project to simplify our lives is where we find the miracles of life. Our lives are a gift that weve been given simply by the living of them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
