  <title>A Joyful Noise - Amy Santi Bull</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When troubles arise the first thing we do is pray. We ask the Lord to quickly relieve the pain and suffering of the situation. But how often do we send up prayers of praise and thanksgiving? Let Amy Santi Bulls forty-five poems in this collection lead you on the path to showing the Lord how grateful you are for all He has done in your life.
As in her other books, Believe and My Inner Strength, each poem in A Joyful Noise has five Bible verses that coincide with the meaning of the poem. These verses are listed in the Reference section following the poetry and show that praise and thanksgiving were offered to the Lord throughout time.
So now, do you have a reason to be thankful? Do you have answered prayers? Then give the Lord the praises He deserves and let Amys poetry guide you along the way." />
