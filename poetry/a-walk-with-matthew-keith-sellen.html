  <title>A Walk with Matthew - Keith Sellen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Walk with Matthew is a poetic journey through the Gospel of Matthew, written through the lens of a believer who, like every believer, has been grafted into an extraordinary family. The author begins with the Gospel writers thesisthat those (however ordinary or unlikely) who believe in Jesus are grafted into the family of the Kingand reveals through poetry how the life and teachings of Jesus transform us as they did Matthew and the other disciples.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The book grew out of the authors desire for a more genuine, intimate, meaningful, and joyful relationship with Jesus and to become more useful to Jesus in His ministry. The strategy was to go back to the basics. In this case, it was the Gospel of Matthew. The book is an interpretation of the Gospel that grew out of the authors own relationship with Jesus and his challenges living out that relationship in his family, community, and public service.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It is the authors hope that this book will motivate the reader to engage the Gospel message, reflect on the text and meaning of the scripture, understand all the good that the Gospel presents, pursue the transformation of being grafted into Jesus pedigree, grow more confident in eternal life, and be joyfully content in this life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
