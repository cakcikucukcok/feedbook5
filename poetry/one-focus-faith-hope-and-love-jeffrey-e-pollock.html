  <title>One Focus (Faith, Hope and Love) - Jeffrey E. Pollock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jeff Pollock&#39;s poetry is inspired by the only truth worth living and dying for in this mixed up world.  Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.  There is one way to the Father and His Son Jesus Christ our Lord proved He is it!
The Old Testament book of Isaiah says God keeps in perfect peace those who believe in Him and trust Him completely. A steady following, feeding, and focus on Jesus Christ brings peace to fruition, full enjoyment! No one deserves peace, no self-help guru or relaxation technique will give it; Gods peace is beyond understanding, though it is available to everyone. In faith invite him into your heart and begin to know Heavens peace, an eternal by-product of our decision to trust Him for salvation.
Gods grace and ultimately His peace entered Jeffs life through the eyes and heart of a  beautiful redhead named Evelyn. The moment he looked in her eyes his life and ultimately his destiny changed. Right then and there he wrote her a love poem to Jesus, and God opened every door and made their love complete, complete in Him!  
This collection of original Christian poetry is based on Holy Scripture and written to encourage believers in their faith. Inspired by the courageous love of the author&#39;s wife, Evelyn, and the ever-faithful promises of our Savior Jesus Christ, this personal journal of encouragement is a work of heart and temporary tribute to His eternal grace and glory. Birthed in a genuine &quot;born again&quot; experience of love these heartfelt poems express a deep desire to know God more and experience Him in every aspect of life. 
Hope you will enjoy!" />
