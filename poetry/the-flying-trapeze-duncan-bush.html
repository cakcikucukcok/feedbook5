  <title>The Flying Trapeze - Duncan Bush</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the most significant voices of his generation from Wales, a new book by Duncan Bush is an eagerly awaited event. The Flying Trapeze, his sixth poetry collection and the first to appear after his notable &#39;Midway&#39;, is characteristically unsentimental, tough-minded, and fiercely lyrical. Many poems are inspired by places he has lived in or travelled to including: Australia, Greece, Germany, France, Luxembourg and the United States. In &#39;Avedon&#39;s Drifters&#39; he chronicles marginal lives as portrayed in masterly black and white photographs: vagrants, gypsies, minor criminals, the burnt-out, the bereft. In contrast there are poems like &#39;A Blood Rose&#39; steeped in the full-blooded colours of the tango, and &#39;Golden Girl&#39; in praise of superlative athletes. There is also a touch of bitter political satire in pieces like &#39;Mitterand&#39;s Last Supper&#39;, &#39;A Season in Sarajevo&#39; and &#39;Lahore&#39;. There are some fine, unexpected nature poems, which pinpoint the tension in his poetry between a sensual rapture and a knowing cynicism. The Flying Trapeze is an excellent new collection, never less than subtle, smart and true." />
