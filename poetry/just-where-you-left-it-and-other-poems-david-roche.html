  <title>Just Where You Left It... and Other Poems - David Roche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just Where You Left It... and other Poems&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of humorous poetry about how to survive school, parents and everything else that&#39;s unfair in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From David Roche come these simple and charming rhymes designed to make parents and children alike fall in love with poetry again... or maybe for the first time. It all started with a poem about the agony of poetry recitation, written by David for his son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, all of these poems were written for his three sons, touching on everything they might encounter growing up: exams, school meals, bullying, sports days, embarrassing Dads and nagging and know-it-all Mums were fair game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are poems for parents, poems for children and poems for parents to read to their children, offering a witty and charming take on life for every stage of growing up. If you grew up in a world of Ogden Nash and Shel Silverstein, then this is the book for you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
