  <title>Pocket Poetry - Fritzie.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is something most writers could do without. The part of writing about your life. I mean, you see my Poetry and have already some kind of knowledge about me in front of you, because all the things Ive written about are part of the experience which shaped my life so far. So, some hard facts are necessary that you can make up your mind and consider what all this is about. I was born 1960 in West Germany in a small countryside village near the border to the then GDR, nothing but forest and nature. My parents owned a bakery and a pub, all in the house we were living in, with my three siblings and my grandparents. I was married for 22 years and have four children and four grandchildren. I stayed at home when my children where little, had my own ironing and catering business in our house; later I was cashier in a wonderful bookshop, then moved on to Housekeeping, to use my education and be a professional Home Economic Manager and Domestic Science Trainer, first all over Germany, a bit in Norway and since 2007 in London and the Cotswolds. The nickname Fritzie ( by the way the first nickname I ever had and immensely proud of it) is easy to read and speak, which is not always the case with German names, hence the reason of its use." />
