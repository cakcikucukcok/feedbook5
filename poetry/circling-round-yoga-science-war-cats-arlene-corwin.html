  <title>Circling Round Yoga, Science, War &amp; Cats - Arlene Corwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Circling Round Yoga, Science, War &amp; Cats is a book of four poetry collections, each intended to express the universal; a unity in variety.  
Ms. Corwin: In Circling Round Yoga, Ive circled around varieties of yoga by including such subjects as recipes, thoughts about cooking, meditative reflections and recommendations, direct, unsystematic and definitely incomplete; recommendations for getting rid of loneliness: ideas that circle around the diverse paths of yoga.
In Circling Round Science it was hard to draw a line between the intuitive, the spiritual, the philosophic and the scientific.  Sometimes I feel like a combination charlatan-cum-dilettante with nothing to use but limited knowledge and intuition.
I loved words like ionized, fractal, little green men from Mars, unified theory, red shift, continuumthey were oases of inspiration; an overlap of poetic speculations and quasi-science.
War Book is self-explanatory.  Its anti-. It may moan a bit.  A killing phenomenon unjustifiable, despicable, one is impelled to say something.  
And finally Cat Book, a collection based on lovingly unsentimental observations of the only cats Ive known: Sootis and Albert, who were and are more than a mice eliminating part of my life." />
