  <title>Selected Later Poems - C. K. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A selection from the last twenty years of C. K. Williams&#39;s career, plus new work--proof of his enduring power&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;C. K. Williams&#39;s long career has been a catalog of surprises, of inventions and reinventions, of honors. His one constant is a remarkable degree of flexibility, a thrilling ability to shape-shift that goes hand in hand with an essential, enduring honesty. This rare, heady mix has ensured that William&#39;s verses have remained, from book to book, as fresh and vibrant as they were when he first burst onto the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Selected Later Poems&lt;/i&gt;--a generous selection of the last two decades of Williams&#39;s poetry, capped by a gathering of new work--is a testament to that enduring vibrancy. Here are the passionate, searching, clear-eyed explorations of empathy in &lt;i&gt;The Vigil&lt;/i&gt;; here is the candor and revelation of &lt;i&gt;Repair&lt;/i&gt;; here is the agonizing morality of &lt;i&gt;The Singing&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wait&lt;/i&gt;, and the unsparing reflections on aging of &lt;i&gt;Writers Writing Dying&lt;/i&gt;; here are the poignant prose vignettes of &lt;i&gt;All at Once&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams&#39;s poetry is essential because its lyric beauty, precise and revealing images, and elegant digressions are coupled to a conscience both uneasy and unflinching. &lt;i&gt;Selected Later Poems &lt;/i&gt;is at once a celebration of Williams&#39;s career, an affirmation of his continued position in the pantheon of American poets, and a kind of reckoning--a reminder of the ways in which art can serve both beauty and justice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
