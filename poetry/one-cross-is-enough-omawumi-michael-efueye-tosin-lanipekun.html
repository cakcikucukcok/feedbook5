  <title>One Cross Is Enough - Omawumi Michael Efueye, Tosin Lanipekun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One Cross Is Enough, the title poem in this anthology, reflects on the deep-seated anguish of soul felt by the repeated betrayal of a loved one. The anxiety shared by patients in The Waiting Room of a doctors clinic and the jitters one feels before The Operation are equally intense. Treachery and exploitation are counterbalanced by love, sacrifice, and hope in the epic saga of The Bridge. If all these seem a little too ardent for your taste, maybe you could lose yourself in the playful Tired But Not Exhausted, the comic tale of The Atheist and the Bear, and the story of the hapless vicar in Mistimed. From the philosophical Maybe There Is No God, to limericks, sonnets, odes, and comic poems with a punch line, diverse genres of poetry are explored with the central perspective of faith. This is a guaranteed delightful reading even to novices to poetry." />
