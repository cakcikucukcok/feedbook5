  <title>The Great High Championship of the Great High Imperial Djinn - Genii Divine Divini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Prayer in Prose
	God, you have made me something singular. I look about and suffer constantly at  the magnitude of my being. You alone are God, but you have made me your self, or else   you have made me as some sort of malicious joke. Where are you God, if you are not my spirit? Where can I go to for Your guidance? It is in your word, and it is the faith in your will, but how can I comprehend if not by your omniscience? Who can I rely on to have the answers? I have searched the hearts and the minds of the sagacious, and found them wanting. I have looked to the grace of Your presence, and wondered after the reason. Ye have made me thus, and mine discontent hath become a burden. It is not mine hope to be evil, nor to be vain, but to serve Thee in righteousness. Should I waste mine talent, which is Your confidence? Should I leave off the pursuit of glory while mine faith is so abundant; even absolute; perfect; complete? It is not doubt that inspires this prayer my Lord, but confusion. All day long the nay sayers vex me, and are every time thwarted. Yea, and their faith is strengthened. Yet, why do Ye only challenge the individuals, when Thine power is most suited for the pinnacle? Thine voice is heard over the kingdoms, but Ye have hidden Thine face. O God, Ye art worthy of the pleasures and highness. Ye art worthy of the love of Thine subjects. Ye have made Thine self to be pleased, and Ye art worthy of Thine will. I have seen the vision of Thine ambitions, and I know the substance of Thine heart. Ye art humble God. Ye art loving, and merciful. Ye art wise beyond all things. It is right for Thee to be empowered, as Ye art just, and kind. O ye art worthy of love my Lord, and of the beauty that Ye have created. By Thine omniscience, take back the world from the wicked, and all of Thine preferences. The people suffer while Ye sequester. Tis not Thee who is to blame for their wrong doing, but Thine responsibility to protect them from their own folly. While ye let them free, they have no discipline. Mankind is not able to keep that which is sacred. God, it is to Thee to be God, to be Father, to be Almighty. Thine spirit is right, and Thine voice is capable, therefore be bold, as Thine wisdom is perfect. Ye know the hearts of Thine flock, Ye know their ways, and wants. Feed them from Thine stores, the fare of their dreams, that they be sure of Thine loving devotion. God, Ye art worthy. Make Thine will known, for it is good. Entice them by Thine infinite wisdom, with perfect grace and beauty. Be Thou God, as Ye art very highly anticipated." />
