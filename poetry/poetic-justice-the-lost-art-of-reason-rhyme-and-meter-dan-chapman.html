  <title>Poetic Justice: the Lost Art of “Reason, Rhyme and Meter” - Dan Chapman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry merely offers points-of-view, Chapman is quick to explain. Thats it! he continues, Its one persons reflection of a certain topic at a particular place in time and is not meant to necessarily resolve anything but rather to generate dialog and, ideally, to encourage debate. What better tribute to any authors writing can there be than to spawn thought causing discussion, examination and even dispute of what was read? 
Chapman obviously gets deeply involved with his writing and poetry. Accept nothing you read, Chapman winks, and challenge everything! It is not only your right but your responsibility! And it is fun, too, especially poetry. Poets rule! 
Additionally, Poetic Justice is an opportunity for Chapman to highlight and dignify his own, unique and vigilant style of writing. A reader may select nearly any poem within, consider its highly energized reasoning, notice the creative, rhythmic rhyming proffered, and then recognize and appreciate Chapmans unique and masterful metering. It is just my own style, Chapman defends. I simply enjoy working with words to write about something special, utilize unique accents of rhyming language and then apply a distinctive, yet rigid, metering format. 
Poetry reflects true thought, Chapman muses. It is honest, forthright, and most importantly, he continues, in a few, brief stanzas, a poem may mesmerize readers, challenge their thoughts and values and force them to reconsider their own points-of-view. What more could a writer want, our author believes. To Dan Chapman, that is the beauty of poetry, and its honesty represents Poetic Justice!" />
