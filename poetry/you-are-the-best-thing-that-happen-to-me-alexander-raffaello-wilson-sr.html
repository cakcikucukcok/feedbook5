  <title>You Are the Best Thing That Happen to Me - Alexander Raffaello Wilson Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="True Love
My book of love poems are poems especially written for adults to enjoy.
When deciding which poem to read, pick the poem that reminded you of that special moment or experience you shared with that special someone in your life.
Take a few minutes to stroll down memory lane, reflect on that image and try to feel that exact feeling you felt back then, I am quite sure you will come real close to it.
The intent of the love poems, are to help you express those wonderful words to the one you care about and love.
Women in general, love words; they experience a totally different emotion than men.
Women take beautiful expressions to heart, and in return they show their appreciation and affection in ways that go beyond.
My love poems are beautiful, they set the tone, they ignite that emotion, they make a person smile, they show affection,   and they help mend that missing gap between couples in love .
They create that special harmony between two persons that care about each other, and they keep you falling in love more and more, and they bring the very best out of you.
Read these poems in your zone of tranquility, while you are relaxing, sipping on a glass of wine, while imagining a candle light dinner just for two.
Share this book with a friend, a partner, with colleagues, and I assure you that true love will come your way.
Enjoy and share one these lovely poems with someone you care for in your own special way.
This book of love poems will definitely change your life. Believe me, it is possible." />
