  <title>Love, Attention, and Affection - James R. Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Love, Attention, and Affection is a three part story elaborating on my trials and tribulations in relationships. It is comprised of three individual stories. But, collectively the three stories combine to tell one ultimate story. Each individual story is represented by a particular color that generalizes the emotions and sentiments of the story. Love is represented by red. Attention correlates to yellow. Affection is strongly associated with purple. With this book I aspire to ignite healthy conversations with people as to what essential functions and components are necessary in order to obtain and maintain a successful relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
My Picture, Your Picture&lt;/br&gt;
My picture says a thousand words&lt;/br&gt;
A story that was never heard&lt;/br&gt; 
Ticklish eyes; vision slightly blurred&lt;/br&gt;
Graceful eyebrows looking incurred&lt;/br&gt; 
Charmed smile and love isnt conserved&lt;/br&gt; 
Gentle lips speaking words misheard&lt;/br&gt; 
Stern posture with love undeterred&lt;/br&gt; 
My picture speaks words overheard&lt;/p&gt; 
Your picture says a thousand words&lt;/br&gt; 
A story that was often heard&lt;/br&gt;
Knavish eyes with feelings reserved&lt;/br&gt; 
Painted eyebrows looking petered&lt;/br&gt; 
Forged smile with emotions deferred&lt;/br&gt;
Vile lips speaking foul words uncured&lt;/br&gt; 
Hunched posture; awareness demurred&lt;/br&gt; 
Your picture is grim and absurd&lt;/p&gt;" />
