  <title>We Honour and Remember Our Brave Soldiers - Sharon Lake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;We Honour and Remember Our Brave Soldiers&lt;/i&gt; offers loving tribute to the brave soldiers who are on the front lines protecting our freedoms. These inspiring poems highlight the pain, the loss, the exercises, and the daily challenges that the soldiers face in their support of America and Canada. They also focus on the love and support that each soldier depends upon from their families and friends back home. Behind every soldier is a strong support system, waiting and praying for their safe return!
This poetry collection is meant to be a window into the lives of the soldiers who risk their lives every day to insure our well-being, as well as an indication of gratitude from the heart. 
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Behind Every Soldier&lt;/b&gt;
Behind every Soldier,
Stands a proud family.
A family who believes in,
Their son, daughter, husband,
Wife, niece, or nephew, anyone.
Who wants to be a Soldier?
They stand and believe,
In their dreams.
They help make it run smoothly,
With being understanding.
There, there to cheer you up,
When youre down.
They believe in you every step,
Of the way.
They believe you will make
A great soldier.
Every step of the way,
As long as you have a proud, loving family,
Who believes in you,
And you believe in yourself.&lt;/i&gt;" />
