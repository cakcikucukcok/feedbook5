  <title>Serendipity - Sangi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;These poems are a very personal collection. They represent the last fifteen years of my deeper subconscious thoughts and emotions. I faced the common teenage heartbreak, but it was not until later in my life that I really knew what true heartbreak was. Ironically, I did not write during these times. Some poems in this collection are directly related to specific true events, however so many of them I look at and wonderwas it really me who wrote them? They take me by surprise even now. The content is almost cryptic to even those closest to me. My deepest, strongest feelings have been brought out in this collection. The poems are dated by year to create a story of the paths my emotional life took.&lt;/p&gt;" />
