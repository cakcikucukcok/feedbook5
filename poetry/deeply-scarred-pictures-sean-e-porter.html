  <title>Deeply Scarred Pictures - Sean E. Porter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the second book of the poetry series, Deeply Scarred Pictures, Painful Sorrow. These poems reflect my life, in small moments at a time. They express my life, or the life of others around me that has no voice, but their stories needed to be told. My poems represent the struggles in my life, my fight through an abusive childhood, my troubled youth, being brought up in a home of poverty and violence. They represent my battle through prison, fighting for my freedom. These books represent my broken heart, and my battle with depression. These books tell the stories of broken relationships Ive had, and the endless pain that thrives from them. Lost love, along with the sadness of my experiences in life. My books, tell my story about homelessness, by battle with cancer, my close and sad relationship with alzheimers and dementia, and my battle with heart disease. These books tell my story, and in hopes that other will know that theyre not alone in their pain. The words deeply scarred pictures, they are my way of describing painful memories that stick with you, they are fragments and pictures of pain that all tell a story. My poems are those pictures from within me. I always told people that there was a purpose for all the pain Ive experienced in my life, that my pain would be my success. When I express myself in poetry, my pain flows out of me threw the tip of my pen, on to the paper, and it releases pressure, and I feel so much better. My gift to the world is my poems. I dont want anybody to ever feel as if they are alone, the fact is that, I share their pain." />
