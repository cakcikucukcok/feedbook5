  <title>The Memphis Nightclub Murders &amp; Other Poetic Mysteries - D. C. Quillan Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Memphis Nightclub Murders &amp; Other Poetic Mysteries is a collection of short stories in poetic form remotely based on legends, folklore, history, and serial crimes, elaborated and expanded into uniquely fictitious accounts. The collection features a trilogy of murder mysteries set in Memphis, Tennessee, of late 1950s.
Rhymes on Rye No. 132
As bawdy the crass sax, or perhaps paramours brass sex
Words form then stack, betwixt thighs impasse vexed
He her rex and she his text, the poets verse un-tersely
Pretzeling below the canopys white lace so transversely
Whiskey arouses souls, like bloody tattoos incite flesh
By ills in thrills enmeshed, as chaff-n-wheat pre-threshed
So are facts killed, else skewed, by inebriations effects
Too wrecked to judge, to deflect nudges then neglects
Silk lilts then saunters, off back, over left shoulder
Batoned by airy symphony, while moods wax bolder
Crooning from gulf to bluffs, along hips neath slip
Lips to flesh, sips of sweat, enmeshing in odic scripts" />
