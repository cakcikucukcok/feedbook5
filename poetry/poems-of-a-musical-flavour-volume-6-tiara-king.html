  <title>Poems Of A Musical Flavour: Volume 6 - Tiara King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is the last in the series and covers years 1994 to 1996 and 2002.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was 20, 21 and 22 and my life was a little more&amp;hellip;meh&amp;hellip;and so much happened I guess I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to write, but I certainly had the ideas. I was legally an adult, technically an adult, but mentally still a teenager. With everything going on in my life I wrote less and less. Clearly the endeavour was waning. Or I just needed a holiday. I did start line dancing and that grew into a full blown love for three years. It was music, after all&amp;hellip;so clearly my love of music was now leaning toward the dancing side of things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 2002 I wrote 1 song. That&amp;rsquo;s all I wrote. And I&amp;rsquo;m surprised I wrote that because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t written in six years. I was 28, still living at home as I had taken on the chore of being a care-giver for my mother and I had moved into other things. Line dancing had stopped but my love of music hadn&amp;rsquo;t and never will.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was the last song I wrote and all of them were my practice for storytelling in four verses, a chorus, and a bridge for much bigger and better things. And now I&amp;rsquo;ve honoured them with these publications.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book also contains some witty one liners and anecdotes about what was happening, who I wanted to be, or who I had a crush on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They are not perfect, nor meant to be, they&amp;rsquo;re just the musings of a young woman with crushes and dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
