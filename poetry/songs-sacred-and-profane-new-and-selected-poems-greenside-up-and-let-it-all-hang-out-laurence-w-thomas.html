  <title>Songs Sacred and Profane - New and Selected Poems:  Greenside up and Let It All Hang Out - Laurence W. Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Songs Sacred and Profane is a selection from Thomas&#39; four other books and eight chapbooks plus many poems that have not appeared in book form.  This volume contains, in fact, two quite different books published as one.  &quot;Greenside Up&quot;, written almost entirely looking into his garden, is made up of bucolic works which observe nature and a quiet life.  They are well mannered, introspective, and show the poet&#39;s sensitivity to language and his world.  &quot;Let It All Hang Out&quot; lets loose with poems that show Thomas&#39; acerbic wit at times, his wry approach to human foibles, and his personal take on religion coupled with various aspects of love, mutability, and mortality." />
