  <title>The Doctor in the Night - Martin C. Rosner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;If you enjoy poetry that is thoughtful, respectful of the craft, and deeply moving, then you do not want to miss owning this book.  Dr. Rosner embraces all that is in the &#39;here and now&#39;, and expresses it with grace, rhythm, passion and power.  It is difficult to relate his works to other contemporaries because of his unique approach to the gift of life, love and his immense grasp of the English language.  For those who feel the pulse of life, the way in which Dr. Rosner expresses his selected subject matter can easily bring one to tears.  His works should be digested slowly, one poem at a time, savoring each word, allowing the reader to discover his or her heart written within the pages.  I eagerly await the release of &#39;The Doctor in the Night&#39;, knowing that we will all share and celebrate this moment in time with a living poet that possesses the magic to touch the soul.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
