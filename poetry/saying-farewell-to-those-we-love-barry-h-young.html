  <title>Saying Farewell to Those We Love - Barry H Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is dedicated to all practising and aspiring celebrants who have been entrusted with the gift of responsibility and professional duty of composing and conducting each beautiful and meaningful funeral service. It is a privilege and honour to wear the title of Funeral Celebrant. The main purpose of this book is to provide practising and aspiring celebrants a selection of poems, prose and phrases to assist with every manner of a loved one&#39;s passing. There are passages for the elderly, middle-aged, teenagers, babies, tragic occurrences, suicides and lonely; those who cut themselves off from society; those without family and those affected by illnesses and drugs. It provides tributes from husbands and wives, tributes from sons and daughters, grandchildren and those who served in the forces, together with religious readings and prayers. It is not a working reference manual similar to the &#39;Funeral Celebrants Handbook&#39;; however, it complements it with a myriad of appropriate alternative passages that challenge funeral celebrants to be proactive in providing a choice of enhanced funeral rites. How often does a celebrant use the same tired dialogue avoiding words that might sound flowery or archaic, yet whose meaning, depth of understanding, empathy and beauty, bring solace, comfort and sense of closure to the bereaved? No doubt when preparing and conducting a service, celebrants all have their own styles, creativity and sensitivity in the final presentation. This book of passages is not meant to change one&#39;s own unique technique, but to offer an abundance of alternative or inspirational choices. Being mindful of order and clarity the author has endeavoured to keep this large selection of poems, prose and readings uncluttered. Accordingly he has placed appropriate passages under specific headings. The headings are in similar order and sequence to &#39;The Funeral Celebrants Handbook&#39; commencing with the Introduction and culminating with the Committal and Benediction." />
