  <title>Stroke of Country - Doris Autry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The title of my book, Stroke of Country, is something I have dreamed about for years. I have been drawing and writing all my life. I first started painting professionally while working in sewing factories. The extra income helped in raising my family of three lovely daughters, Lakricia, Vicky, and Daisy.
I was to have a hysterectomy. Through prayers, I was healed, and about fifteen years later, I gave birth to a son. I named him Jonathan, which means &quot;a gift from God.&quot;
When Jonathan was eight, I applied for a divorce and the sewing factory was sent overseas about the same time. 
I attended college for the next four years and earned my BA in business. During this time I was still writing poetry and painting. It has always been a source of joy for me." />
