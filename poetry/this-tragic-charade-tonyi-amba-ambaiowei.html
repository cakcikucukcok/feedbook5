  <title>This Tragic Charade - Tonyi Amba-Ambaiowei</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Inspired by current realities in Nigeria, &lt;em&gt;This Tragic Charade&lt;/em&gt; lends a voice to sensitive Nigerian issues like corruption and patriotism with strong sentiments. Poet Tonyi Amba-Ambaiowei was born and raised in Nigeria, so he has had plenty of time to observe its beauties and its horrors, which he now eloquently shares via imagery and verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His poems recapture intriguing traditional Ijaw folklore as well as contemporary experiences, illustrated by a selection of art that showcases the truly rich cultural heritage of Africas most populous black nation. The artists featured are masters of their craft, and their works display a variety of contemporary themes with strong visual expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonyi is driven by his social conscience and passion for traditional values. He writes to his beloved fatherland, in dire need of patriotic revolution. He writes also to feel better, in memory of the numerous times his hopes were dashed and adversities seemed to reign. Where emotional power meets sensory impact and art meets the written word, &lt;em&gt;This Tragic Charade&lt;/em&gt; illuminates a different culture and its customs, in need of remembrance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
