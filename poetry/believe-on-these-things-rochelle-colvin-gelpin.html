  <title>Believe on These Things - Rochelle Colvin Gelpin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Believe on These Things is a book of inspirational poetry that
inspires comfort in brokeness, healing for pain, and courage where
there is fear. The poems in this book are a reminder of how God will
strengthen and comfort when we are discouraged or overwhelmed.
Like Have Faith In God, it will assure those who are going through
trying times to not be moved by what is seen, heard, or even felt. It&#39;s
a reminder that God is bigger than any storm.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;Center&gt;In the midst of all you&#39;re going through&lt;br&gt;
God is making a way for you.&lt;br&gt;
Stand still because it won&#39;t be long&lt;br&gt;
Before all the hurt you feel is gone.&lt;br&gt;
In spite of everything you feel&lt;br&gt;
Have faith in God and just stand still.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
Don&#39;t be persuaded by your mountain, have faith in God. Whenever
you feel a need for encouragement, remember: what so ever things
are lovely, pure, and honest, whatever things are of a good report,
Believe On These Things." />
