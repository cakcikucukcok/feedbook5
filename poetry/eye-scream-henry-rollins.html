  <title>Eye Scream - Henry Rollins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&quot;Work on Eye Scream started in 1986. I was crossing America constantly and&lt;BR&gt;experiencing the morality shifts, attitudes, and rituals in different parts&lt;BR&gt;of the country - the difference in the way people were in the Bible Belt as&lt;BR&gt;opposed to New York City, the way blacks and whites interfaced, the&lt;BR&gt;intolerance of homosexuality, the morality plays. I started to become aware&lt;BR&gt;of how brutal the country is and how much ferocity, cruelty, and oppression&lt;BR&gt;are inherent in the culture and how much of it was in me. I wanted to&lt;BR&gt;document it and create a book that brought the whole thing to a boil and see w&lt;BR&gt;here it left me off. In the summer of 1995, I finished the book and started&lt;BR&gt;to edit. Re-reading the manuscript over and over, I realized all the things I&lt;BR&gt;had picked up over a decade of playing Devil&#39;s advocate and it was inspiring&lt;BR&gt;because it clearly defined who my enemies are. As an American, I feel it&lt;BR&gt;impossible not to be infuriated by the way things are and have been. I refuse&lt;BR&gt;to be happy about the day-to-day and go along with it. There&#39;s too much&lt;BR&gt;spitting in my face and too much spitting in the faces of people who don&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;know any other way of life. This book is brutal, and at times, funny. I know&lt;BR&gt;that I will probably get a ton of shit for Eye Scream. Enjoy, or better&lt;BR&gt;yet... don&#39;t.&quot; ---- Henry Rollins&lt;/div&gt;" />
