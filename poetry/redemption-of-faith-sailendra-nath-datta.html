  <title>Redemption of Faith - Sailendra Nath Datta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here is a book of 88 poems, written in about last eight months by the poet on various themes. These include his varied feelings, ideas, moods, realization and so on.  Again, some of the poems read like a series of soliloquy of his mind. The topics are spread over arenas like economic, social, cultural, and emotional spheres. Issues from the national and international fields sometimes haunt him though, he rather consciously avoid speaking on political agenda. His political belief is rather unpronounced in his poems, although he has definitely some areas of conviction.  His religious feelings denote that he has a pantheistic turn of mind and his humanistic faith is sometimes forcefully expressed. Certain poems show a similarity with Tagores belief in the God of Life.  The form as well as language of the poems is quite simple; their contents are expressed in a matter-of-fact way, with little scope of ambiguity.  It seems the poet does not believe much in experimentation. Like his first book from the Partridge, it is expected that this present volume will also be critically appreciated by the readers of poetry in the international literary arena." />
