  <title>In the Chronicles of an Immigrant Mother - Jane Mbaratha-Rurigi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This poem book is a collection of experiences for a lady in diaspora. After moving from Africa to the United States, she was faced with the hard reality of what it means to move to another country. Trying to settle down in a foreign land, striving to make a living the only way she can, to sustain a family and raise teenage children. This turned out to be one of the greatest challenges of life. The poems were written to express self, to answer questions that raced in her mind, wondering whether it was worth the sacrifice, as she worked tirelessly to make ends meet. When you are faced with lifes obstacles, remember it could be the detour you need to turn your focus toward your destiny." />
