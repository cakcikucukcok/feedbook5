  <title>Hoo - Lee Moradi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A unique picture of the Universe is proposed by astrophysics that&#39;s quite interesting. This picture is derived from combining quantum mechanics with Einstein&#39;s General Relativity, and provides a new possibility. In this picture, space and time together form a finite four-dimensional space without singularities or boundaries, much like the surface of earth but with more dimensions. This picture states that the universe has always been and will continue to be. That there was never a beginning, and there will never be an end. In other words, &quot;if the universe is really completely self-contained and not affected by anything outside itself, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning (created) nor end (destroyed), it would simply BE.&quot; In such a picture, the universe expands from a small mass only to some day contract back. The length of time for these events is far greater than man can ever hope to measure.  In its current mode, the universe is in a state of expansion. This expansion creates the space between what we call objects, and the time sensation we feel in our daily routines. So come with me today to a world you may have never considered, and I assure you that you will never look at life the same way again. A world where all is one and one is all; a world where unity is the essence of diversity and diversity is the manifestation of unity.&lt;/P&gt;" />

    	<p>A unique picture of the Universe is proposed by astrophysics that's quite interesting. This picture is derived from combining quantum mechanics with Einstein's General Relativity, and provides a new possibility.

In other words, "if the universe is really completely self-contained and not affected by anything outside itself, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning (created) nor end (destroyed), it would simply BE."
