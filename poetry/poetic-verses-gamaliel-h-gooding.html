  <title>Poetic Verses - Gamaliel H. Gooding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have attempted to include poems that are easily understood, readily associated with one&#39;s daily life and circumstances. Because of it&#39;s diversity, hopefully this book will be appealing to everyone. I have also attempted to share my own life&#39;s experiences, good, bad and indifferent, in a way that is clear and tasteful to the reader. Mostly all of my work deals with reality, my personal concept of how things are, the way I think things should be, and ultimately, the way I think things should turn out. I am fortunate enough to have had parents that were not only christians but ministers. Because of my religious backgroud and upbringing, my insights are critical when engaged in relationships of husband and wife, family, and friends and associates. I hope when you read my work, you will enjoy it as much as I did creating it. Maybe in some small way, you too may be inspired to reach out to someone, if you haven&#39;t already. My philosophy is there is no better medicine for the soul then caring." />
