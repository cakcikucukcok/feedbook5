  <title>Spiritual Visions - Cathy Jewell Dalpra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Spiritual Visions,&lt;/i&gt; author Cathy Jewell Dalpra considers how God is part of everything in lifehow we can visualize the spirituality of life through Him. Whether it is the turning of darkness into light, the opening of the heavens, or the sweet songs of the birds, His presence is felt everywhere, in all things. The poetry in this collection looks at the inspiration that can change the lives of many or brighten the day of a few. Her poetry explores the important things that matter in life, our loved ones who support us, the ability to write poignant poetry that offers visions of hope and love, and the peace that can be found in the serenity of our relationship with God and nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the poetry in &lt;i&gt;Spiritual Visions,&lt;/i&gt; we experience spirituality in many ways, from the quietness of dawn, when the presence of God surrounds us, to the joy of friendship. The beauty of these precious moments inspires us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dawn Break&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;May 1, 2011, from God&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I hear the morning birds chirping.
My cats and I are peacefully listening.
We have been up for hours, dawn breaking.
Our other cat friends have come, are napping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The six cats and I have a 4:00 a.m. meeting.
They eat and play as I am spiritually centering.
The unconditional love they generate is disbelieving.
Poems and scriptures from God start flowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;" />
