  <title>The Invisible Arm: Poems at 97 - Jess Strauss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his sixth book, ninety-seven year old poet Jess Strauss shares his own experiences, ideas, and reflections on overcoming the challenges that life presents over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communicating the importance of love, caring, and friendship, he encourages us to be active and not rest on the sidelines.  Each of us should be a friend to ensure an &quot;Invisible Arm&quot; around another&#39;s shoulder for support in hard times when we aren&#39;t available.  The poems are real, sincere, and thought provoking.  Strauss&#39;s reference to the many degrees of love, from young to old, family to valued friends, developing new friends or dealing with the loss of loved ones, will cause you to ponder.  You will feel his compassion for the poor, his attitude toward war, and concern for nature and the environment.  It will stimulate your own buried thoughts on many subjects.  How many obstacles did you overcome?  It&#39;s all in The Invisible Arm: Poems at 97.&lt;/p&gt;" />
