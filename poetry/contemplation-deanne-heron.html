  <title>Contemplation - Deanne Heron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Contemplation is a collection of thoughts and emotions expressed in poetry; therapeutic REFLECTIONS. The poems in this collection express many moods from sadness and heartache to mischievous musings and all the moods in between. Contemplation expresses an emotional journey from stressed confusion to inner peace. It is an art form of carefully crafted words; a sculpture of soothing words like honey to heal. Deanne Heron was born in Jamaica but came to live in England in 1967. She is a qualified counsellor/trainer and foster carer. She has published two volumes of short humorous stories, written in standard English with Jamaican patois dialogue, called Pardner Money Stories. Deanne reads her stories on local radio as well as presenting news and Black History Month programmes. Deanne also has a personal interest in Black History and as such has delivered presentations to schools and heads of education establishments on the need for black history to be taught to young people. Deanne&#39;s primary school teacher&#39;s love of poetry sparked her own interest in poetry and writing in general. She has found writing poetry an escape and a very therapeutic way to cope with racism and the harsh life she experienced in Britain on her arrival." />
