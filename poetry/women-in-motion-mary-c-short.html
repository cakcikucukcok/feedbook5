  <title>Women in Motion - Mary C. Short</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What started out as rhymes by a child has been turned into music by a woman. When I was a teenager, I did lots of rhymes, then I started writing poems and welcomes to help out for special events and occasions. My son told me that I could make money doing that, so I prayed about that and things started happening.
Mary spends most of her day at Bank One as an executive food service worker. She is the mother of seven children, who range in age from 26 to 45, and has 16 grandchildren. One of her loves is basketball which she became attached to as part of the Greenbrier High School Girls Championship team. She still enjoys an occasional game with her children. Mary has been a member of St. Elizabeth Church in Louisville for 31 years. During her membership, she has been an adult Sunday school teacher, president of the usher board, and booking clerk.
Although Mary has a way with words, she also has a way with caring. She is always on the lookout for those less fortunate. She helps people with disabilities that keep them from taking care of themselves. When you are doing things for others, you often do things that you wouldnt do for yourself.
In 1997, Mary was promoted to commercial loan support specialist. On July 1, 2000, she remarried, and her last name became Short.
this is my second spiritual inspirational book to be published." />
