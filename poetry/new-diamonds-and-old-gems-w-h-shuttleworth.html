  <title>New Diamonds and Old Gems - W.H. Shuttleworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Weve all heard, Diamonds are Forever! But is it really true? If diamonds could talk, Im sure they would tell many stories of intrigue, lust, and greed, but also about a few beautiful love stories where fairy tale couples marry and live happily ever after.
	On a tour of the Holyland, two decades ago, our group ventured into a somewhat exclusive diamond factory. We watched a meticulous diamond cutter at work at his bench. Although many enticing gems and decorative items of jewelry were on display, I shyly slipped away without even the tiniest free sample. However, very shortly thereafter, I grabbed up a beautiful gemstone necklace from a persistent Arab street vendor in the city of our Saviors birth. It later glistened like the Star of Bethlehem whenever my mom wore it.
	Besides this, I noticed how a member of our tour group was picking up a worthless little stone at every holy site we would visit. Very soon I was following her example. What is the value of such a collection of stones? Only the memories it brings back to our minds every time we gaze upon it.
	Hopefully, my bag of stones (or poems) will be of similar value to the reader if this book. But please dont altogether elude The Sacred Vault and The Cavern of Commentaries. At any rate, may you pursuer and enjoy the adventure of it all." />
