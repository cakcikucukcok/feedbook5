  <title>Signatures Upon Cantata - Smithson Buchi Ahiabuike</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This anthology of political poems lends a voice of patriotism to political protests as a free born of Africa. These poems have been written in protests to the evils of corruption in the continent of Africa and most other third-world countries. In the process, the author has lent his voice with the protests for good governance in Africa. In the same vein, he has many laments on the lack of patriotism in Africa and how much that has set the continent back, compared to the Asian tigers that started in the same footing with Africa. It is true that Africa was the last frontiers of conquests by the colonial explorers and pirates, but there is nothing hard about learning from others who have been there to not make the same mistakes that characterized most nation builders. It is true that one of the banes of African politics is her numerous ethnic groups and the need to satisfy everyone, but we cannot fail to acknowledge that the world is changing pretty fast and that we need to adapt to those changes, so as not to be left in the dark." />
