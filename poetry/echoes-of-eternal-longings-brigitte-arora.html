  <title>Echoes of Eternal Longings - Brigitte Arora</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you only knew that the endless ache within is your unknown longing for methough you know it not and go seeking outward for My substitute. You wander far and wide searching for the source of My siren call. You need but ask and I your most beloved shall come to lead you back to Me. 
Poetry is the natural form in which an overflowing Heart expresses itself, whether it is love for another human being or to express the longing for Divine contact with a higher power. Poetry that comes from the Flow of Divine Inspiration is one of the ways that the Soul communicates its presence to those who are yearning to unite with their Higher Self--their Soul.
Man has always searched for something that is higher than him self. He has always looked outward for an entity that he could worship as a goda power that would protect and help him whenever he was in need. As mankind evolved spiritually, some began to hear a silent call coming from within, deep-seated echoes of unexplainable calls of yearning that would unexpectedly surge up within, giving rise to restlessness and unexplainable longings. 
Throughout mankinds history there were always a few who came to understand that these calls were intimations from the Soul prompting Man to go in search of himself. And through his seeking, find the reason for his journeys into time and duality and the immortal roots of his Beingness." />
