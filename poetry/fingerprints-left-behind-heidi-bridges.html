  <title>Fingerprints Left Behind - Heidi Bridges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every one of us has a story to tell (a testimony) and a reason to praise God. You did not get this far in life on your own merit. You got this far by Gods Grace and Mercy. You got this far because God gave you what you did not deserve.
Take a moment and look back at all the things in life you have done, (whether you got caught or not is not the importance), think about everything you have done, look at yourself in the mirror and be honest with yourself, then you will be able to see that you were given favor by God, and He did not give you what you deserved.
If you still question whether God is real, look into the eyes of your children, your sisters, your brothers, your husband, your wife, breathe in and breathe out, if you woke up on this side of the dirt today, thats how you can know that God is real, you cannot sustain yourself, God sustains you.
If you have read the poems in this book and you were affected by them, if they touched your heart and you dont know Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, I encourage you to come into a relationship with him. Make God the Lord of your life, and watch things happen in your life that you cannot explain. . . . . . . . thats GOD!!!!!!!!" />
