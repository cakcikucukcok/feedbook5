  <title>The Deleted World - Tomas Transtromer, Robin Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A short selection of haunting, meditative poems from the winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Literature&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomas Tranströmer can be clearly recognized not just as Sweden&#39;s most important poet, but as a writer of international stature whose work speaks to us now with undiminished clarity and resonance. Long celebrated as a master of the arresting, suggestive image, Tranströmer is a poet of the liminal: drawn again and again to thresholds of light and of water, the boundaries between man and nature, wakefulness and dream. A deeply spiritual but secular writer, his skepticism about humanity is continually challenged by the implacable renewing power of the natural world. His poems are epiphanies rooted in experience: spare, luminous meditations that his extraordinary images split open--exposing something sudden, mysterious, and unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
