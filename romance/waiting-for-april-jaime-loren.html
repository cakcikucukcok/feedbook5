  <title>Waiting for April - Jaime Loren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April Fletcher has died nineteen times... but she doesn&amp;#39;t know it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As far as April is concerned, she&amp;#39;s just a normal seventeen-year-old, looking forward to spending spring break with her friends and going to college in the fall. April doesn&amp;#39;t know she has never lived past her eighteenth birthday, nor does she realize that Scott Parker, her best friend, is actually her childhood sweetheart and fianc&amp;eacute; from her very first life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For nineteen-year-old Scott Parker, spending quality time with his soul mate has proved difficult ever since her tragic death in 1729. Since then he has lost her an additional eighteen times&amp;mdash;each of her deaths more devastating than the last, and each of her births wiping the slate of her memory clean. Unable to save her but unwilling to give up, Scott has to hide the fact he&amp;#39;s immortal&amp;mdash;and will be until April confesses her love again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But this time, things have changed. April has denied her feelings for him, is dating someone else, and with her eighteenth birthday fast approaching, their friendship is falling to pieces. Fearing their souls are irrevocably drifting apart, Scott must race against the clock to win her heart and save her life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Or risk losing her forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
