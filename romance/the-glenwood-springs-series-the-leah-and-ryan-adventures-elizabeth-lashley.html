  <title>The Glenwood Springs Series          the Leah and Ryan Adventures - Elizabeth Lashley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Leah is a single female who headed west to become a pioneer. She encounters a lot more than she ever could have imagine. She falls for a rustic mountain man that takes her on wild adventures. She stands against renegades, the army, gunslingers, robbers, and more. The town never knew a city girl could save their town. This is only the first book of many to come in this series. It&#39;s full of lies, murders, mysteries with a twist that will leave you wanting more and so much more. My books will always have the same people, setting, and all. The  whole town knows secrets about Leah and her devoted mountain man that you could never imagine. Even their own parents are in on the mysterious life they have among the Cheyenne Indians and the president of the United States. The trust is always an issue from the shy school teacher to the owner of the saloon." />
