  <title>Grant Me a Cloud - Helena R. Carvalho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kayleigh Reis is single, owns a small Antique Shoppe, and is living the good life in Southern California. That was about to change.&lt;/P&gt;
On her way to her Antique Shoppe, some maniacal driver runs her off the road. She flags down a passing motorist in a strange car. Once inside the car, she feels herself getting sleepy. She can&#39;t keep her eyes open any longer.&lt;/P&gt;
In a place she never thought possible, she meets the perfect man. He is gorgeous, and has the most spectacular ice blue colored eyes. A beautiful woman appears on a cloud and takes her prisoner.&lt;/P&gt;
Kayleigh awakes in her bed. Was it a dream? Did it really happen? If it did happen, will she ever see him again? Who was that woman?&lt;/P&gt;
She&#39;s being threatened, but doesn&#39;t know by who or why. She feels like she&#39;s being watched but can never catch anybody looking at her. Is she in some sort of weird love triangle that she doesn&#39;t know about?&lt;/P&gt;
Her life is becoming exciting, adventurous, and dangerous all at the same time. Will she be able to handle all of this on her own? Will her best friend, Beth, be able to help her?&lt;/P&gt;" />
