          &lt;strong&gt;This time the groom?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hometown Golden Girl Emily Whitaker couldn&#39;t have left Crimson in her rear view mirror fast enough…until life threw her some curveballs and she&#39;s back –divorced and with a young son. Her brother’s wedding should have been a welcome reprieve, but Jase Crenshaw is the best man to her maid of honor. She’d steered clear of him when they were kids, but now Jase has become one highly irresistible man.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jase always harbored a crush on his best friend’s sister. Back then, she was too good for the kid from the wrong side of the tracks. Now she thinks the upstanding town lawyer and mayoral candidate is too good for her. Can Jase convince the girl of his dreams they&#39;re they&#39;re both actually perfect…for each other?&lt;/p&gt;
