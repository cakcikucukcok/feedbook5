  <title>Crossed Lines - Jessica Cross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For so many years, Sandra had worked and strived toward her ideal of the perfect life. By most people&amp;rsquo;s standards, she had it all &amp;ndash; the handsome, upwardly-mobile husband; a respected career at the university; and a nice home, that was ready to receive a child or two under its roof. Like so many of us, Sandra had a vision of the ideal future she&amp;rsquo;d wanted to create. She thought she knew where life would take her and how things would unfold. But Sandra&amp;rsquo;s perfect life in suburbia began to show some cracks; and in her weakest moment, she relaxed her morals and grabbed the passion her life had been missing. Like a starving woman, her mouth watered for the fine chocolate that was offered her and she couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist temptation. Yet one bite of chocolate is never enough &amp;ndash; especially for a woman who&amp;rsquo;s been hungering for sweet satisfaction for too long. Just like a dieter regrets giving in to temptation, so did Sandra; and like a weak dieter, she went back for more of the heavenly goodness that fed her ravenous appetite. She couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the taste out of her mind and she went back for more &amp;ndash; again and again. As she fed her awakened appetite, her perfect world spun out of control. Secrets and passions would collide for a cataclysmic undoing of not only Sandra&amp;rsquo;s world, but the lives of many others too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
