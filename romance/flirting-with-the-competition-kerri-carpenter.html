  <title>Flirting With The Competition - Kerri Carpenter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, Whitney March might have appreciated sharing an elevator with a ridiculously attractive and clearly wealthy guy. Even &lt;i&gt;enjoyed&lt;/i&gt; it. But when her companion turns out to be the man who almost ran her over in parking garage moments earlier? Nope and nope. Besides, she&#39;s on her way to a job interview at a prestigious law firm, and she needs to stay focused. Not staring at the rich and sexy jerk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the elevator comes to an abrupt stop. They&#39;re &lt;i&gt;stuck&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan Campbell has every intention of acing the interview for his dream job, and he&#39;s not about to let anything stop him. Not even the sexy, capable, and fiery woman who turns out to be his main competitor he&#39;s trapped with. The only thing they have in common is determination to get the job...and an escalating attraction. And it&#39;s only a matter of time before these competitors indulge in a very sexy little connection between floors.&lt;/p&gt;" />
