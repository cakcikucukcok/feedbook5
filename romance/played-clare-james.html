Or be played.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The music should be enough. End of story. But Aaron Major is finding out it&#39;s not, and now his agent has hired a firm of suits to help launch his debut album, turning his life into a goddamn circus. Smile here. Play there. Be nice. Well, screw that. If Aaron wanted to spend his time shaking hands and kissing babies, he would&#39;ve gone into politics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helping launch the career of country singer Aaron Major should be a cakewalk for PR pro Melody Sharp. Aaron is charming, sexy, and oh-so-appealing when he&#39;s on stage. Off stage, though, he&#39;s her worst nightmare. A stubborn, ornery, reclusive nightmare without a lick of business-or fashion-sense. The only way he&#39;s going to make it in music is with a serious makeover-and quite possibly a personality transplant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon, they&#39;re engaged in a game of give and take, and though it&#39;s Melody calling the shots, it&#39;s Aaron who holds all control...&lt;/p&gt;" />
