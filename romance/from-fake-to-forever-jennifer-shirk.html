  <title>From Fake to Forever - Jennifer Shirk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sandra Moyer&#39;s preschool is struggling, so when her sister suggests allowing a super-famous actor to research his latest role there, she reluctantly agrees. Except the actor turns out to be Ben Capshaw--a playboy who&#39;s never serious, always joking around, and who knows zero about kids or being a parent. Case in point: his involvement in the untimely death of the preschool&#39;s class pet...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ben is enjoying teaching more than he thought he would, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s looking for a permanent position. Sure, he&#39;s ready for more serious movie roles and less goofing off, but the buttoned-up, beautiful Sandra and her young daughter are more than he bargained for. Plus, Sandra still won&#39;t trust him--what if it&#39;s all an act, research for the role? As the lines between make-believe and reality blur, Ben will have to decide if love is worth casting aside the role of his life for a new role...that could last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;" />
