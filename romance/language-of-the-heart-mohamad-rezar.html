  <title>Language of the Heart - Mohamad Rezar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear Reader:&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Inside the covers of &lt;I&gt;Language of the Heart&lt;/I&gt; you will read letters written from Jonathan to his Sweetheart, Princess Mahsa Elaine Tabori. But &lt;I&gt;why&lt;/I&gt;, what caused Mohamad to assemble a book of nothing but letters?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Why would a book of letters, all written from one person to another, be listed and sold as a romance novel?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Because &quot;Romance&quot; is a story, an adventure between two hearts that become one through friendship and Love.
	&lt;I&gt;Language of the Heart &lt;/I&gt;could be labeled as a diary or a journal, but each letter is a token of love; a gift from Jonathan&#39;s heart, unveiling himself and his love, romancing the one that his heart loves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
	By reading the letters, you will come to know of the bonding of friendship and love that Jonathan felt for Princess Mahsa. You will come to know Jonathan as Princess Mahsa came to know him, and see the heart of Princess Mahsa as Jonathan knew her heart. See the romance unfold that caused their hearts to become as one. Two hearts in communication, speaking as one." />
