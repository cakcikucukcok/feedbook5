  <title>Thyme Travelers - Thomas Neale King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A surprise inheritance. A derelict mansion. His own time portal. Then, poof&amp;mdash;All gone &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1985, Jack Thyme is a young teacher at an exclusive prep school in Portland, Oregon. When his aunt dies suddenly, the terms of his grandfather&amp;rsquo;s trust kick in. In less than 48 hours he is in a small Virginia town he didn&amp;rsquo;t know existed, meeting with a bunch of lawyers about an inheritance from a man he never knew. What the lawyers don&amp;rsquo;t tell him&amp;mdash;probably don&amp;rsquo;t know themselves&amp;mdash;Jack has also inherited his family&amp;rsquo;s legacy as time travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack&amp;rsquo;s inheritance includes Traveler&amp;rsquo;s Rest, a decaying mansion where all the rooms are empty except the ballroom, which is a hoarder&amp;#39;s delight overflowing with boxes, knickknacks and furniture of every type and era. On his first night in the house, Jack wakes to the sound of a clock randomly striking twelve even though the actual clock hasn&amp;rsquo;t been in the house for years. With each chime of the clock, he momentarily moves between the house&amp;rsquo;s past and present. After that, packages start to arrive delivered by leather-wearing, motorcycle-riding couriers who can find Jack no matter where he is. Are these packages containing an antique key, a gold cross with a cryptic Latin inscription and a monk&amp;rsquo;s robe an invitation to adventure? Or, someone&amp;rsquo;s idea of a joke?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jack&amp;rsquo;s journey is just beginning in &lt;em&gt;Thyme Travelers&lt;/em&gt;, the first book in the Thyme Travelers Chronicles series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
