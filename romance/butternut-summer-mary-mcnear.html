  <title>Butternut Summer - Mary McNear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every summer on Butternut Lake the tourists arrive, the shops open, and the waves lap its tree-lined shores, just as they have for years. But this season everything changes for one mother and daughter who&amp;#39;ve always called the lake home. . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caroline&amp;#39;s life is turned upside down the moment her ex-husband, Jack, strides through the door of her coffee shop. He seems changed&amp;#8212;stronger, steadier, and determined to make amends with Caroline and their daughter, Daisy. Is he really different, or is he the same irresistibly charming but irresponsible man he was when he left Butternut Lake eighteen years ago? Caroline, whose life is stuck on pause as her finances are going down the tubes, is tempted to let him back into her life . . . but would it be wise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Caroline&amp;#39;s daughter, Daisy, the summer is filled with surprises. Home from college, she&amp;#39;s reunited with the father she adores&amp;#8212;but hardly knows&amp;#8212;and swept away by her first true love. But Will isn&amp;#39;t what her mother wants for her&amp;#8212;all Caroline can see is that he&amp;#39;s the kind of sexy &amp;#34;bad boy&amp;#34; Daisy should stay away from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the long, lazy days of summer pass, Daisy and Caroline come to realize that even if Butternut Lake doesn&amp;#39;t change, life does. . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
