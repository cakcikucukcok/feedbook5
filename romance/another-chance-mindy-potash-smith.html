  <title>Another Chance - Mindy Potash-Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Justin Nichols had it all and hits rock-bottom when its stripped from him. But when he lays eyes on his high-school sweetheart a fire lights inside him and makes him realize theres something left in life worth fighting for.
Kristen Delanie had her heart broken at age sixteen and finds herself face to face with the man responsible. He not only made her self-conscious but also left her feeling inferior. She knows in her heart the only way to get rid of her insecurities is to let him back into her life, but at what cost?
Almost immediately, someone is trying to send Kristen a message by turning her world upside down. Is the strangers focus on her, or is it coincidental that it didnt start happening until Justin waltzed back into her life?
The whole situation leaves them both wondering, is it possible to get another chance?" />
