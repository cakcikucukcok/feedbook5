        &lt;p&gt;When waitress Rachel McKaslin reluctantly let Jake McCall move into the apartment above her family&#39;s diner, she never dreamed the handsome tech sergeant would be so charming. Soon into their joyful courtship, Jake surprised her by proposing. Now, Rachel prayed their union wasn&#39;t just a convenience and that Jake truly loved her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jake had promised his dying brother he&#39;d care for his little girl, so he needed a wife. But as he wed this beautiful woman and brought her home, he realized his feelings didn&#39;t stem from duty. He loved Rachel McKaslin fiercely. Would God&#39;s providence enable him to survive his dangerous assignment and return to confess his true feelings?&lt;/p&gt;
