      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Jessa Talbot&#39;s boss offered her a promotion, she agreed--no questions asked. Her family needed the money, but fighting the attraction she feels for her brooding employer is tough. Worse, she instantly bonds with his infant son she&#39;s caring for. But this is a temporary solution and she can&#39;t get attached to either of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finnegan Dean is cursed. He&#39;s a nicely dressed monster, the wolf inside always looking for a way out. But there are two things he and his wolf agree on. They must protect baby Oscar and Jessa--his mate. While the wolf hungers to seal their bond, Finn fights the instinct. After all, if he really cares for her, he&#39;d never doom her to the life he lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Books in the Blood Moon Brotherhood series:&lt;br&gt;Falling for the Billionaire Wolf and His Baby&lt;br&gt;Rescued by the Wolf&lt;br&gt;Protecting the Wolf&#39;s Mate&lt;/p&gt;" />
