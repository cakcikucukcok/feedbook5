  <title>Bedding the Enemy - Mary Wine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Laird Keir McQuade is a newcomer to his title, and has much work before him to restore the McQuade honor. Finding a wife is an excellent start. He&#39;s duty-bound to go to court and swear homage to his king anyway, a perfect opportunity--were not court women trussed in stupid fashions and corrupted with false mannerisms. Of course, not every lady hides behind a powdered face.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helena Knyvett may be a daughter of the aristocracy, but in truth she is little but a pawn in her brother&#39;s ploys for power. Her smallest acts of defiance carry a heavy price. But one honorable man among a crowd of dandies could give her all she needs to change her fortunes--and set her free.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among the ruthless ambitions of England&#39;s powerful, love at first sight is a dangerous game. But the treachery, scandal, and treason that follow can unleash as much passion as it does adventure.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Sweeps you into the time period without taking a thing away from delightful characters and a charming romance.  .  .definitely a must-read.&quot;  --Heather Graham on &lt;i&gt;In Bed with a Stranger&lt;/i&gt;" />
