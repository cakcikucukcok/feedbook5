  <title>Psychic Widow - Karen Canavan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Penelope West makes a living as an artist and art teacher. Widowed at a young age by a brutal ex-husband, she now enjoys her independent life. In her spare time, she uses her spiritual gifts to bring comfort to those in her audience who need it the most. At one particular charity event, she locks eyes with the handsome Russell Edwards. Feeling like she knows him somehow, - especially when her guide tells her they are soul mates - she&#39;s intrigued, but fun is all she&#39;s willing to give following the scars her ex-husband left behind. Russell is engaged to the uninteresting Grace when he first set eyes on the mysterious Penelope West. The handsome solicitor becomes hooked on the psychic&#39;s beauty and mystery. Curious beyond measure, he finds himself looking her up in the gallery where her art work is displayed. But could curiosity turn into love when Russell is engaged to another. With a crazy stalker in the mist and revelations of the former husband, could there ever be a happily ever after for the psychic and bored solicitor." />
