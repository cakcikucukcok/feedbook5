  <title>Home Is Where The Heart Is - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If it wasn&#39;t for bad luck, twenty-year-old Jamie would have none at all. With his only family being the aunt who raised him, and who now resides in a nursing home, Jamie is a step away from being homeless and forced to beg on the corner to survive. As bad as things are, Jamie is not a quitter, starting each day with the mantra &quot;It will get better than this.&quot;
Today is Valentine&#39;s Day and little does Jamie know things are about to get a lot better for him. The one bright spot in his life, Paula an older woman who has befriended him, has also had some bad luck and despite being an amazing woman is alone.
Deciding to do something nice for Paula to repay her kindness, Jamie spends his last few dollars on a rose and a card for her. She is thrilled when he gives them to her, and Jamie feels good that he has made her happy.
What Jamie doesn&#39;t know yet is that sweet gesture is about to get him so much more in return.
