  <title>The Rider - R. D. Amundson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;After marrying his childhood sweetheart, Virgil John Jordan is pulled into the Civil War as a captain in the Confederate Army. He is a dedicated and brave soldieruntil news reaches him that his family, including his new wife, has been murdered by marauding Blue Coats. Rage takes over; as Virgil becomes a murderer, the man he once was disappears.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;He becomes The Rider, a vengeful, ghostly foe. Justice is decided by his hand, and he kills those he believes deserve to die. After killing four men who were abusing a whore, the Rider survives a terrible blizzard, only to end up in a town called Witchita. With his only companionhis horse, Gabrielthe Rider finds himself in a very strange place.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The witch in Witchita refers to Mesmerala, a powerful sorceress who runs things with the power of magic. Its not magic that breaks through the Riders heart of steel, though; its a gun-toting honey named Pistol Ann. Rider comes to realize hes in Witchita for a reason. His bloodlust can serve a purpose, but will he ever find his way home again?&lt;/P&gt;" />
