  <title>Suddenly, Annie&#39;s Father (And Baby Makes Three, Book 11) - Sherryl Woods</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Don&#39;t miss this all-time favorite story about finding happiness in unexpected places from &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Sherryl Woods&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Slade Sutton never really thought of himself as a father, but his motherless young daughter was proof to the contrary. So when Annie was suddenly dropped into his lap, Slade knew he needed help. And he&#39;d take it from anyone–except, that is, the infuriatingly flirtatious Val Harding. Why, if Slade wasn&#39;t careful, that little lady would have him roped and tied before he knew it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sure, Val knew a challenge when she saw one–and ex-rodeo star Slade clearly qualified. But somehow she saw through his tough demeanor to the irresistible cowboy at heart. Now if she could just convince Slade that they were all meant to be together…&lt;/p&gt;
