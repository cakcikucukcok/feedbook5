  <title>The River&#39;s End - J.G. Jakes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Hayton McCoy is forced to face the ugliness of racism in the Georgia-South, does she risk losing the young man she vowed to marry, her friends, and her popularity? Or does she help her new friend, Rosie King, secure a chance to follow her dreams? Standing up for what you believe is right becomes a hard choice for the beautiful, young woman of McAllister&amp;#39;s Lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Wilkes, who has fallen in love with Hayton, not only continuously comes to her defense, but also puts his life on the line to save her from a disastrous fate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rosie King, running from hatred and bigotry, finds herself on the doorstep of Katie McAllister McCoy, who also, at one time, was confronted with a terrible injustice left unanswered. However, rather than heeding the advice of Katie--the wise and prudent lady from McAllister&amp;#39;s Lane--Rosie takes justice into her own hands after bullying turns to a deed far more sinister. Her actions pit her and her new friend, Hayton, against dire elements to seek refuge at the river&amp;#39;s end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The River&amp;#39;s End--the third and final book of the &amp;quot;River&amp;#39;s Trilogy&amp;quot; following on the heels of The River&amp;#39;s Edge and The River Rages--brings in a new generation of strong, God-fearing women and a spellbinding story of revenge, forgiveness, and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
