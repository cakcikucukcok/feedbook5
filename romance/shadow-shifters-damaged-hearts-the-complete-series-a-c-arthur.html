  <title>Shadow Shifters: Damaged Hearts, The Complete Series - A. C. Arthur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shadow Shifters: Damaged Hearts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;-a deeply emotional, unforgettable New Adult paranormal romance series by A.C. Arthur about the men who are sworn to protect the females-human or otherwise-from the savage fury of his own nature...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mine to Claim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; Grace Kincaid has been trapped her whole life. Controlled  in every way by her domineering parents, she has never had any moment of  excitement or passion in all her eighteen years. When a rare night out with a friend ends in violence, Grace believes that perhaps her parents  are right to keep her under lock and key. There&#39;s just one problem-she can&#39;t get the irresistibly sexy, mysterious man who saved her from danger out of her head. She knows she should go back to her safe world,  but her newfound passion for life-and for her enigmatic protector-are  making that impossible...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part of Me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lidia Morales has always felt out of place. The one stable presence in her childhood has always been Brayden. Every major moment, every growing pain, everything in her life has been shared with him since they were little, so it makes sense to her that they will stay friends at college together. Until one night, emotions are revealed in a heated kiss, and Lidia&#39;s world is turned upside down. Brayden has always been just a friend and she knows she should look somewhere else for love. But the memory of the passion between them is undeniable-and Brayden isn&#39;t about to let her forget it. As trouble brews, Lidia may need Brayden more than she realized and Brayden will do whatever it takes to convince her that they are soulmates...bonded for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hunger for You&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taken in by a shifter family after his parents&#39; tragic deaths, Caleb Ramsey was thrust into a world of training and loyalty, when his half-breed status should have sentenced him to death. Desperate to escape a family that he can never truly belong to, Caleb leaves at nineteen to find his place outside the Shifter warrior world. The beautiful girl in the bar was not a part of his plan. Neither was finding out more about the boyfriend she claims to have. He should have walked away, should have continued on his own path. But when Caleb realizes the danger Zoe is in, all of his warrior urges come roaring to life...&lt;/p&gt;" />
