      <meta name="description" content="A Mom&#39;s Redemption&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Annie Payton&#39;s lost everything she once held dear. The Village of Hope is her last chance to rebuild the life she&#39;s frittered away so needlessly. But as she works to regain custody of her children, she never imagines an unlikely advocate in her corner&amp;#151;ex-husband Ian Montgomery. Ian&#39;s always willing to help those down on their luck, but his ex-wife&#39;s a different story. Her past betrayal is still a painful memory. As the Village&#39;s lawyer, he&#39;ll represent her&amp;#151;but that&#39;s as far as he&#39;ll allow his feelings to go. Can Annie show Ian that she&#39;s changed in every way but one&amp;#151;the love she still has for him?&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Village of Hope: A community built on love" />
