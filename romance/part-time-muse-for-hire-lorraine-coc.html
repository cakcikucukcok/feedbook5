  <title>Part-Time Muse For Hire - Lorraine Cocó</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hi, I&#39;m Didie. I work as a muse and I have great success in my professional career. 
I&#39;m Didie, I work as a muse and I am very successful in my professional career. I love turning my protégés&#39; lives upside down, and I choose my protégés very carefully. But they need to fulfill my three unbreakable rules. First of all, they have to do everything I ask them to. Second, they always have to be available for us, because we muses are fussy and shine at the most unexpected times. And the last rule, which is the most important of all, is that it is strictly forbidden to fall in love with me. Sometimes my protégés cannot figure out their feelings because of the huge influence I exert on them, but until now I have never had any problem to control the situation. However, I&#39;m not sure but I think that&#39;s about to change. My current protégé is a writer and he is very lost. It&#39;s quite a challenge, taking into account he is stubborn, untrusting, imposing, arrogant, and he tries to break all my rules. Would you join me to find out whether I can manage to make him write his next best-selling novel?&lt;br/&gt;" />
