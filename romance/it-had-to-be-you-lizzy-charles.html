  <title>It Had to Be You - Lizzy Charles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;James Parson has a problem. His military dad is going to yank him out of his expensive boarding school if James doesn&#39;t prove he&#39;s no longer hooking up, pulling pranks, and charming his way out of consequences. What better way to show he&#39;s now responsible than becoming the committed boyfriend of a U.S. diplomat&#39;s daughter? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Level-headed, book-smart Edelweiss may have traveled the world thanks to her dad&#39;s job, but when it comes to friends and boys, she knows exactly nothing. Newly enrolled in boarding school, Edel is now on a mission to learn it all. James says he&#39;ll help her experience the ultimate high school life--if she&#39;ll be his fake girlfriend. And fake is perfect, because he&#39;s exactly the kind of player she&#39;d never date. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains red-hot romance, all the feels, and a soul-mate bad boy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
