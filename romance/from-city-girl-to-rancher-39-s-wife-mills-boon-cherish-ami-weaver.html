  <title>From City Girl to Rancher&#39;s Wife (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Ami Weaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;COOKING UP A HAPPY ENDING?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Josie Callahan is used to cooking up a storm in the big city. But when her life in Los Angeles falls apart, she jumps at the chance to start over as a private chef in Montana. More used to stilettos and stainless steel appliances than cowboy boots and cozy kitchens, Josie is out of her element…especially with her sexy boss, who doesn&#39;t think she&#39;ll last.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Former country music star Luke Ryder has been a loner since personal tragedy brought him low. Josie is a palate cleanser for the reclusive rancher, who prefers horses to heartbreakers. But Luke can&#39;t resist his new employee&#39;s bright smile and bubbly ways, which soften his heart. A delicious happily-ever-after might be just what Luke ordered!&lt;/p&gt;
