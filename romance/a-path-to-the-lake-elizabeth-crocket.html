  <title>A Path to the Lake - Elizabeth Crocket</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kate Browning longs to experience a life of her own again after caring for her parents the past two years. However, her sister Heather&amp;rsquo;s escalating depression threatens to thrust Kate into the role of family caregiver once again.&lt;br /&gt;
Hungry for companionship, Kate begins a relationship with Frank Fetiscina, who was there when she and Heather needed him.&lt;br /&gt;
A part-time writer, she is offered an opportunity writing an inspiration column for the local paper by the editor, Tom Smythe. Kate is instantly attracted to him, and they begin a flirtatious and sexual relationship with no ties between them.&lt;br /&gt;
While Kate is on a date at the bistro with Frank one evening, Tom walks in unexpectedly. Tired of the expectations Frank places on her and the lack of commitment from Tom, Kate tells them she is done and storms out, realizing it&amp;rsquo;s time to take charge of her own life again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
