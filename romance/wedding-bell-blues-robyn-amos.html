  <title>Wedding Bell Blues - Robyn Amos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s everything a girl could want...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And everything this girl wants to run from!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moni Lawrence can&#39;t believe her good fortune! Thanks to an unexpected inheritance, she&#39;s leaving her tiny Virginia hometown in the dust and heading west to spread her wings and fly free. But she makes more of a splash than she intended in San Diego, when she&#39;s so distracted by the sight of a naked man, she drives her car through his fence and into his swimming pool. It&#39;s understandable, since Grant Forrest is so fine he&#39;d turn any woman&#39;s head. And when it&#39;s been decided (in court!) that Moni has to personally repair the damage -- and is going to be around him a lot -- she knows she&#39;d better keep her passion in check, or else she might end up uttering those deadly, reedom-suffocating words, &quot;I do!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Grant&#39;s been disastrously down that aisle twice already and isn&#39;t looking for Mrs. Number Three. Besides, he obviously thinks Moni&#39;s just a sexy, perky, destructive featherhead and serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what&#39;s that glint in his dreamy dark eyes?&lt;/p&gt;" />
