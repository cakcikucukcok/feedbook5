  <title>Talk British to Me - Robin Bielman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the Dating Guy on L.A.&#39;s top morning show, I give the single guy&#39;s perspective on dating, love, and sex--and I give great advice. Everyone&#39;s hooking up...well, except for me. Sure, I can get any woman I want, but I&#39;ve got a &quot;no relationship&quot; clause in my contract and the only woman I want has &quot;relationship&quot; written all over her. Probably stamped on her ass, too. And wouldn&#39;t I like to confirm that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, she wants nothing to do with me. At all. Something about the next Ice Age might have even come up in her rebuttal. Adorable. Because she&#39;s determined to ignore what one simple kiss proved: she wants me as badly as I want her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything in me is screaming to go after her, but I&#39;ve got a secret that I&#39;m fairly certain will end up with her roasting my nuts over an open fire. So, job on the line? Check. Nuts on the line? Check. Can&#39;t get her out of my head? Nail...meet coffin. But what a way to go...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Wherever You Go series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Talk British to Me&lt;br&gt;* Lips Close to Mine&lt;br&gt;* Too Hard to Resist&lt;/p&gt;" />
