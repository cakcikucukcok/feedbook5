  <title>Love, War, and Betrayal - Margaret McCulloch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ernie Tennyson, a southern Georgia farm boy, is on the verge of becoming a mana dangerous time for a teenager in 1967. Before he knows it, he has been drafted and is on his way to serve his country in Vietnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his first mission, he is brutally stabbed by the Viet Cong and left to die in the jungle, where a young woman named Anna Ming finds him and rescues him. Despite her best efforts to conceal his presence and their growing love from her father, Ernie is captured by the North Vietnamese and imprisoned. His time in the camp is so traumatic that he returns home to the United States a profoundly wounded man. Stripped of his memory, the soldier fights to readjust to civilian life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promised to another man, Anna Ming must now conceal another secret: the baby she carries. Her enraged father sends her to China, where she gives birth to a stillborn baby girl. When Anna finally reaches Ernie by phone, he doesnt know who she is. Ernie is further confused when a Vietnamese woman named Laquan shows up and claims she is his wife, forming an unwelcome presence in his life. After a tragic accident brings his memory back, he sends the romantic imposter back to Vietnam and tries to find Anna. Shortly after Annas father tells Ernie that she is dead, the old man is murdered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of Annas grandmother, can Ernie solve the murder and finally marry the woman he loves?&lt;/p&gt;" />
