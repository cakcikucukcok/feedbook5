  <title>The Devil Wears Tartan - Karen Ranney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A man in the shadows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some say he is dangerous. Others say he is mad. None of them knows the truth about Marshall Ross, the Devil of Ambrose. He shuns proper society, sworn to let no one discover his terrible secret. Including the  beautiful woman he has chosen to be his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fallen woman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only desperation could bring Davina McLaren to the legendary Edinburgh castle to become the bride of  a man she has never met. Plagued by scandal, left with no choices, she has made her bargain with the devil. And now she must share his bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fire unlike any they&#39;ve ever known&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the moment they meet, Davina and Marshall are rocked by an unexpected desire that leaves them only yearning for more. But the pleasures of the marriage bed cannot protect them from the sins of  the past. With an enemy of Marshall&#39;s drawing ever closer and everything they now cherish most at stake, he and Davina must fight to protect the passion they cannot deny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
