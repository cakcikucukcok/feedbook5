  <title>Nothing In The World - Luz Divina Malro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Synopsis&lt;br/&gt;
More than a decade ago, without WhatsApp, GPS or any of these smart mobile devices, in an era when cell phones were only used for calling and maybe short text messages, we always found the way to talk and communicate with our friends, family or our loved ones. Because when it is true love, there are no barriers, not physical nor digital.&lt;br/&gt;
The paths of Alan, a 33 years old young man, owner of a famous restaurant in Madrid, and Ruth, a 21 years old student, converged on a cold and rainy morning in the city. Their love was born between the four walls of his restaurant, but Alan seems more concerned about his business than about her, or even about himself, which lead both of them to feel ostracized and lonely. Could Alan&#39;s love for Ruth be enough to make him let everything go? Or is it better to just go separate ways? If you want to know how this love story ends, with all its humor, romance and eroticism, you can&#39;t miss reading Nothing in the World.&lt;br/&gt;
And now, let&#39;s go back to the past.&lt;br/&gt;" />
