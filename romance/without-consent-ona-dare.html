  <title>Without Consent - Ona Dare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;#39;s always fantasized about raping a woman, taking her without her consent. The desire has now become an obsession, one that he needs to make real. He searches for the right woman, picks her out of a lunchtime crowd, and follows her home that evening. Making her his own will satisfy his father&amp;#39;s threats of disinheritance. He will take her by force, but please her and satisfy her sexual needs until she melts in his arms. She will be his.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m dressed in all black, with a black hood and plastic mask over it. There&amp;rsquo;s no way she will see my face. I can hear the lock snick. Good to go. I open the door and step inside, two cats running to see who&amp;rsquo;s there. The light in the living room is much too bright and I walk along the lamps and quietly unscrew the lightbulbs enough that they go off. I slide along the walls and finally unplug the TV. She&amp;rsquo;s still asleep. She must have had several glasses of wine tonight. Good girl.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As silently as possible, I step close to her head and slap the duct tape over her mouth while also trying to prevent her hands from ripping it off. She&amp;rsquo;s dazed with sleep&amp;hellip;I was right about the wine. None too gently, I pull her upright and zip-tie her hands behind her back. She&amp;rsquo;s crying and trying so hard to scream, but the duct tape is doing a beautiful job in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I put a silk sleep mask over her eyes, a black hood over her head, and march her out the back door to push her into the van where I tie her ankles together. It&amp;rsquo;s done. After all the waiting&amp;hellip;after all the fantasies, it&amp;rsquo;s almost done. Now I need to drive to our ultimate destination and the party will begin. I think you will be surprised by how I proceed from this point forward." />
