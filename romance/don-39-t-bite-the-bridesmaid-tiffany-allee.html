  <title>Don&#39;t Bite the Bridesmaid - Tiffany Allee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Don&#39;t Bite the Bridesmaid by Tiffany Allee, Alice Shepard needs one thing: a date for her sister&#39;s wedding. And not just any date. A hunk who will make her fiancé rue the day he left her for her best friend. Her drop-dead gorgeous neighbor fits the bill--even if he is a bit quirky and never comes out during the day--and Alice has downed just enough appletinis to ask him. But she makes it quite clear that there will be no funny business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spending a week on a cruise ship full of humans while sleeping close to his sexy next-door neighbor sounds like a helluva bad idea to vampire Noah Thorpe. But his friends need time to get him out of a shotgun wedding--a vampire bonding that will tie his fate to a female vampire he&#39;s never met. And Alice&#39;s offer comes at just the right time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What could possibly go wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Sons of Kane series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Don&#39;t Bite the Bridesmaid&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Don&#39;t Blackmail the Vampire&lt;/p&gt;" />
