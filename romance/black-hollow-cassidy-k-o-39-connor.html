  <title>Black Hollow - Cassidy K. O&#39;Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Black Hollow, the most paranormal town in America. When your mayor is a Griffin and the local diner is run by mermaid&amp;#39;s serving fish and chips, you know you&amp;rsquo;ll never have a mundane day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sarah hasn&amp;rsquo;t been in a relationship since she left her abusive ex-husband. When her close friends invite her to a weekend in Black Hollow she takes her first step toward moving on. What she doesn&amp;rsquo;t expect is to meet a man or Frankenstein&amp;rsquo;s monster in Adam&amp;#39;s case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adam has lived his life hidden from the world, tired of the stares from strangers. He roamed for centuries tortured by not being able to age or die. He found solace in Black Hollow, it was the perfect place to be himself and forge friendships with other immortals. Until Sarah comes along and he finds the one thing he can&amp;rsquo;t live without. Complete acceptance and love.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nothing is ever as easy as that though, someone wants to keep humans out of Black Hollow and Sarah is the first victim. Can Adam save her and his future?&lt;/p&gt;" />
