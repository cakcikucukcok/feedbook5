  <title>Billionaire Scandal - J.l. Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reluctant billionaire&amp;nbsp;Alexander&amp;nbsp;Jacobs was not prepared for the events that would forever change his life. His parents were killed by a drunk driver, and now, he was forced to run their corporate empire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While he enjoyed the fruits of his family&amp;#39;s business, he was too young to manage the company on his own. He was dreading the upcoming funeral for his parents, but when he saw that his longtime friend Brienne Warhol would be there, it made him feel better.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was attending Columbia Law School, but when she heard about&amp;nbsp;Alexander&amp;#39;s parents, she knew she had to be with him. He went to college locally and missed her friendship when she left for New York. She fantasized about him constantly, but he only thought of her as &amp;quot;one of the guys.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When she finally graduated, they met up for a celebratory glass or two of champagne. She had too much to drink, and before she could stop herself, she kissed him. Deeply. Her head was spinning, and after he looked at her like she crossed the line, she felt sick.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She wished she could take back that damn kiss. Did Brienne ruin her chances of a romantic relationship with billionaire Alexander, the only man she&amp;#39;s ever wanted in her life, or did her &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; spark something inside him that he&amp;#39;d never felt before?&lt;br /&gt;
