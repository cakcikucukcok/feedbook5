  <title>Happened In Tuscany - Lorena Franco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When you think you know all the answers, the universe comes and changes all the questions.&lt;br/&gt;
Discover what happened in Tuscany: A unique and special story that will conquer and delight the most romantic readers.&lt;br/&gt;
Alice Morgan is a writer of romantic novels in her forties, whose inspiration has abandoned her since she divorced Jack. She doesn’t get used to her new life without him and her teenage daughter, who many times seems to want to make his life impossible.&lt;br/&gt;
Mark Hope is a reputed chef and owner of various restaurants, but a bad critic can destroy what has mattered most in life so far: his career.&lt;br/&gt;
Alice and Mark meet because of her literary agent and his sister: Cindy Hope. She organizes a disastrous date in New York that ends earlier than expected.&lt;br/&gt;
What they could never imagine, is that, Alice and Mark together with her teenage daughter, end up in the same family home of the Hope family, located on a beautiful hill of Montepulciano (Tuscany) because of a &quot;confusion&quot; of Cindy.&lt;br/&gt;
Enticing characters will join a delightful story, full of surprises and great moments. The voices of Alice and Mark intermingle, making us believe that second chances really do exist and they may be better than we expected, despite the consequences.&lt;br/&gt;" />
