  <title>Baton Rouge Twilight - Liz Kilger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Baton Rouge Twilight is the true continuation of the storyline begun in Krewes Knight.  This book in the series is actually book three for me.  I did do a separate book, Monona Days, a home town girl in Madison, WI only to come back to my original series.  Krewes Knight introduced the Devereaux Clan of New Orleans, LA.  Lucian and Alexix Thorndyke Devereaux was the starting place for this series.  This book continues on with Langley Devereaux, the real hero of book one.  Here Langley accepts a position with the FBI to take over and operate the new Baton Rouge branch of the FBI. With a crew of his own, he tackles the latest influx of Male Noche bandis from South America. But Langley has met and invited a new doctor into his home to save her from these vicious thugs. Romance is in the air with this beautiful down to earth woman that has stirred his interests.  They marry, even leave on a honeymoon, shortened by the escape then capture of the escapees in Indiana where they are honeymooning.  With the wonderful help of his brother and father, Langley flies up to Indiana.  Then rent a huge Motor Home to tour the State of Alicias birth.  The escape of Courtney Anderson and  Tritan Nobels and their capture by Indianna State Police brought the jet from Devereaux family  right back up to Indianna.
But more surprises were in store for these newlyweds.  The introduction of four young children into their new marriage." />
