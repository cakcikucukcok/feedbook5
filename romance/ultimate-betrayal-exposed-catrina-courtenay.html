      <meta name="description" content="When you&#39;ve been betrayed by your best friend, and a psychotic serial rapist is stalking your every move, nothing much should surprise Ronnie Harper. Determined to take back her life, she starts fresh, taking on a new business partner and for the first time in years, a man that cares for her. As Ronnie and Erik are throw into one unimaginable situation after another, her faith in herself is pushed to the limit. She doubts the people around her, her own judgment and even Erik&#39;s growing feelings for her. He&#39;s relentless and even when she pushes him away, he won&#39;t give up, though he doesn&#39;t realize it may be the only way to protect him from Jeff and his psychotic brother, Kincaid. When they are confronted with the worst imaginable situation, Kincaid puts their love to the test. Is their bond strong enough to survive the dark, twisted mind of a sadistic rapist? Or will Ronnie&#39;s past eventually destroy them?" />
