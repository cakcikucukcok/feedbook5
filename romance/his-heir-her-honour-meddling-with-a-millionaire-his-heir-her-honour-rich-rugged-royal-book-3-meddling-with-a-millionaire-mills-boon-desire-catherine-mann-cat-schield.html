  <title>His Heir, Her Honour / Meddling With A Millionaire: His Heir, Her Honour (Rich, Rugged &amp; Royal, Book 3) / Meddling with a Millionaire (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) - Catherine Mann, Cat Schield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;His Heir, Her Honour Royal and a doctor, Carlos Medina knew he couldn’t have children.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Lilah Anderson insisted their night together had resulted in her pregnancy. The mum-to-be had never cheated on her lover; she had given him her heart, asking nothing in return. Now he wanted to marry her – for the sake of the child. Was she asking too much by insisting he give her his love with his ring?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;MEDDLING WITH A MILLIONAIRE&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Emma Montgomery wouldn’t be manipulated into marriage as part of a business deal – not even if Daddy cut off access to her trust fund. The talented jewellery designer would just make her own way. Too bad her intended groom – maverick businessman and former crush Nathan Case – made her stubborn stance so difficult. The heat of his touch had her nearly betraying herself at every turn!&lt;/p&gt;
