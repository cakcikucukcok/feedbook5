      <meta name="description" content="Through the beauty of music, brings love and the will to live a life lost.&lt;br /&gt;
It is only at the pianoforte with beautiful music flowing from her fingertips that Teresa Seton is happy. New to English society, she feels awkward and unsure of herself. &amp;nbsp;Only the attentions of her handsome neighbor can convince her that she is where she belongs&amp;mdash;a stolen kiss proves that he means what he says. But the kiss is witnessed and the pair is forced to marry for propriety&amp;rsquo;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;
Once known as the &amp;ldquo;Merry Marquis&amp;rdquo;, Richard, the Marquis of Merrick, now lives the life of a recluse. Finding a beautiful stranger at his pianoforte strikes a chord within him, bringing back feelings he thought were lost with the passing of his wife. He is mesmerized by Teresa and her beautiful music, but can he convince her, and himself, that he can live and love again?" />
