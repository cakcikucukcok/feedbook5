  <title>Bad For Me - Codi Gary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Codi Gary&amp;#39;s back with another installment in her fan-favorite Rock Canyon series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callie Jacobsen isn&amp;#39;t about to open her heart to just anyone. Not so very long ago, trusting someone changed her life forever&amp;#8212;and not in a fun way. Now she&amp;#39;s better off focusing on her career, her friends, and her dog. So when former Marine Everett Silverton takes an interest in her, Callie&amp;#39;s more than a little wary. No matter how charming he is, men are a bad idea. In fact, she&amp;#39;s got the scars to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Everett isn&amp;#39;t convinced Callie should shut everyone out&amp;#8212;especially not him. He may be a hero to the people of Rock Canyon, but he&amp;#39;s got his own demons, and he bets they&amp;#39;re not that different from Callie&amp;#39;s. Still, he knows it&amp;#39;s going to take more than chemistry to get her to let her guard down. Everett will do whatever it takes to show her she&amp;#39;s safe with him. All she has to do is take a chance, take a step &amp;#8230; and take his hand.&lt;/p&gt;" />
