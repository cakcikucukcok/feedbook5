When Margot comes home and discovers her son has had a party while she was away and totally fucked up her house. She&amp;#39;s pissed but when she discovers her son&amp;#39;s packing a giant dick, she thinks of a punishment than works out best for both of them.&lt;br /&gt;

EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Fred moaned in pleasure and put his head back down again. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what had come over his sexy mom, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Margot sucked her son&amp;rsquo;s cock into her mouth for a moment before taking it out again, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s too big son, you can&amp;rsquo;t expect me to,&amp;rdquo; Then she put her mouth over his cock again and gave it a few more sucks, before taking her mouth off his cock again, &amp;ldquo;No way son, there&amp;rsquo;s just no way your fuckstick can fit,&amp;rdquo; and then she sucked it about halfway down his shaft and stayed there for a moment, getting used to it as it started to fill her throat, then her head off his dick again, &amp;ldquo;Son, you can&amp;rsquo;t do this to your Mommy. You can&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; and then she sucked him all the way in, feeling her son&amp;rsquo;s cock go down her throat, she started to really suck his dick, moving faster and faster as she did so." />
