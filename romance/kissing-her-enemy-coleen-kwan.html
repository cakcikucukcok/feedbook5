      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amber Miller has worked hard to get her small business thriving. Now the Wright family wants to tear down her store to put up a mega center. What&#39;s even worse, the guy who broke her heart in high school is the new CEO of Wright Inc.

His plans should put them on the upswing. But he didn&#39;t count on Amber Miller standing in his way, as fiery and stubborn as she was years ago. And the more time he spends with her, the harder it is to resist falling for her again. The only problem is he&#39;s everything she doesn&#39;t want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each title in the Pine Falls series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Unexpectedly Yours&lt;br&gt;* Kissing Her Enemy&lt;br&gt;* Dating for Keeps&lt;/p&gt;" />
