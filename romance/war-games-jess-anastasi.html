      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When one of her pilots is shot down behind enemy lines, Lieutenant Theresa Brenner will stop at nothing to save her before she&#39;s captured and tortured, even if it means being part of the dirtside team led by Colonel Cameron McAllister. Bren might respect the way the colonel commands his men, but she&#39;ll never trust Cam--no matter how charming he is--because he was responsible for her brother&#39;s death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonel Cameron McAllister has a covert mission behind enemy lines to team with the Ilari rebels and overthrow the bloodthirsty dictator who&#39;s torn their planet apart. The last thing he needs is to get sidetracked searching for a downed pilot, especially since it means having Lieutenant Theresa Brenner tag along. Not only doesn&#39;t the frosty pilot have the ground game to keep up with his seasoned group, she&#39;s a potential distraction with all those gorgeous blond curls of hers--and she might be just like her brother, whose foolhardiness got his men killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Valiant Knox series is STANDALONE.&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Escape Velocity&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Damage Control&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Cover Fire&lt;br&gt;Book #4 War Games&lt;/p&gt;" />
