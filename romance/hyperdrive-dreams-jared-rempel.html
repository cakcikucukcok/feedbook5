Fate seems to smile upon him further when he meets a beautiful girl named Tanis while spending a month-long furlough upon Siluna, a planet a portion of the way to their destination, and falls in love again, reawakening in him, for the first time in years, the fires of passion. But his whole world is thrown into confusion one day when he receives a message from one of his shipmates, summoning him to a candid conversation in the ships lounge, where he learns not only that hes been watched for years but also of a revolutionary plan to takeover the shipand the part that he might play in it. So coaxed by Tanis not only into using the very technology whereby he creates dreams for the convicts in Cryogenic freezing but also into using it to further the revolutionary plan, Adrian throws away everything he knows and commits himself to the cause." />
