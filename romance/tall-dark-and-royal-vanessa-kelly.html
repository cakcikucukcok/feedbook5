  <title>Tall, Dark and Royal - Vanessa Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He&#39;s the man behind the mission to track down the illegitimate children of England&#39;s Royal Princes and help them get their due. But his deepest desire is far more personal...&lt;P&gt;Magnificent and stubborn. Fourteen years apart had not changed Chloe Steele, or Dominic Hunter&#39;s love for her. He&#39;d been a street urchin, a boy raised at court, and finally a magistrate, yet he&#39;d never belonged anywhere--except by her side. Now Chloe devoted herself to girls threatened by scandal--like she had been. But she was in danger, and Dominic was determined to help--and hopefully make up for lost time...&lt;P&gt;Even in childhood, Dominic had made Chloe feel safe. Now she also felt thrillingly flustered by the powerful man he&#39;d become, and by the longing he inspired. Because Dominic meant not only to protect her, but to untangle the lies that had separated them. Yet for Chloe, surrendering to temptation may be easier than risking a future that could ruin them both...&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Praise for Vanessa Kelly&#39;s Renegade Royals series&lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;Has all the elements of my favorite novels--a bad boy hero, a spirited heroine, a dash of intrigue, and a sizzling romance. Put her on your auto-buy list;you won&#39;t be disappointed.&quot; --Shana Galen&lt;P&gt;&quot;Will definitely resonate with fans of Mary Jo Putney and Joanne Bourne.&quot; --&lt;I&gt;Booklist&lt;/I&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;Diverting dialogue, delightful surprises and finely tuned pacing to make this a winner.&quot; --&lt;I&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;/I&gt; (starred review)&lt;p&gt;36,000 Words" />
