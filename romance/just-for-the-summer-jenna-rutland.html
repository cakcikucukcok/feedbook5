  <title>Just for the Summer - Jenna Rutland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dani Sullivan has come to Lake Bliss to write her latest cookbook and take a breather. After the year she&#39;s had, she deserves a summer retreat to reevaluate priorities and make peace with past decisions. But from the moment single dad and sheriff Matt Reagan shows up, she has a hard time convincing herself that a life away from Lake Bliss could beat the life she might have here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently divorced Matt is ready for a new relationship, but he doesn&#39;t want short-term--his son needs permanence, and so does Matt&#39;s heart. Unfortunately, it&#39;s the smart-mouthed and sinfully sexy Ms. Sullivan who catches his eye. But when Matt learns Dani&#39;s secrets, will he still want her to stay? Or will her chance for love last just for the summer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Each book in the Lake Bliss series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Just for the Summer&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Just for Appearances&lt;/p&gt;" />
