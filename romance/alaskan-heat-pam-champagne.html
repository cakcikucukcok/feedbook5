  <title>Alaskan Heat - Pam Champagne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;FBI agent Joe &quot;Hawk&quot; Hawkins is on the run. He&#39;s been framed and the only chance he has of clearing his name is in Eagle, Alaska. Just when he thinks he couldn&#39;t be in any more trouble, a woman from his past catches up with him. Sophie&#39;s a brilliant statistician who works for the agency. She&#39;s still ticked off about their disastrous one-night stand, but she also has an offer for him--a deal he can&#39;t refuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that Sophie&#39;s first field assignment involves Hawk does complicate matters. She&#39;s never forgotten or forgiven Hawk for the night he found his way to her bed and left her wanting more. Now she has two objectives--get Hawk to finish what he started that hot night, and get them both to Eagle alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alcan Highway can be long and hazardous. But with a heat neither of them expected drawing them together, and two rogue agents on their tail, they might reach their destination sooner than they think.&lt;/p&gt;" />
