For Zack Covington, Anna-Grace&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#34;Gracie&amp;#34;&amp;#8212;was the one. Until one night forever alters the course of their future, when a devastated Gracie disappears without a trace, leaving Zack to agonize over what happened to the girl he loved. As the years pass, his desperate efforts to find her uncovered nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now working for Devereaux Security, he stumbles across a painting featuring a special place only he and Gracie would know. The image is too perfectly rendered for it to be coincidence. His Gracie must be &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt;. When he finally tracks her down, he is shocked&amp;#8212;and heart-broken&amp;#8212;to discover the wounded shell of the girl he once knew and still loves. Her psychic gifts are gone, and worse, she believes he betrayed her all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zack has enemies, and once his weakness is discovered, Gracie becomes a target for revenge. He&amp;#39;ll have to save her before he can earn her trust and her love. And he vows they&amp;#39;ll never be torn apart again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
