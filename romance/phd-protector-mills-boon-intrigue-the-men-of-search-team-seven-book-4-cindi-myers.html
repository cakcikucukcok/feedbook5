  <title>Phd Protector (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (The Men of Search Team Seven, Book 4) - Cindi Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Calculating the odds on their fate isn’t exactly rocket science…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nuclear physicist Mark Renfro will do anything to keep his daughter safe, including building a “suitcase nuke” for the radical group that killed his wife. Imprisoned alone in a make-shift lab, Mark has all but given up hope of seeing his daughter again. Until his captors provide an assistant--the beautiful stepdaughter of the terrorist leader.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Angry and defiant, Erin Daniels has no intention of assisting anyone – including a gorgeous scientist. That is, until a time bomb is strapped around her neck. They have one week to finish…or Erin dies. Mark knows he’s Erin’s only hope for survival. And she’s his only hope for a future.&lt;/p&gt;
