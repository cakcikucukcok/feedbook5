  <title>Samson’S Diary - Bob Arnone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In an effort to protect her child from the harsh realities of her impending death, Mary pours her heart into a diary, her legacy to her challenged ten-year-old son, Samson. After her passing, the grief-stricken child writes longingly to his lost momma, in the hopes that his fervent words might reach her in the great beyond.&lt;p&gt; 
Born with extraordinary powers found only in the primate world, he is a mystery to the medical world. His doctors know of a progressive tumor on his thyroid, but even that cant explain his gigantism. At ten, he is 69 and weighs 175 pounds. Nora, his devoted nanny, loves him as if he was her own flesh and blood, and she does her best to encourage the boy. When his mental abilities also begin to grow beyond expectations, only his father believes that it is the work of Mary, his dead wife.&lt;p&gt; 
At sixteen, 76, and 275 pounds, hes on the verge of harnessing his true potential. Soon, hes on his way to glory in professional sports and folk-hero status, but theres a powerful emptiness to his life. Tragedy follows him everywhere. He continues to write to his momma, desperate to know why he keeps losing the ones he loves. At nineteen, undaunted by his doctors fears that physical exertion will kill him, he experiences a mystical transformation, with his momma and a phalanx of angels to guide him. When his body betrays him, can theyor should theysave him?" />
