  <title>Falling For The Rebound Bride (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (Wed in the West, Book 10) - Karen Templeton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A ranch for the runaway bride&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Weeks before her wedding, Emily Weber walks away from her planned society shindig and her cheating fiancé—straight to her cousin&#39;s New Mexico ranch. Everyone&#39;s advice: Emily&#39;s got to work it out of her system, and her childhood acquaintance—all six feet of dark good looks—is just the guy to help.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Colin Talbot recognises someone on the run from their life. Hell, the rootless photojournalist hasn&#39;t been on his ranch in years, till now. But he&#39;s not about to indulge in a promise of pleasure, not with a potential for disaster. Emily still wants marriage and babies; he can&#39;t wait to bolt. So he&#39;ll keep his distance before she has him wanting what he can&#39;t have: a family and a forever love.&lt;/p&gt;
