  <title>April&#39;s Fool - Charles E. Magness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Professor Ford is a stuffy, pompous, middle-aged academic devoted to an obscure, esoteric corner of his field. He knows that sex with a student is unethical and out of the question&amp;mdash;and love with anyone, student or not, isn&amp;#39;t even something he can consider. But when vibrant April takes one of his courses, he finds himself skating perilously closer and closer to that forbidden line&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nevertheless, it was with some trepidation that I arrived early in my numerical analysis class the next day. After the previous day&amp;#39;s misstep, I was edgy, but I still wanted to see April. Of course, I enjoyed watching from my habitual perch at the front of the room as her delightful female body settled into its seat in the center of the first row. I was even more entranced that day than usual, because, for the first time since I&amp;#39;d become acquainted with her, she was wearing a skirt&amp;mdash;a short skirt. And she contrived to show me bare thigh&amp;mdash;a lot of bare thigh&amp;mdash;as she seated herself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think I managed to conceal my lechery. I didn&amp;#39;t let my eyes bulge (very much) nor my jaw drop (very far); other members of the class seemed unaware. But, as she came to rest in her seat, knees together, legs uncrossed, I raised my eyes to look at her face. She was looking directly at me. There was the sneaky little smile&amp;mdash;the one I&amp;#39;d seen when she&amp;#39;d confessed wanting to kiss me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She knew I&amp;#39;d been looking up her skirt! And that little smirk told me that she&amp;#39;d planned that she would make a display, that I would look, that she would catch me, and that she approved! As I digested this bit of information, her smile deepened and she separated her knees a bit&amp;mdash;quite a bit. Reflexively, my gaze dropped to the resulting sight of her yellow panties." />
