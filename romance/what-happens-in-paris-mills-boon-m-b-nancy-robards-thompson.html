          &lt;strong&gt;and the #1 sign that your husband is gay…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;There&#39;s an article in the newspaper telling you so. With a photo, no less.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;OKAY, so in retrospect, maybe there were &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; signs that all was not well in Annabelle Essex&#39;s eighteen-year-old marriage. Now she had to take stock of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She had a wonderful son in college. A job she hated. And a meddlesome sister who insisted that this crisis was really an opportunity in disguise. After all, Annabelle had some dreams left: Paris (she&#39;d always wanted to go) and art (she was a closet painter). So said sister enrolled her in a contest: winner gets a three-month artist-in-residence fellowship in the City of Light. Annabelle was horrified. She couldn&#39;t just give up, could she? Trade in the job she hated for three months in the city she&#39;d never stopped dreaming about? Besides, she&#39;d never win it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;BUT what if she did?&lt;/p&gt;
