  <title>Hot and Bothered - Lori Foster, Laura Bradley, Gayle Callen, Victoria Marquez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sultry encounters, forbidden passion, irresistible temptation-what more could you want in a collection of four scintillating stories by today&#39;s sexiest authors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hot and Bothered&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luring Lucy by Lori Foster: All Lucy was looking for when she went to her vacation home was an innocent fling to quell the yearning she had felt since her husband died four years ago. She never expected her longtime friend Bram to lure her into a love affair so hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth or Dare by Laura Bradley: Undercover P.I. Shay McIntyre takes on the guise of a reporter to uncover who&#39;s behind the suspicious deaths of two bullriders, and finds herself locking horns with the sinfully tempting Luke Wilder in a deliciously wicked game of truth or dare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compromised by Gayle Callen: Country baron John Malory nobly offers to wed Lady Elizabeth Stanwood when they are caught together alone in a garden. Elizabeth never expected to be compromised--or to soon be wed to a man whose affection she does not welcome....until he changes her mind with lingering kisses and a passion she has only dreamed of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treading Dangerous Waters by Victoria Marquez: Sofia&#39;s  plans to relax on a cruise are ruined when she encounters James, her aunt&#39;s future son-in-law, who is intent on breaking up his father&#39;s wedding...unless Sofia can distract him. But she&#39;s treading dangerous waters, for James has designs of his own, which include seducing the Latina beauty until she surrenders completely to him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
