  <title>The Good Neighbor - Amy Sue Nathan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Izzy Lane never thought of herself as a liar. In fact, she&#39;s always played by the rules. She&#39;s an excellent mother, has loyal friends, and a rich career as a school counselor. Fresh from a new divorce, however, Izzy feels like she needs a little fun. So when, on a whim, she starts a blog it seems like a rather benign indulgence. But as her online quips begin to gain traction, Izzy makes a slip. Somehow a new boyfriend winds his way into the picture. The problem? Izzy makes him up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, at first, feels like a harmless fib quickly spins out of control and Izzy must figure out how to balance fantasy and reality. Keeping up appearances while managing an absent ex-husband, two very nosy friends, a toddler son, and full-time job soon prove impossible, and Izzy feels utterly lost. It&#39;s only when her long-time neighbor and surrogate mother, Mrs. Feldman, re-enters her life that Izzy begins to see the mess she&#39;s made. And it&#39;s with Mrs. Feldman&#39;s guidance that Izzy learns to face reality, find comfort in new norms, and open herself up to the possibility of real love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
