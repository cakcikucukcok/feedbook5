everyone else, falls in love with a younger man.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:
yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Due to the heavy baggage of a yet-to-be-terminated marriage which
was doomed from its beginning, strict obedience to religious dogma, her
familys mores, and a strained relationship with her grown daughter, Pearl has
difficulty accepting that she has the right to enjoy her own being, life, and
the pursuit of happiness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

clueless about what the future holds for him.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;He only knows that he was happily married for almost thirty years and is
dubious even thinking about a second relationship, fearing that it would lead
to disappointment because he would always be comparing the new women to his
deceased beloved.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Buried in loneliness,
he becomes heavily involved in volunteer work and begins to imbibe a bit too
much in self-pity and alcohol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

friendships...a&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Voudoun priest and a

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt&#39;&gt;As with all of Jims novels, Sins of Pearl is

reader will laugh a little, cry a little, and think a little.&lt;span

religious doctrine may cause some to think, which is good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
