          &lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Mystery Junction–where danger and desire are just around the corner!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He was a man of secrets, and enigmatic newcomer Jake Collins had the whole town talking.Yet one woman knew who he really was. He&#39;d been Amy Thomas&#39;s first and only love, and he&#39;d vanished from her life without a trace. But the ex-Navy officer had left her with one precious secret of her own…their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, when the time had finally arrived to reveal the truth, Amy found her life suddenly jeopardized by skeletons of the past. And her only source of protection was Jake&#39;s strong embrace. He was a man who&#39;d battled danger daily, who would win at any cost. But dare Amy trust in Jake&#39;s honor once more–allowing herself to succumb to him body and soul? For this time, she could be the one to pay the ultimate price.&lt;/p&gt;
