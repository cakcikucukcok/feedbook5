      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Ceana Sinclair Mead married the youngest son of an Irish duke, she never dreamed that seven years later her beloved Peter would die. Her three brothers-in-law think she should be grateful to remain a proper widow. But after three years of this, she&amp;#39;s ready to scream. She escapes to Scotland, only to discover she&amp;#39;s so much more than just the Widow Mead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Scotland, Ceana crosses paths with Bruce Preston, an American tasked with a dangerous mission by her brother, Macrath. Bruce is too attractive for her peace of mind, but she still finds him fascinating. Their one night together is more wonderful than Ceana could have imagined, and she has never felt more alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the past reaches out in the form of an old foe, Ceana&amp;#39;s life is in danger. Now Bruce must fight to become her savior&amp;#8212;and more&amp;#8212;if she&amp;#39;ll let him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
