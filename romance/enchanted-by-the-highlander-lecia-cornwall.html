  <title>Enchanted by the Highlander - Lecia Cornwall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enchanted by the Highlander&lt;/i&gt; is the fourth book in a charming and enchanting Scottish series that reimagines fairytales by Lecia Cornwall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillian MacLeod is shy and quiet, the least likely of all her sisters to seek out excitement and adventure. But on a moonlit night at a masquerade ball, Gillian steals a kiss from a mysterious stranger, knowing she&#39;ll never see him again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Erly, disowned by his noble English father, started a new life in Scotland. Most people are suspicious of the foreign mercenary and he does everything is his power to avoid romantic entanglements. But he can&#39;t forget the bewitching beauty who kissed him in the dark, and stole his heart, even though he has no idea who she might be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A year later, John is given the duty of escorting Gillian to her wedding and immediately recognizes her as the temptress he&#39;s dreamed of for months. There&#39;s not much he can do when she&#39;s promised to another man, but fate intervenes and this time, passion--and adventure--can&#39;t be denied. Honor demands he stay away from the MacLeod&#39;s enchanting daughter, but love has a very different ending in mind...&lt;/p&gt;" />
