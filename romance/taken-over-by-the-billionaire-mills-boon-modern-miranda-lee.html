  <title>Taken Over by the Billionaire (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Miranda Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Driven to distraction…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hotshot entrepreneur Benjamin Da Silva is used to being in the driving seat, but when he finds himself in need of a chauffeur, beautiful, straight-talking Jess Murphy proves that sometimes taking his foot off the pedal can be equally pleasurable!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jess isn’t impressed by his wealth but each glimpse in the rear-view mirror has her aching to climb into the backseat and submit to Benjamin’s every command. His recent takeover cost her her job and she knows she should steer clear – so why can’t she get off the collision course leading right towards Benjamin?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Taken Over by The Billionaire -&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;4 * RT Book Review&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lee’s kismet-with-kink tale is both riotous and heartfelt, set in the verdant beauty of Australia. Her co-stars range from quirky to conventional, and while her outspoken heroine and stubborn mogul hero seem ill fated, they mesh perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Miranda Lee is a much loved, Mills &amp; Boon author who excels at scandalous, dark and dangerous, brooding billionaires who are used to keeping women for as many nights as they want, and then discarding them! But when they meet someone who throws their best-laid plans off track, will these imposing, irrepressible men be brought to their knees by love?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Praise for Miranda Lee&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Man Without Mercy -&lt;/strong&gt; 4 * RT Book Review&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With tons of personality of its own, Lee’s quirky mansion is the ideal setting for this lively Down Under romance. Her stars are the perfect match for each other, and their passion sizzles.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master of Her Virtue - &lt;/strong&gt;4 * RT Book Review&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lee’s couple fits together well despite their differences, and her love scenes are both playful and seriously hot in this romance that shows how adoration can grow from the physical as well as the emotional.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add a wonderful Miranda Lee title to your collection!&lt;/p&gt;
