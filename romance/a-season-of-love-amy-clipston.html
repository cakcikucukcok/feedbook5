  <title>A Season of Love - Amy Clipston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three young friends enter the most important season of their lives. But relationships have changed, and only time will tell if Lindsay, Katie, and Lizzie Anne have made the right choices.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three young women are about to change their lives: Lizzie Anne and Samuel have decided to get married, and Lindsay is about to be baptized into the Amish faith and is being courted by Matthew. While Katie Kauffman is happy for her friends who seem to have settled their futures, she is also finding herself something of a fifth wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lindsay&amp;rsquo;s sister Jessica returns to Bird-in-Hand, she finds that Jake Miller has moved on with his life. He lost hope that Jessica would ever be satisfied to settle in rural Pennsylvania and takes comfort in becoming close friends with Katie. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not an easy road as Jake is Mennonite and Katie has just been baptized. Her father forbids them to see each other, adamant that his daughter marry an Amish man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a trip to Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania, where you&amp;rsquo;ll meet the delightful women of the Kauffman Amish Bakery in Lancaster County. As each woman&amp;rsquo;s story unfolds, you will share in her joys, dreams . . . and secrets. You&amp;rsquo;ll discover the simplicity of the Amish lifestyle and, most importantly, you will be encouraged by the hope and faith of these women, and the importance they place on their families.&lt;/p&gt;" />
