  <title>Scandalous Again - Christina Dodd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Two exquisite cousins must exchange identities in a scandalous deception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Madeline de Lacy, the duchess of Magnus, prides herself on being one of the most sensible young women in England, which is why she can&#39;t believe that, in a turn of the cards, her noble father has lost  his entire estate -- and her! -- to a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a mission to salvage her family fortune, she changes places with her cousin and companion, sending the meeker Eleanor to confront the man who had won Madeline&#39;s hand. Now, Madeline is free to enter the home of a notorious gambler, and pretends to be meek, humble, and competent with an iron. She is, of course, none of those things; she simply is resolved to win her family&#39;s fortune back. Just when she thinks matters can&#39;t get worse, she meets Gabriel Ansell, the earl of Campion, and they do. Horribly worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, Madeline was engaged to Gabriel, and worshipped his arrogant kisses. Now, being forced to marry a man she doesn&#39;t know pales in comparison to the ordeal of facing Gabriel again, the man who betrayed her -- Gabriel, the only man she ever loved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
