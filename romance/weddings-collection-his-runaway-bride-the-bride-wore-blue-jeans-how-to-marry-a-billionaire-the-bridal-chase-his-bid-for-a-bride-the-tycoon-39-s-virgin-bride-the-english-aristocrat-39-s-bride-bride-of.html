        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIS RUNAWAY BRIDE by Liz Fielding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willow and Mike can&#39;t decide who&#39;s more relieved when each jilts the other at the altar! Having got cold feet, they&#39;ve now decided to pursue their dream jobs rather than marry….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE BRIDE WORE BLUE JEANS by Marie Ferrarella&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between raising his three siblings and running a successful business, Kevin Quintano&#39;s hectic life left no room for love. But when his sister announced her upcoming wedding, Kevin headed to Hades, Alaska, to ensure she made it down the aisle. Of course, Kevin didn&#39;t count on getting bitten by the love bug–or his own thoughts of marriage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO MARRY A BILLIONAIRE by Ally Blake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cara Marlowe&#39;s new TV job will make her career - as long as nothing goes wrong. So it&#39;s bad news that billionaire Adam Tyler wants the show stopped, and it&#39;s worse that Cara can hardly concentrate with the gorgeous tycoon around! Cara doesn&#39;t need billions, but she does want Adam the man - and her job too! Will she have to make a choice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE BRIDAL CHASE by Darcy Maguire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help her sister’ s business, Roxanne Gray takes on a job that means she has to spend a lot of time with successful architect Cade Taylor Watson. It’s really not a chore—he’s tall, handsome and irresistibly attractive! He’s also strictly off-limits; she mustn’t let him get close. But Cade is more than a little bit keen on Roxanne—and so begins a chase that he hopes will end at the altar….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIS BID FOR A BRIDE by Carole Mortimer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Skye O&#39;Hara&#39;s life is rocked by tragedy, she&#39;s reunited with Falkner Harrington - her father&#39;s enigmatic business partner. Needing some time to consider her future, Skye has no other option but to accept when Falkner offers her the sanctuary of his home.But as the tension and chemistry sizzle between them, living with the dark-hearted tycoon becomes a real challenge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE TYCOON’S VIRGIN BRIDE by Sandra Field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night, seventeen-year-old Jenessa&#39;s secret infatuation with millionaire tycoon Bryce Laribee turned to passion…but he discovered she was a virgin, and walked out the door!Jenessa looks so different now, but when Bryce remembers her, all he can think about is their steamy encounter twelve years ago…. He&#39;s determined to finish what they once started! But Jenessa has a secret or two–she&#39;s still in love with Bryce…and she&#39;s still a virgin….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ENGLISH ARISTOCRAT’S BRIDE by Sandra Field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue-blooded millionaire Rafe needs a wife, one who will agree to a loveless marriage. Yet Karyn arouses his deepest desires. Rafe’s no stranger to making ruthless choices. Can he risk more than a marriage in name only and take Karyn as his arranged bride?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BRIDE OF DESIRE by Sara Craven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago Alice Marchington fled a desperately unhappy marriage for the coast of Brittany, where she met irresistible doctor Remy de Brizat. But they were driven apart when he discovered her secret. Distraught by Remy&#39;s dismissal of her, Allie&#39;s only comfort was her discovery that she was pregnant with the Frenchman&#39;s baby. Now Allie had returned to France, realising she has no choice but to tell Remy about his child. Remy offers her what she always wanted, marriage, but though he might worship her with his body, she knows there&#39;s not love in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
