  <title>Without You - Stan Yocum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How deep can love go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pianist Matt Sampson first hears Del Rey Silone sing, he is captivated by the quality of her voice  and her beauty. He also knows that under his direction she could develop a voice that will stun the world. They are both students at one of the most prestigious performing-arts schools in America, and each of them harbors dreams of success. Matt begins tutoring Del Rey, and soon a strong attraction develops between the two artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the young lovers must find the strength to resist the destructive power of success, learning to balance the demands of their careers against the passion of their hearts. Can they survive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the power of Del Reys voice matures under Matts tutelage, Chris Elliot, a powerful musical agent, begins to court Del Rey as a client. But she soon discovers that his desires go beyond having just a professional relationship. Despite the unbelievable monetary rewards he acquires for her, her love for the pianist cannot be broken. Both students soon learn, however, that the strength of their love will undoubtedly be tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Del Reys first album skyrockets up the charts, Chris arranges for her to go on tour, but she cant comprehend being on the road without Matt. He, on the other hand, cant imagine leaving school and giving up on his dream of becoming a composer. While neither can bear the thought of being apart, surrendering their individual dreams of success weighs heavily on their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can their love compete against the applause and adulation of adoring audiences? But more importantly, is either willing to discover what life would be like without the other?&lt;/p&gt;" />
