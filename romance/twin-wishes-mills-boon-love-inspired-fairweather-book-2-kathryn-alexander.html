          &lt;strong&gt;ONE WOMAN&#39;S DREAM&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Julianne Quinn had always dreamed of finding the perfect man and having children. She found every reason to surround herself with toddlers, but was devastated to learn that she couldn&#39;t have children of her own. No amount of goldfish or stray pets could appease Julianne&#39;s loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When handsome widower Luke O&#39;Hara moved to town with his twins, Julianne found herself falling in love with the man&#39;s reluctant smile and his children. Luke&#39;s sudden marriage proposal offered Julianne everything she had always wanted–or did it? Though their devotion to the twins was at the heart of their union, would Julianne and Luke admit their deep love for one another?&lt;/p&gt;
