  <title>Ryan&#39;s Hand - Leila Meacham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A sweeping, classic romance about the ties that bind us together-and the promises that can break us apart ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Some friends are more like family...and that&#39;s exactly how Cara Martin feels about Ryan Langston.  He stood by her side through the most difficult time of her life and there&#39;s nothing she won&#39;t do for him, even now after his death.  But inheriting Ryan&#39;s share of his family&#39;s ranch in west Texas and living there for a year?  Cara doesn&#39;t understand what he was thinking.  Still, she cannot, will not deny Ryan&#39;s last request...even if it means sharing a roof with his brooding, arrogant older brother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Jeth Langston doesn&#39;t trust Cara as far as he can throw her.  Jeth is certain she prevented his baby brother from spending his last days at home.  And he&#39;ll be damned if he lets this stranger take over the Langston family legacy too.  Whatever the cost, he&#39;s determined to drive this beautiful outsider away-no matter how intriguing he finds her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  But as the days grow longer and sunshine sweeps across the plains, Cara can&#39;t help but fall for the untamed land-and the man whose passion for it captures her, heart and soul.  Can their love bloom wild and free on this Texas ranch?" />
