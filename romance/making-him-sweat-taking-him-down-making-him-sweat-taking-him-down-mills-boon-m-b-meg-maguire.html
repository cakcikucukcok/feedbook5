          &lt;strong&gt;In these two fan-favorite sports romance stories, winning is everything…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making Him Sweat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admitted romantic Jenna Wilinski has just inherited a boxing gym. With it she can finally realize her dream of launching an upscale matchmaking business…provided she can take on the very intimidating–and wickedly hot–boxer who stands in her way! Mercer Rowley vows to protect his &quot;home&quot; from this stubborn, feisty opponent. But man, once the gloves come off, his hands just want to touch her everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking Him Down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matchmaker Lindsey Tuttle always thought Rich Estrada was a whole lot of sexy. He&#39;s a gorgeous, flirty mixed martial arts fighter–what&#39;s not to lust after? When they find themselves heating up during a make-out session, Lindsey is ready for him…ntil Rich abruptly ends it. A year later, Rich is back in Boston recovering from an injury. Lindsey figures it&#39;s the perfect time for a rematch to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
