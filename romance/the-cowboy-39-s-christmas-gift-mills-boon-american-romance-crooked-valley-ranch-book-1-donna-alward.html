      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A CHRISTMAS AFFAIR?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Returning to Crooked Valley is more terrifying than the battlefield to ex-soldier Duke Duggan. Still, Duke has an important reason to be back–to take control of his late grandfather&#39;s ranch. But being thrown headfirst into his old life makes Duke feel like a fish out of water. That is, until he sees Carrie Coulter again. Twenty years may have passed but the chemistry between them is stronger than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Duke threatens to sell the ranch, Carrie, the foreman, realizes she could lose her livelihood. But no decisions will be made until after the holidays. Until then, they have time to explore the feelings that draw them to each other. Together, can they come up with a way to keep the ranch…and the burning love between them?&lt;/p&gt;
