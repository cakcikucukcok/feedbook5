  <title>Love’S Altar - Khan Khattak, Noor Ali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;	Beltun grew up to be an interesting and handsome young man. Young girls frequently discussed him at every gathering, wedding parties and at the gudher - a rushing brook wherefrom the village folk obtained drinking water. He fell in love with Zarmina a handsome girl known as classical beauty of the town. They had clandestine meetings with each other at the gudher and their love grew stronger. Once Beltun erupted in her house in the dead of night and on the roof they exchanged gifts  a hankie and a ring as traditional proofs of their respective feelings of love. At the time of parting, Beltun jumped and banged into the street where the street dogs fell upon him and tore into pieces the hankie  his only souvenir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Beltun joined army service to defend mother land and after completing preliminary training came home on privileged leave to seek Zarminas hand in marriage but her father  Ajab Khan rejected the proposal. Beltun deserted army service. Both him and Zarmina rebelled against the family traditions of marriage and eloped to an unknown destination. It was a death blow to Ajab Khan and his family and they pledged to avenge the family honour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	 The couple found employment under a tribal chief. Beltun became a forest guard and Zarmina a dairy maid. After one month of living together their love consummated and Zarmina got pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	 Maimuna died out of grief after Beltuns desertion from army service and subsequent elopement with Zarmina. Beltun came to attend his mothers funeral felt alone and pensive after his mother died. He sang pensive ballads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When is non around me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sense you are with me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thy thoughts loyal than thee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only they stay with me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need of daggers mum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parting surely kills me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ajab Khan and his men sat Beltuns way on his return journey to his work place and killed  him in a fatal fight which lasted for an hour. They took away his rifle and sword as signs of victory and revenge leaving the dead body and the horse on the scene. His body came home.  Zarghun seeing his sons body fell to the ground and never rose to life again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Zarmina came to attend her husbands funeral and lost all she held dear. It was no less than a dooms day for Maltun and Zarmina when two bodies were taken on stretchers to be buried in the village graveyard with a huge crowd of mourners. After two months time Sherin was born.  Zarmina after six months of Sherins birth married Maltun her brother-in-law and started over again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Fast paced and unexpected tale of tragic romance may be of some appeal to anyone who has ever lost early matrimonial life and romance. &lt;/p&gt;" />
