  <title>Sworn to Protect - Diana Gardin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A sensual, action-filled page-turner that evokes waves of emotion....The sexual tension is thick enough to stop bullets.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;  To keep her safe, he&#39;ll have to uncover all her secrets...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Rayne Alexander. A face I never thought I&#39;d see again, and one I never could forget. Nine years ago, she left town--and me--without a backward glance. But now she&#39;s back, with a haunted look in her eyes and a feisty attitude that didn&#39;t exist when we were teenagers. Seeing this grown-up--and sexy--Rayne is something I wasn&#39;t prepared for... and it&#39;s bringing up feelings I&#39;d thought I&#39;d buried years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Although I want to demand answers from Rayne, working on black ops at Night Eagle Security has taught me that it&#39;s sometimes better to keep my mouth shut. So when I catch her hiding a photo of a little boy, I&#39;m curious. When I see her jump as her phone rings, I&#39;m concerned. But the second I notice a car following her home, I know she&#39;s hiding something. Something dangerous. And while I may not know why she left or why she&#39;s back, if there&#39;s someone out there Rayne is afraid of, I&#39;ll make damn sure that threat is eliminated." />
