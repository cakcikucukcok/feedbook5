      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Army brat Kaydee Wagner gets twitchy if she stays in one place for too long. But when her grandfather needs someone to stay with him for a bit and his home needs a lot of repairs, she steps up to the plate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucky for her, help arrives from their neighbor&#39;s gorgeous grandson, former Army Ranger Leo Reed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leo&#39;s desperate to rise above his dark past and enjoy life again. He&#39;s already made a lot of progress, so when the woman he can&#39;t stop thinking about needs a handyman, he volunteers. But after a very...wet incident involving deadly dance moves and a wayward sink hose, their clothes hit the floor faster than a stack of tile. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He doesn&#39;t want forever--that would mean revealing his past, which he&#39;s not ready to do. She only wants right now, because any other option would require sticking around. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then Kaydee discovers she&#39;s pregnant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Men of at Ease Ranch series is STANDALONE: &lt;br&gt;* In a Ranger&#39;s Arms&lt;br&gt;* Her Secret Ranger&lt;br&gt;* The Right Ranger&lt;br&gt;* Army Ranger with Benefits&lt;br&gt;* The Army Ranger&#39;s Surprise&lt;/p&gt;" />
