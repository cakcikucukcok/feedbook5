  <title>Alien Honey - V.J. Head</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In her first week aboard the Starship Dominance, the shy and inexperienced Cadet Jevorah finds herself in a series of deeply humiliating situations. As she struggles to come to terms with the lack of privacy on board, an attempt to save an alien&amp;#39;s life changes her forever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The end of Jevorah&amp;rsquo;s shift came, and the dreaded moment of discipline was upon her. She had no idea what to expect apart from the Intergalactic Navy&amp;rsquo;s regulations on discipline. There were only two regulations: first, punishment should be appropriate to the misdemeanor; and second, punishment must hurt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As she entered the Security room, she was surprised to be confronted by the whole security detail standing in a group. They looked really annoyed; after all, they were having to stay late past the end of their shift for this, and nobody ever wants that. She turned red and looked at the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Cadet Jevorah!&amp;rdquo; barked Commander Benjamin. Instinctively, she stood sharply to attention.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sir, yes Sir!&amp;rdquo; she shouted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You have wasted your team&amp;rsquo;s time today. You wasted it this morning by turning up late, and you&amp;rsquo;re wasting it now by making them all stay for your punishment. You really are a selfish little brat aren&amp;rsquo;t you? You think you&amp;rsquo;re the centre of the galaxy do you? You&amp;rsquo;re scum. You&amp;rsquo;re worse than that, you&amp;rsquo;re filth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sir, I...&amp;rdquo; she began, choking back tears.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;DON&amp;rsquo;T YOU DARE ANSWER BACK.&amp;rdquo; The commander bellowed right in her face, then he turned and walked a couple of paces away from her, quietly continuing to speak. &amp;ldquo;You have infringed Regulation 587, and you are here to be punished. Remove your uniform.&amp;rdquo;" />
