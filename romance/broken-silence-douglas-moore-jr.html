  <title>Broken Silence - Douglas Moore Jr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;Dougs third book of poetry &lt;i&gt;Broken Silence&lt;/i&gt; is his trilogy of poetry, in which he returns to his roots of what inspired him to write. This collection of poems focuses on romance, heartbreak, family, motivation and dealing with the struggles that a person may encounter in life. The poems convey his feelings about how important loved ones are with the dedication poem to his mother, &lt;i&gt;First Lady&lt;/i&gt;. The poem &lt;i&gt;In Memory of You&lt;/i&gt;, was written for his Grandmother he lost to cancer.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Doug discusses the joys of love and finding that connection with a person in his heartfelt poems &lt;i&gt;Notice You&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Falling For You&lt;/i&gt;. He also addresses the pain of losing a relationship in his poems &lt;i&gt;I Remember When&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Off The Market&lt;/i&gt;, where sometimes putting your heart on the line does not guarantee,a person will end up with the result that was being sought out. In addition, his poem &lt;i&gt;U.G.L.Y.&lt;/i&gt; inspires people that no matter what the opinion others may have of a person, there is strength to overcome any insecurity to find the path of secure inner happiness. The poem &lt;i&gt;In My World&lt;/i&gt; addresses the struggles and pains that he views others dealing with in terms of unemployment and how it is affecting the world.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Dougs purpose in writing this book is to share his thoughts in a poetic form so others can see that no one is ever alone in feeling like the only outcast in the world. We are all unique in our own special way, and live every day as you are painting the world with your vision for everyone to see. &lt;i&gt;Broken Silence&lt;/i&gt; will stimulate a persons mind and show that most valuable things in life primarily come from within and understanding others.&lt;/br&gt;" />
