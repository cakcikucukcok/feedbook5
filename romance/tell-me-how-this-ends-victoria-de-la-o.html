  <title>Tell Me How This Ends - Victoria De La O</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brothers Jude and Ryan McAllister are inseparable. When Jude stepped in to raise Ryan after the death of their mother, it became the two of them against the world. But the scars it left were bone-deep. Then Lizzie Price comes along. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lizzie hopes Ryan&#39;s kindness can help heal her wounds from a toxic relationship. But when she meets Jude, their powerful attraction makes him difficult to resist. The problem is, Lizzie doesn&#39;t realize Jude and Ryan are brothers, and they don&#39;t know they&#39;re falling for the same girl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the truth comes out, everyone is in too deep. Ryan is in love, Jude is in denial, and Lizzie wants both brothers. All of them agree that no one deserves to get hurt. But love and desire have a way of testing even the strongest bonds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
