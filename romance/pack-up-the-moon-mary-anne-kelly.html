  <title>Pack Up the Moon - Mary Anne Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After five extraordinarily moving mysteries, Mary Anne Kelly turns to a touching and charming novel filled with true-to-life characters and deep emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start, Claire Breslinsky is in Munich working as a model. She rents a room in a large apartment and meets a series of magical people---or so they seem to her. Isolde, her landlady and sister model, introduces her to a number of people, including Germany&#39;s leading movie star, a noted film photographer, a doctor whose popularity with the opposite sex matches his medical skills, and many more. It&#39;s a dream for Claire, who fled her home in Queens because of its constant reminders of her cop brother&#39;s death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a wine-soaked dinner party in Isolde&#39;s flat, it is noisily agreed that the odd assortment of friends will drive a string of caravans to India, taking photographs and filming along the way for a documentary that will eventually pay for the trip.  And so the trek begins--during which Claire learns a good bit about India and a great deal more about men, women, and the voyages of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Anne Kelly has been praised for bringing her characters to life. It&#39;s a skill that she uses to tremendous advantage in this wonderful new adventure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
