          &lt;strong&gt;Mistaken Mistress &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Joshua Saxon, the arrogant millionaire who ran New Zealand’s premier winery, believed Alyssa had been his late brother’s mistress. But the true connection between her and the Saxons was even more shocking. From the moment they met, both Alyssa and Joshua had been shaken by passion. But so many secrets and lies were between them…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; Spaniard’s Seduction&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The desire for revenge had driven Rafaelo, Marqués de Las Carreras, for years and now the ruthless Spanish aristocrat had come to New Zealand. Seducing Caitlyn Ross, the Saxons’ beautiful young winemaker, was the perfect way to get what he wanted. But as he came to know this woman, to taste her beguiling blend of inocencia and pasión, he wondered if he was the one being seduced…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Pregnancy Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His late brother’s fiancée was pregnant with a Saxon heir and she thought she could just leave town? Not even Heath Saxon, the black sheep of the mighty Saxons, would allow that. So he propositioned Amy: avoid illegitimacy for her baby by marrying him. Convincing her wasn’t easy; until he showed her what a night as his wife would be like.&lt;/p&gt;
