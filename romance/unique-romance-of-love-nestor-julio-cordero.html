  <title>Unique Romance of Love - Nestor Julio Cordero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All my years through high school I used to see how everyone argues about how love should be and how they blame others for everything they do. I started to analyze everyone though including mine. I started analyzing why we feel this way when falling in love. Why every time we are in a relationship with someone we end up blaming that particular person instead of looking at our self. So I decided to write about how love should be shown, how we need to look at each other before referring to others in any way. We need to start looking deep inside and think about what we really want. We all need to really stop choosing and start to look for who really deserve us through our heart not our mind. Everything might seem confusing at first but if you think it through it really isnt. It is better taking your time eating a meal than rushing and ending up having bad day. What I am referring is to take our time to learn about others, take our time to see beyond that person, take our time to feel what the other person is feeling instead of blocking their heart. It is easy to run away but what youre really doing is just ignoring what can be confronted and taken care of. If love was as simple as a blink of an eye the world would have no sense of living a simple life. I hope you all enjoy my poetry and have a better understanding of what is to love and deserve your present sight.&lt;/p&gt;" />
