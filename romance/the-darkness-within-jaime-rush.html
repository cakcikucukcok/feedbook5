  <title>The Darkness Within - Jaime Rush</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tucker has always known he was different. But he&#39;s learned to control the Darkness within him, to keep his inner wolf at bay, as long as he doesn&#39;t fall in love. And that shouldn&#39;t be a problem because he hasn&#39;t seen his one true love since he was a teenager. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Del needs help, desperately. And the only person she can rely on happens to be the one man she knows she shouldn&#39;t seek out. Tucker&#39;s fierce protective instincts have scared her before, but she has to take the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that they&#39;re reunited, the love they struggled so long to forget rushes back stronger than ever. The temptation to give in is high, but it could cost them everything. And when Tucker&#39;s wolf is unleashed, will they be able to save themselves? &lt;/p&gt;" />
