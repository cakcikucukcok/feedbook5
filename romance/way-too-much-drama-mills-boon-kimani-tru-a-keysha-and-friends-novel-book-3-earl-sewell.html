  <title>Way Too Much Drama (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani Tru) (A Keysha and Friends Novel, Book 3) - Earl Sewell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The toughest lessons aren’t always taught in the classroom…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maya is ready to put the fabulous back into her life—and that means getting her manipulative cousin, Viviana, out of it. Bad enough that Viviana is living under the same roof and tried to claim Maya’s boyfriend Misalo for herself. Now she’s going to Maya’s high school and she’s part of the quiz team competing on a TV show…alongside Maya, Keysha, and Misalo. Maya’s got no sympathy when Viviana finally starts to feel the pressure of fitting into her new world. That’s until her cousin does something drastic…and dangerous. Maybe Viviana isn’t as tough as everyone thought. Maya could be the only person who can help bring her back safely. Question is…does she want to?&lt;/p&gt;
