          &lt;strong&gt;Father, Meet Son.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Safe Harbor obstetrician Adrienne Cavill couldn’t love her nephew more if he were her own child. And no deadbeat dad is going to claim the little boy she practically raised and plans to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wade Hunter’s past—and future—awaits the detective-turned-PI in his California home town. He missed five years of his son’s life and nothing’s chasing him away this time. That includes the pretty doctor who’s giving his child everything—except the father he needs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now that she knows the reasons why he left, how can Adrienne keep Wade from his son, who’s over the moon about having his dad in his life? The rugged ex-cop’s having a similar effect on her. Will Christmas bring Adrienne the family she never thought she could have?&lt;/p&gt;
