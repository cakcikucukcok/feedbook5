  <title>When Summer Comes (Whiskey Creek, Book 3) - Brenda Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Whiskey Creek—heart of the gold country! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One day, Callie Vanetta receives devastating news… She needs a liver transplant. But her doctors warn that, in her case, the chances of finding a compatible donor aren’t good. Determined to spend whatever time she has left on her own terms, she keeps the diagnosis to herself and moves out to her late grandparents’ farm.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She’s always wanted to live there. But the farm hasn’t been worked in years and she begins to fear she can’t manage it, that she’ll have to return to town. One night, a stranger comes knocking at her door…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He’s an attractive and mysterious drifter by the name of Levi McCloud, and he offers to trade work for a few nights’ shelter. Callie figures she doesn’t have anything to lose. He needs a place to stay until he can fix his motorcycle; she needs an extra pair of hands.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The arrangement seems ideal until what was supposed to be temporary starts to look more and more permanent. Then she realizes she does have something to lose—her heart. And although he doesn’t yet know it, Levi stands to lose even more.&lt;/p&gt;
