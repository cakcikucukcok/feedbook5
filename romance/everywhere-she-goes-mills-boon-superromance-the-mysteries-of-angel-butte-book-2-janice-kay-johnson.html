        &lt;p&gt;Standing between her…and danger&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Returning to her hometown is Cait McAllister’s chance to stand on her own. That means taking a break from men and relationships. Then she meets her new boss, the intriguing Noah Chandler. As the mayor he’s got bold plans for Angel Butte. As a man he’s so tempting Cait’s vow of independence is in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The most persuasive part of him, however, could be the way he looks out for her. Because when a threat from her past puts her in danger, Noah is there to protect her. And there’s no way she can resist a man who has so much invested in keeping her safe.&lt;/p&gt;
