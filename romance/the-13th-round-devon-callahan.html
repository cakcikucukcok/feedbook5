  <title>The 13Th Round - Devon Callahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Retired heavy-weight boxer, Nyza Stevenson had never lost a fight until he met the pretty Nichelle Tammerine Phillips, better known to the world as: Tammerine Loc Phillips, the undisputed female boxing champion. Of course she had never lost a fight either. Both boxers were pretty stubborn by right. 
Tracey, Nyzas life-long friend and former trainer had a secret affair with Arvette, Nyzas older sister. But there was one problem. Zay had one rule and one specific rule only; His friends were not allowed to date his sister.  Tracey wasnt even allowed, even though Tracey, Zay and Arvette grew up together.  No one was good enough for his sister, not even his best friend. 
 Tracey and Arvette were in love and they continued their escapades against Nyzas wishes.  They both had fun but the relationship was later terminated because of the Nyzas disapproval  not to mention Arvette became pregnant by another man. 
Tracey gets over Arvette and decides to move on with his life. Three years later, Tracey gets married to a woman that he doesnt love and Vette returns to the D.C. area to visit her older brother and pay her dues.  She has a secret that she has been keeping from everyone but at the same time Tracey learns that his new bride had sex with his best friend, (Nyza.)  Tammerine, Zays new girlfriend finds out and is furious.  She is ready to walk away from the relationship and everything that she invested in when Zay comes to find that his new love interest (Tammerine) has been hiding a few secrets of her own. 
Everything comes out right in the middle of Nyzas living room and it becomes a straight knock down- drag out when everything comes to light in this cool, yet sexy novel.  But the male and the female boxers have issues to hash out within their own relationship.  It turns into an all out fight scheduled for 12 rounds, but the boxers glove up for the thirteenth round...  
Sometimes relationships go into overtime.
Sexy and softly erotic; it is a must read!
