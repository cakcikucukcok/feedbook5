  <title>Highlander Heat - Laureen Hanley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lily, a girl with nothing to lose, is trying to keep up with the men using her. Deciding to turn the tables, she is caught in a web of deceit and a dangerous game she can barely keep up with.
When her friend, Terrie, suggests a weekend of partying and fun, Lily eagerly agrees. But soon after reaching their destination, the girls realize that the weekend of fun is turning into a nightmare from Hell.
As everything starts spiraling out of control, the girls find themselves transported back in time to 1500 Scotland. Captured by men, Lily must learn to trust the one man, Max, a Highlander warrior, who holds the key for them to return back to their own time. 
It doesn&#39;t take Lily long to start falling in love with Max. However, she soon learns that she is not the only one after his heart when she finds herself caught in a cat and mouse game with those around her.
When Lily enters his life, he will go to any lengths to possess her. With Max&#39;s ever looming hand-fast approaching will he be willing to defy his family and clan to keep her? Or will she just become another trophy in a long line of conquests. 
With all the odds against her, will Lily be able to win the heart of her Highlander, or will the game she&#39;s been trying to keep up with destroy her and her heart for good?" />
