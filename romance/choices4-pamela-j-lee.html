  <title>Choices4 - Pamela J Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the beginning, God said, Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness Genesis 1:26, (KJV). From that man, He took a rib and made woman. Man was appointed the head of that woman; to be her leader, provider, and protector. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be one flesh. Genesis 2:23-24 (KJV). And so it was. 
Fast forward to the new millennium; an ever changing world that is technologically overloaded and morally deficient. Somewhere, in the divine scheme of things, the roles of the man and woman became blurred. Mans world got turned upside down and the woman found herself walking in a brand new set of shoes. Not that she asked for those shoes, but rather, she was forced to wear them. Her new role came with significant changes in the game plan. 
Choices4: Act Like A Lady, Think Like A Woman explores the lives of three different women and the choices they faced adjusting to those changes. Their choices are presented here before the court of life for cross examination. What will the verdict be? You be the jury." />
