          &lt;em&gt;Get swept up in a rancher&#39;s struggle to heal his son and a caring woman&#39;s need to belong. A special bond, a special family…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When widower Hunter Coltrane learned that his adopted son, Johnny, had a rare blood disease, he enlisted the aid of The Children&#39;s Connection in finding the boy&#39;s biological family. Hunter&#39;s search came to a dead end…until he met Terese, a shy beauty who answered his prayers and breathed new life into his shattered soul.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Warm and loving, Terese Warwick had been mistreated by men. But Hunter seemed different. He was strong, gentle and made her feel beautiful. And she loved feeling that she belonged to a family, as she did with Hunter and Johnny…but could she heal this man&#39;s wounded heart and teach him to love again?&lt;/p&gt;
