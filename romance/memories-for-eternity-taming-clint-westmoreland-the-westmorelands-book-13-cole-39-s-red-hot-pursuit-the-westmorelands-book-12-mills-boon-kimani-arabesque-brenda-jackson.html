  <title>Memories for Eternity: Taming Clint Westmoreland (The Westmorelands, Book 13) / Cole&#39;s Red-Hot Pursuit (The Westmorelands, Book 12) (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani Arabesque) - Brenda Jackson</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Two classic Westmoreland novels from New York Times bestselling author Brenda Jackson&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;TAMING CLINT WESTMORELAND &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In name only? The moment ex-Texas Ranger Clint Westmoreland learns that he is still married, he sets the limits for his wife&#39;s stay at his exclusive horse ranch. But when she arrives, Clint&#39;s boundaries began to blur. He and Alyssa Barkley have thirty days to untangle the legal knot that bound them together during an undercover assignment years before. But this sexy, curvaceous Alyssa is different from the mousy, awestruck rookie agent he remembers. And now her every move has him wondering what it would be like if he really was her man….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;COLE&#39;S RED-HOT PURSUIT &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cole Westmoreland always gets what he wants! What the former Texas Ranger wants is sultry Patrina Forman. But Patrina is dead set against falling for a man with a no-strings-attached attitude, and there is no way she is going to fall into bed with a lawman! Then a Montana blizzard changes everything. Trapped together for three sinfully delicious nights, Cole soon has Patrina singing a different tune thanks to his personal brand of red-hot seduction. But what will happen once the snow begins thaw?&lt;/p&gt;
