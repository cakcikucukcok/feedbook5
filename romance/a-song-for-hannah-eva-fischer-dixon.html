  <title>A Song for Hannah - Eva Fischer-Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When sixteen year old Rachel Schwartz meet a young sailor, Andy Russell, no one would expect, especially her parents that their love-at-first-sight would last. Rachel faithfully waited for his return from his extended submarine duty and a year later, after his return, Andy proposed marriage. Parents on both sides agreed that their children&#39;s love for each other was genuine, but Rachel being Jewish and Andy being Catholic seemed like an obstacle that Andy was willing to bridge by converting.
	Rachel anxiously waited for Andy&#39;s decision about their wedding day that kept getting further, delayed for various reasons, new civilian job, conversion, money issues and then the unbelievable happens, Andy commits the ultimate betrayal. Rachel becomes devastated by the break-up but in an attempt to seek revenge, she seduces one of Andy&#39;s brothers and she had to face the unexpected consequences of her action.
	After losing faith and trust in men, Rachel concentrates on her career after moving to California. Because of a strange string of events, she travels to Israel where she encounters a man, Yossi, who would give her another chance for happiness, but only if Rachel is able to put the past behind her. While she is trying to make the decision about her future, first she must face a devastating event that she is not sure that she is able to overcome.  With the help of Yossi, Rachel puts her life back together and makes the ultimate decision that affects everyone around her." />
