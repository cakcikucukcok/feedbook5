            &lt;em&gt;FIVE YEARS TOO LATE….&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She should have been mine,&lt;/em&gt; Victoria Ketchum thought as she cradled Jess Hasting&#39;s daughter. Instead, Victoria had turned from Jess, and he&#39;d married another. Now a widowed single father, the lean, rugged deputy sheriff could still make her passion rise–but the bitterness of their breakup kept them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now Jess saw Victoria strictly as his daughter&#39;s doctor. And Victoria needed Jess&#39;s lawman skills when a body was found on her family&#39;s ranch. Yet, working together to care for his sick little girl, and to investigate the murder, made them remember just how good it had been between them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And how good it could still be…&lt;/p&gt;
