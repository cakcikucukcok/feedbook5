  <title>Wake up to the Dawn - Lee Pitts, Ron Beach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the Mexican-Arizona border two US border agents are murdered as they try to stop drugs from entering the country; in a convenience store parking lot in Las Vegas, Nevada, the wife of a private investigator is seriously wounded while sitting in her car waiting for her husband to buy milk to their baby; again in Nevada a father seeks help in freeing his daughter from the clutches of a drug lord; in Honolulu, Hawaii a family walks on the beach and discovers a vial of heroin washed ashore on the white sands, forever tainting their home in paradise.  Seemingly the incidents are unrelated, yet they are enough alike to draw the Broken Dreams Detective Agency into the middle of a bloody, gang-related drug war.  From the kidnapping and drugging of a Broken Dreams undercover agent, to the waylaying of a load of drugs intended for distribution in Las Vegas, to a tender love story, Broken Dreams finds their agency fighting four gangs who are waging war against each other to determine who will be the drug king in the greater Las Vegas valley.  Watch out druggies, Broken Dreams is your worst nightmare." />
