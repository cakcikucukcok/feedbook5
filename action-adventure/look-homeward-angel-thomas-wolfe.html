  <title>Look Homeward, Angel - Thomas Wolfe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Thomas Clayton Wolfe&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;(October 3, 1900 &amp;ndash; September 15, 1938) was an American&amp;nbsp;novelist&amp;nbsp;of the early twentieth century.&lt;br /&gt;
Wolfe wrote four lengthy novels, plus many short stories, dramatic works, and novellas. He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, vividly reflect on American culture and the&amp;nbsp;mores&amp;nbsp;of that period, albeit filtered through Wolfe&amp;#39;s sensitive, sophisticated, and hyper-analytical perspective. He became widely known during his own lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;
After Wolfe&amp;#39;s death, his contemporary&amp;nbsp;William Faulkner&amp;nbsp;said that Wolfe may have had the best talent of their generation. Wolfe&amp;#39;s influence extends to the writings of&amp;nbsp;beat generation&amp;nbsp;writer&amp;nbsp;Jack Kerouac, and of authors&amp;nbsp;Ray Bradbury&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Philip Roth, among others. He remains an important writer in modern&amp;nbsp;American literature, as one of the first masters of&amp;nbsp;autobiographical fiction, and is considered North Carolina&amp;#39;s most famous writer." />
