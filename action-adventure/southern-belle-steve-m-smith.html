  <title>Southern Belle - Steve M. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For computer programmer Mike Braker it had been a bad year. With his wife gone and his drinking problem getting worse, all he wanted to do was hide from his problems. Running away was all he had done throughout his life. Mike Brakers year was going to get a whole lot worse. He was about to come up against a problem from which there would be no hiding. He was about to meet Sean Crane. 
&lt;p&gt;Crane was cool, meticulous and unrelenting in his ruthlessness. It was these qualities that over the years had made him a top assassin, but as the years took their toll his nerves were beginning to show. When Braker starts to uncover an intricate computer fraud, he is pitted against Cranes professional skills. Their battle begins in Spain, continues in England, New Orleans and Orlando reaching its climax in New York at the height of the Independence Day fireworks display. With $7.5 million diverted to a hidden account, the line between hunter and hunted becomes blurred. The ultimate race against time to halt a multiple assassination and expose the fraud holds an intriguing triple-twist ending that is sure to keep the pages turning." />
