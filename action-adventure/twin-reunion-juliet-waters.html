  <title>Twin Reunion - Juliet Waters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;Stacey Brown is what youd call average-she goes to a regular school; she has a regular mom, and has had a regular life. Stacey is a straight-A student who always solves problems quickly and everything is a breeze. She isnt exceptional or weird-shes normal-and she likes it that way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Scarlet came. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staceys life is turned upside down. Suddenly, mysterious events begin to happen. She forms a club to solve the mysteries-a club that would explain why Staceys neighbor was poisoned and why a classmate just happened to be standing on a trapdoor that wasnt supposed to be there. She feels that now shes doing something daring-but the worst is yet to come. The mystery gets stranger as their new, fishy friend is growing distant from the two; her mom herself is behaving unnaturally, and their teacher quits. Everything is connected, she knows, and starts a journey to figure out the mystery-this is one problem that she has to solve. Stacey takes matters into her own hands-but ends up getting a little more than she bargained for-the truth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stacey Brown is no longer Stacey Brown. Her life has been a lie.&lt;/div&gt;" />
