&lt;P align=center&gt;Brief Teaser Summery about the book&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;B&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Faxon Branson&lt;/B&gt; - Happenings happened in the life of this handsome young man putting his loyalty to test against charming women who invaded his life at various stages. He had no option but to emerge unscathed to save his marriage. Could he manage the challenge or &lt;I&gt;It Just Happened&lt;/I&gt;as it would have.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;B&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Lubna Martin -&lt;/B&gt; The beautiful wife of Faxon believed in him, in his love and devotion for her. But how could she deceive her own heart with what she saw with her own eyes on a quiet lonely afternoon when &lt;I&gt;It Just Happened&lt;/I&gt;with Faxon at the Valois Mansion.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;B&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Rebecca Valois -&lt;/B&gt; The show stopper 42 years old lonely beautiful spinster heiress of the multi-billion dollar Valois Business Empire regretted her decision to remain single after attending the marriage of Faxon and Lubna. Luckily for her, &lt;I&gt;It Just Happened&lt;/I&gt;that Faxon, the intelligent and handsome General Manager, worked in her organization.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;B&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Gonza - &lt;/B&gt;The young and growing tribal beauty of a forgotten tiny island in the Atlantic Ocean. Its natives had never heard about marriage. When she found a man - Faxon Branson, lying unconscious and injured on the sea shore &lt;I&gt;It Just Happened&lt;/I&gt;in her tranquil life too. She didn&#39;t know how to cope with the sensual turmoil that followed. She couldn&#39;t help giving it a shot. And what a shot it was!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Faxon and his college time friend Lubna hoped to live a cozy married life, but his billionaire boss Rebecca, smitten for Faxon&#39;s love, swallowed pills when he refused her covert advances. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Was death of love ordained in Faxon&#39;s married life? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Dejection made him board a ship. Fortunately, the shipwreck landed him on an unknown island. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Wonderful men do wonders anywhere; &lt;I&gt;It Just Happened&lt;/I&gt;on the island too.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;I&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;A scintillating &lt;B&gt;compulsive page-turner&lt;/B&gt; saga of aristocracy,&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;intimacy, suspense and adventure&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
