  <title>The Eagles&#39; Cry - Gracie Pearl Mahoney, Willa Charlene Nowell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Eagles Cry is set in Oklahoma in 1950 after decades of events that have tested the fiber of family and community strength; The Dust Bowl, the Great Depression, and World War II.  As a community emerges still intact from these external adversities, they discover that an internal malevolence may be their downfall.  A murderer has suddenly started killing women and children in the particularly unworldly, small town of Bugtussel.  People are afraid for their families, and afraid of one another, as the only outside suspects in the case, the hobos, have spread the word to avoid Bugtussel.  Now a community must look within to see who among them is trying to tear them apart.

Book Excerpt
Granpa Shares a Vision
	Gracie had awakened suddenly.  She heard the front screen groan as Granpa opened and closed it.  She heard the creek of protest from the porch as he let himself down on his favorite spot just to the right of the steps.  She climbed out of bed trying not to wake Willie, but before she could slip her dress over her head and get out the door, Willie was beside her.  They came as quietly as they could through the protesting front screen and silently crept into Granpas lap.
	Listen, he whispered.  Watch.
	The eastern light turned crimson as the world became brighter around them.  The rooster dutifully announced the beginning of another day.  The chickens emerged clucking, milling around, scratching for the early worm, and occasionally fighting over it.
	Willie wriggled to get a more comfortable position.  Gracie held her breath.  Something about Granpa told her this was very important to her.
	Look.  It was almost a sigh.
	The girls gaze followed Granpas pointing finger to the sky.  They saw a small, dark spot on the horizon, appearing as if by signal from Granpa.  Soon a great bird came closer.  As it grew near, another approached.
	They are high, high, Gracie thought.  Then she heard a cry from the first; an answering cry from the other.  The clearness, the sharpness of the call touched something deep inside her.  She heard Willies sigh of awe.
	Thats the eagle, Granpa said.
	The eagles circled, calling to each other.  One came close and rose again with a cry.  Gracie was lost in them.  She felt their freedom and joy burst in her heart.  She cried from joy.  Willie held tighter to Granpa.  The chicken noises faded away and the three of them were lost in the eagles.  The three were eagles.  They were flying in the heavens calling to each other recognition as they passed.  Granpa held them close, his love like a warm comforter.
	When your father died, he said, I had a time of anguish and bitterness.  I couldnt seem to get out of the darkness around me.
	Then, Jesus gave me a vision.  I saw ice-topped mountains, with several eagles flyin amongst them.  Each time one would pass the other, they would cry in recognition to each other.  They flew high above the earth, tangled in nothin; their eyes on heaven.
	Granpa was quiet for awhile, then he said with compassion, Without the joy of the Lord, life is like them chickens over there.  Heads close to the ground, peckin out a livin, fightin over the earth worm.  I was like that rooster, risin early in the mornin and gettin lost in the earth and scratchin.  Sadness was there for a moment.
Then, he finished, I learned some things you jist had to turn over to the Lord, and fly with the eagles.
	They both hugged Granpa close.
