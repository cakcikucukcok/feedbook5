      <meta name="description" content="Drug smugglers have claimed sections of the US-Mexico border as their home turf, turning hundreds of square miles into a no-mans-land for US citizens and a deadly gamut for illegal migrants. A lack of political will has prevented any decisive action to be taken to secure the area. Thats about to change. . .&lt;p&gt;
Returned from Europe after international pressure boiled up over the way they secured the Russian chemical weapons dump, the 289th Engineer Group is sent to an isolated stretch of border in New Mexico to serve out its tour of duty. All they thought they would have to do is fix the fence and upgrade the road, but some in their chain of
command have other ideas. Sergeant Major Grant and his NCOs are to secure the area, with permission to operate secretly in Mexico. What they havent been told is the Mexican officer they are working with also controls the local drug trade, and he has no plans to let the Americans succeed. It will take a dangerous plan to take out the smuggling activity, and a lot of luck to avoid starting a war." />
