  <title>Mistaken - Skylar Ravenwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Over nine years ago, Princess Dulciana came to terms with losing her beloved husband, Prince Concordance. Faced with a necessity to keep her and her daughters identity hidden, she takes on a new identity and settles into the meager daily tasks of a farm maid/slave. With the death of their protector, the women are sold into slavery by his callous son, Michael. Their lives are thrown into a tailspin that forever changes them as the events of the past come back to transform the womens resolve and their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-known tyrant, Zenith, purchases the women for a kings ransom; he is not whom he seems to be, as is many of the things Dulciana and her daughter have come to believe. Zenith and his men are frantically endeavoring to pull the women out of the desert country and back into civilization, where they are free from the lies of the past. An attempt that is proving exhilarating with long hot days in the desert and its freak sandstorms blocking their way back. Michaels actions add aggravation to Zeniths plight of returning the women home and to a future befitting royalty. The first Chronicles of M.&lt;/p&gt;" />
