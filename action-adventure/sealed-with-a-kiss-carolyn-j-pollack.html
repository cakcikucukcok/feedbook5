  <title>Sealed with a Kiss - Carolyn J. Pollack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After the death of her grandmother, Peta Masters moved to the Central Queensland city of Rockhampton where her aim was to open an arts-and-craft shop. She thought her life was complete, but she didnt bargain on a chance encounter with handsome grazier, Beale Jacobs. It is only then that she comes to realize that her biggest adventure is just about to begin. 
Peta and Beale come from different backgrounds. Peta owns and operates an arts-and-craft shop; Beale is a cattleman from Western Queensland, used to working long hours under the harsh Australian sun. 
Beale needs a wife who must provide him with an heir within the first year of their marriage. Peta needs somewhere to live when her business and home is destroyed by fire. 
Can their hasty marriage survive the test of time especially when Beales ex-girlfriend arrives on the scene, determined to cause trouble? Love wasnt supposed to be on their agenda, but it soon finds a place deep in their hearts. Unfortunately, this is a secret that they keep hidden from each other. Jealousy and mistrust threaten to tear them farther apart when a friend of Petas also visits the property that Peta now calls home. 
Will Peta leave the man she has come to love so completely, thinking he loves another woman? Or will she stay to fight this battle of the heart?" />
