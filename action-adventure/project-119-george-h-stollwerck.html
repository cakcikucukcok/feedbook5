  <title>Project 119 - George H. Stollwerck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is October of 2006. The Avian flu continues to visit itself upon Asia. In June of this year, WHO scientists were forced to admit that an Asian family who died of the disease in Late May is proof that H5N1 has mutated, and is now capable of being transmitted human-to-human.
	If that wasnt enough of a threat, former NYPD First Class Detective Edward Augustus Fox, now of the Hong Kong Police who we met last year in the serial homicide case code-named Hongse Spider, returns from a terrorism seminar presented by the FBI Academy in the US, to find Hong Kong under siege.
	Fox, because his work in reducing Hong Kongs burgeoning homicide rate, has been promoted from Homicide Lieutenant to Chief Inspector in-charge of combating all crimes against citizens.
The new threats to Hong Kong consist of unexplained incidents of fatal radiation poisoning; a North Korean nuclear missile being smuggled through the former crown colony into China; armed robberies being pulled to steal Avian flu vaccine; the worlds best counterfeit US$100 bills meant to destabilize the economy being dumped on the streets; and the emergence of a new plot by China to sabotage the 2008 Olympic Summer Games in Beijing, called Project 119." />
