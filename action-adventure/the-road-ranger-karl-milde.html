  <title>The Road Ranger - Karl Milde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meet Tom Smith, the entrepreneur-founder of RoadWheels, a hugely successful company that carries people and their cars from city to city in uniquely designed, double-deck tractor-trailers. While tailing a car that his company brought north from New York City and unloaded at Niagara Falls, a car he believes is smuggling contraband into Canada, Tom is ambushed, knifed and left for dead. An alert Canadian border official, Alonzo Sierra, saves his life by bringing him to a Toronto hospital. During his recovery, Tom decides to feign his own demise and continue his investigation incognito, his true identity known only to the top managers of his company and to Alonzo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wearing silver aviator glasses to mask his face, Tom follows a trail that leads him from New York City to a remote island in the South Pacific. As he gets ever closer to finding his attacker, a vicious killer known as the Enforcer, and the Enforcers boss, an evil woman who leads the smuggling operation, he loses his ownership of RoadWheels and unknowingly enters their deadly trap.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While following the twists and turns of his investigation, Tom meets one person after another who desperately needs his help. He takes time to stop whenever and wherever he finds injustice to protect the innocent and bring the wrongdoers to task. Step by step, Tom finds his true self, and a hero is born. He becomes the Road Ranger, destined to travel the highways with his all-black tractor-trailer and silver motorcycle, accompanied by his young companion, Alonzo, whom he has dubbed Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;" />
