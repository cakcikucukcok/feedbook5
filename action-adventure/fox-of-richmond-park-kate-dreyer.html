  <title>Fox Of Richmond Park - Kate Dreyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When your family home has been demolished by a ruling power terrified of mutiny and the love of your life gives their heart to another, wouldn&#39;t you search the open city for a better future?  This is a story of one Londoner who found himself in this situation. He just happens to have fur and four legs.  With the help of an adventure-seeking magpie, Vince the fox is determined to find his grandparents’ old home, which exists somewhere within England&#39;s capital. The threat of political exile and the city&#39;s modern, mechanical and multicultural challenges will not stop him.  But back in Richmond Park, Edward the alpha-stag is paranoid: if Vince&#39;s departure encourages a multi-species uprising, the deer will lose their power – and Edward is hardly the only tyrannical ruler to be feared in the capital&#39;s parks.  Just what has Vince started beneath the eyeline of London&#39;s human population?" />
