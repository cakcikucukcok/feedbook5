  <title>Coming of Age - Sean Phelan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Maynard and Seamus. Sea and May. Wolfman and Sundance. This is a story that can, May and will change the World!&lt;p&gt; 
This is a story told by a Child full of Silence and Peace. This is a story of two young people driving away from the Rock-like locus of Youth, while still retaining part of Youth&#39;s Golden Vision in their rearview mirrors (and dashboard Sun visor). This is a story that concerns the Search for God and Self, which one finds, at the end of the Odyssey, are All One in the same sacred place. This is a cautionary tale that concerns America&#39;s Sunday-morning&#39;s-everyday-for-all-I-care youths, and their quick, cynical, unfulfilling, and inevitable descent into solipsistic/nihilistic adulthood. This is a story that reminds that Youth (and, perhaps, America) is a bildungsroman that must topple before being reborn. This is a bittersweet, tragic comedy of Transformation, in which the changes in Maynard and Seamus mirror a coming cultural Revolution. This is a story of Truth planted firm - born of Fire, surrounded by Water and spread by Air. This is a story of Jungian, (and near Almagestian), breadth, full of Music and Movement and Love and Faith. This is a story whose Time has come. . . . &lt;p&gt;
