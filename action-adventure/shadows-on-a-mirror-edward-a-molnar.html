  <title>Shadows on a Mirror - Edward A. Molnar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Suppose you had scientific evidence that a soulmeant by God to be eternalexisted in man. Suppose youand only youknew that man had created a form of radiation that not only killed, but destroyed the soul as well. Concerned about mass disillusionment and hysteria, who could you tell? What would you do? Now suppose an Army officer, bent on making general and also fully knowledgeable about the radiation, intends to use it as a weapon. Aided by CIA-like operatives, he will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. When he finds out you share his secret, what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought provoking and controversial, &lt;i&gt;Shadows&lt;/i&gt; is a metaphysical thriller. For protagonist Alex Feher its a dangerous, paradox-defying journey from the mysterious Black Mesa and the intrigue of Los Alamos, New Mexico, to Washington, D. C. and finally to the doors of the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shadows&lt;/i&gt; provides a theoretical but plausible model for the soul, offering rational explanations for phenomena such as ESP, out of body experiences, love at first sight, dj vu sensations, and even reincarnation.  An American Indian version of the soul, based on myth but consistent with the model, helps weave the fabric of the story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
