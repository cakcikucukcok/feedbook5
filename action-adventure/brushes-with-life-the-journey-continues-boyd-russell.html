  <title>Brushes with Life- the Journey Continues - Boyd Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Russel allows the reader to walk next to walk next to Shaun Mckenzie as he continues his journey. That journey is distinguished by candor and unswerving purpose. His boyhood training in the ancient martial art of Bando continually sideswipes contemporary behavior and values. In &quot;Brushes With Life- The Journey Continues&quot; Shaun&#39;s unique approach to problem solving is tested when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He intercedes between a crime boss that befriended him years before and a crooked U.S Attorney trying to convict him of a crime he didn&#39;t commit. The &quot;hornests nest&quot; he stirs up brings friends and enemies from unexpected places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He comes to the aid of the daughter of a college sweetheart. Jean is in jeopardy of losing the company her Mother founded to a devious and abusive competitor. Shaun&#39;s closest friend John agrees to intercede in place of Shaun. John&#39;s unconventional approach to business hardball produces interesting results for Jean and a business spanking for the outclassed competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tragic death of his wife, Mickey, at the hands of a drunk driver causes his face to face encounter with the &quot;injustice&quot; in the &quot;justice&quot; system. Her loss, Shaun&#39;s fundamental respect for all life, and this encounter force him to question his basic foundation. The outcome brings devastating results.&lt;/p&gt;
