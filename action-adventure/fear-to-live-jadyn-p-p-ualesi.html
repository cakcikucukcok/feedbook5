But Zekiah was still playing hard to get around him. Little did they know, trouble was around them again, and they both knew they needed each other. When Zekiahs grandmother died in her sleep at Jeremiahs place, she was heartbroken, knowing that the person she loved sharing her thoughts to and adored so much was gone. But Jaron fought his way to her heart to be with her as she grieved for her grandmothers death. But Jadens name has been heard again, and hes back to ruin them both. Jaron knew just what to do to get rid of him again so that he could be with the love of his life again, Zekiah Wonder. Will they be able to get through their problems together, or will they have to lean on themselves to work it out?" />
