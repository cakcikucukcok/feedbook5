THE CALL
	The big clock in the hall showed that is was 1:59 p.m. as I opened the door.  Damn, Im good, I thought, always on time.
	What the hell happened to you, Officer Randel? asked Undersheriff Collins.
	Oh, just a little car-jacking on the way over; the SOB shot my partner in the chest.  Looking at my uniform, I observed that I was muddy and wet past my knees, my bloody shirt was ripped at the shoulder and at the elbow on my left arm, and I definitely was not squared away.
	Sheriff Morgan queried, Did you kill the bastard? 
Frank-3 Enroute!
Rookie Gilmore was trying to hold off Miss La Fleur, whom he was arresting for prostitution when Lt. (Benedict) Arnold criticized him for his behavior.  Arnold stated, Ill escort her to jail personally. 
	I commented, Arnold thinks Miss La Fleurs one hot dancin mama; even put her in the front seat.  Ive seen that look in his eyes before.  Hes in for a big surprise.  Ha, ha, ha!
	I asked, Where the hell is Willy?
	About that time, I heard, Can I get some help in here, ple.a.se?
	Officer Roscoe, who was cuffing Kat, jumped from the pile and ran to the bathroom.  Willy, with his gun pointed toward a whore, had her backed up and standing in the bathtub.  In her hand was an ice pick.  Willy was trying to cajole her into dropping it.
	The whore touted, I aint goin back to jail, pigs!
By the way Officer Randel, said Gramms, one of the street people, that anti-freeze (wink-wink) that you gave us sure kept us warm when it rained.  Thanks!  Its strange how the streets have a beat and a life of their own.
	I visited Jasper Boy Murdock at Indian Springs Penitentiary.  I could give you information about whos killing all those women if you could get me off on good behavior, coerced Jasper.
	Cant do that, Boy!
Control, Frank-3 Enroute to UMC with a young, blond female who needs immediate attention.  I have Sister Roscoe with me.  My mileage is 10142.1.
Cheri answered, Father Randel?  Did you say Sister Roscoe?
Thats affirmative.  Switch to five  I thought, we need to clean up the drug dealers along with the prostitutes.  Ive got to call the captain.
