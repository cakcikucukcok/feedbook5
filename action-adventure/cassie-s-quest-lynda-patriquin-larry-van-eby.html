  <title>Cassie’S Quest - Lynda Patriquin, Larry Van Eby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cassie is a foster child of the state of California.  She has been in many foster homes; some good and some bad.  She is going to another one.  This foster is one of the better ones and she is about to embark on the greatest adventure of her young life.
Cassie is sleeping in her room in the attic, when she is awakened by the rain.  As she looks out her window, she sees a mysterious light, floating in the hills.  She should have kept this secret to herself.  Instead, it takes her on a journey of danger and intrigue as she and Cole witness a crime, deep in the canyon floor.  Without the help of Cole&#39;s horse, Bolero, the creature would have surely died." />
