  <title>Bernie Weber and the Riemann Hypothesis - Matthew Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Milwaukeeans are a very particular group of people. They are inherently tactless and naturally suspicious. They don&#39;t believe in nuance. They don&#39;t believe in &quot;going easy&quot; on someone. So when Chinese spies invade their city, they sure as hell aren&#39;t going to take it lying down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this hilarious thriller by lawyer and politician (but don&#39;t hold that against him) Matthew Flynn, the CIA and the Chinese Ministry of Intelligence go head to head in the battle for Bernie Weber, an unassuming college student who just happens to be a mathematics genius. The secret to cracking China&#39;s encryptions lies in his proof for the Riemann Hypothesis, and the Chinese fear he could take down all of their operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Bernie isn&#39;t alone. He has CIA agent Audrey Knapp on his side. Will that be enough to outwit China&#39;s best agents?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flynn gives you a glimpse of the inner workings of Milwaukee in this love letter to his home city and brilliant send-up of espionage thrillers. Everything from Milwaukee culture to Governor Scott Walker is fair game for Flynn&#39;s wit. The escapades of Bernie and Audrey may be fictional, but Flynn captures the true heart of the city and its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;" />
