  <title>The Twilight of Liberty - S. Keith Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate is 10 percent. Taxes consume a huge portion of the working peoples paychecks. Corruption dominates every level of the Government. The highest levels seek to turn control of the country over to the United Nations through the creation of a National Police force of the power-hungry Homeland Security, and it strips basic rights from the populace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David, an automotive technician, is a family man whose life seems to get worse by the day when he is placed in prison for a crime he did not commit. James is a Petty Officer on the aircraft carrier USS Jefferson. He longs for his childhood home in Alaska when times were more laidback and peaceful. His life becomes complicated when he discovers a spy aboard the ship. Benjamin, a divorced man with grown children, has been stockpiling supplies in an underground bunker in his home in Alaska. He senses something momentous is on the horizon but knows not what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation in the United States worsens beyond imagination, chaos ensues, and the three men race against time to find safety for themselves and their families in a world gone mad.&lt;/p&gt;" />
