Rachel, a former lawyer turned stay-at-home-mom, struggles to make sense of her new life, find a path to happiness, and gain peace of mind.

As Rachel grows in the knowledge of her ancestor, she begins to accept herself. But will learning about the past bring insight to Rachels presentor will the daunting trials she faces get the best of her?
Past, present, and future collide on Rachels journey to understanding." />
