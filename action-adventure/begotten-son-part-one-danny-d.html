  <title>Begotten Son: Part One - Danny D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When his wife dies in childbirth, wealthy Italian merchant Robert Agnoli makes a vow to do everything in his power to ensure their only son, Antonio, has the best in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later, on the final day of World War II, a chance encounter with an orphan girl leads Robert to concoct a detailed and somewhat outlandish plan to ensure that these two motherless children will never want for anything again as long as they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his mind, the plan is simple and will mean that the two children are content and happy and that his wealth is looked after in the way he envisages. But in reality, the plan is beset with obstacles and those involved begin to realise that sometimes life, unfortunately, brings things that werent planned for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the burden of weaving a detailed web of secrets and lies, some of them illegal, prove too much for the family and its closest associates, or will Roberts wishes come together to cement the happiness of his family forever?&lt;/p&gt;" />
