  <title>Freaks and Greeks - Timothy Bowden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;KNOW THYSELF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words are carved into the temple wall, but Miltiades of Athens doesn&amp;#39;t need their advice. He already knows who he is... a dull man, a spectator, someone who reads about the heroes of the past, unlikely to ever be one himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Or is he?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sent by the tyrants who killed his father to re-establish contact with a far flung colony near the Black Sea, Miltiades begins to find he may be more of a leader than he - or his family - expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risks are great. From fractious Thracian neighbours to the growing power of the Persian Empire, and the knowledge that someone in his camp is acting as a spy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is worse. A black flood is rising. A terrible sickness, spreading across the ancient world, that brings the dead back from the afterlife. And when they return, they are &lt;em&gt;hungry&lt;/em&gt;. Unleashed by the Egyptians in their greed for immortality, and fanned by the Persians as a weapon in their hunger for empire, it threatens the existence of Miltiades&amp;#39; little city-state and all he holds dear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not just them - for the Persian&amp;#39;s eyes are on the city of Athens itself, where a strange experiment is taking place: power is being held not by kings or the wealthy, but shared by all the citizens, together. They call it &lt;em&gt;demos kratia&lt;/em&gt;. But this small flame of freedom will lost unless Miltiades can stand against the tide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forces are gathering. The battle is here. A race for survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
