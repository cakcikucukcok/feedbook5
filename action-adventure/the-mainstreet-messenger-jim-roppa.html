  <title>The Mainstreet Messenger - Jim Roppa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The mysterious millionaire and highly successful corporate executive, Mathew Anthony (alias the Mailman), is back in action as he continues his quest for the quintessential America, driven by his idealistic passion for right as he perceives it. His mind, his obsession, is locked on the preservation of the values of family, hard work, and an unyielding loyalty to his country. The Mailman, an assassin who fears nothing, spends no time thinking about aspirations or his destiny. Thus, he worries little about his own lifes journey or its demise. He takes whatever action he feels is warranted when he encounters greed, decadence, harmful idealism, false intellect, social upheaval, and excess. His ambition in life is to improve the American landscape to perpetuate the prospect for opportunity to attain the American Dream for all. 
For Mathew Anthony, his identical twin brother, Thomas, is his most valued treasure and confidant. Their relationship from birth has been nothing short of uncompromising love and support for one another. A journey is about to take place that will not only affect their respective lives, their core values, and their reason for being but also the lives of the very nation the brothers so unconventionally love and defend. 
An extensive search by the CIA will be initiated to find the murderer of one of their own, Scott Johnson. The initial person of interest is a phantom assassin known only as The Mailman. Scott Johnson was his agency handler. Unbeknownst to them, the Mailman had personally made the delivery that rendered the demise of their agent, Johnson. 
Thomas Anthony launches his presidential campaign, which will challenge the underbelly of the powerful political establishment, only to encounter a maniacal assassination. The assassination planned and executed incites the brothers to action like never before. Those involved in the assassination will receive undesirable consequences from the elusive Mailman. No one is exempt, not even the president of the United States. 
SET NO LIMITS, HAVE NO FEAR, AND ALLOW NO REMORSE." />
