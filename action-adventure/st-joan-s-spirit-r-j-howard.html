  <title>St. Joan’S Spirit - R. J. Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ed Orceno never dreamed his past would come back to haunt him in such a perplexing way. As he and his wife pack up their RV and prepare to leave Southern California for a photography shoot in Utah, his former childhood sweetheart returns. Even more bizarre yet, Tessa is in spirit form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been over twenty years since Ed has heard Tessas voice. After she disappeared with another man, Eds fruitless search ended with just one disheartening realization: something bad had happened to Tessa. Now, as her anguished pleas echo throughout his head, Ed realizes it is up to him to rescue her from the misery of not knowing how she arrived in the spirit world and to ultimately find out how she died. But as he embarks on a quest for the truth, Ed soon discovers he can also converse with other spiritswho eventually help him uncover a human trafficking operationand what he hopes are the answers behind her untimely demise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paranormal tale, a spirit returns to the human world to reclaim her innocence and help her former lover seek justice for the immoral villains lurking in the shadows in the small town of St. Joan.&lt;/p&gt;" />
