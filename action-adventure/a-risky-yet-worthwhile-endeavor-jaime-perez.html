  <title>A Risky yet Worthwhile Endeavor - Jaime Perez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After seeing a mug shot on the local evening news of a familiar looking man who had just escaped from a nearby prison, part-time freelance journalist Alfredo Alvarez believes he has the chance to write his most important article yet. Alfredos instincts tell him that the man on the run was wrongfully convicted, but he realizes he will have to go to great lengths to uncover the real story.
Assuming the escapee has fled across the Texas-Mexico border, Alfredo accepts the fact that an ill-advised visit across the bridge may be his best chance to get the information he needs to help him construct his journalistic masterpiece and, more importantly, to possibly prove a shamed mans innocence. What he finds out on his perilous visit south of the border is much more than he expected, and he soon learns that discovering ones past can often help shape ones future and that sometimes taking a chance is the right thing to do.
In this novel, a journalist pursues the story of an escaped fugitive he
believes was wrongfully convicted and is surprised by his unlikely findings." />
