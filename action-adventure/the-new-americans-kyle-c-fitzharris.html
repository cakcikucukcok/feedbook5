  <title>The New Americans - Kyle C. Fitzharris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Michael Mick McCann spent ten years of his life in a Belfast political prison for his active involvement with the Irish Republican Army. Although now free from captivity, McCann is not yet free from the IRA. He no longer wants anything to do with the organization, but they wont let him loose until he fulfills one final mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCann is sent to Los Angeles, where he has been assigned to protect Ciara OMalley, the daughter of a powerful IRA general. Ciara, a Red Cross Aid Worker, places children orphaned by the devastating Indonesian tsunami with American host families; compared to McCann, shes a saint, and he figures his final assignment will pose no problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, fate is a cruel mistress; McCann arrives in LA to find that Ciara has been kidnapped by the ruthless Russian mob. Desperate, he soon enlists every gang-banger and criminal he can find to rescue Ciara. The City of Angels may break out into explosive battle if McCann doesnt move quickly. This is his last chance at freedom, a clean slate, and redemption.&lt;/p&gt;" />
