      <meta name="description" content="While they were growing up, Mary and her twin sister, Krisi, could not have been more different. Krisi craved adventure; Mary liked planting her feet firmly on the ground. As they became women, their inherent differences led them in separate directions. 
When Krisi became pregnant and suddenly asked Mary to raise her son, Mary couldnt refuse her sisters appeal for help, but soon the sisters lost touch. After two years of not hearing from Krisi, Mary learns that Krisi may be dead and that she may be a victim of murder. Mary refuses to believe it, for somewhere deep inside her, she feels certain that Krisi is still alive. 
After acquiring this shocking information, Mary focuses on raising Jordie, Krisis son, and tries to move on. But when her house is inexplicably ransacked, Mary begins to sense that someone is seeking her attention. When she sees the message scrawled on her wall, warning her to leave her house, she has no choice but to temporarily return to her childhood home, even though it holds unpleasant memories." />
