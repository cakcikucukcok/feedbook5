  <title>Centurion Justice - Ronald A. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mystery and Sex from the very first page.
&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s hard as steel but smooth as velvet. Bad, Black and Bold. Strolling through the city like Secretariat to the starting gate, all bets on him. A new hero, just when you thought there were none left.Working the ten inch barrel and the three inch slit.                                                                                                                                                                                          &lt;p&gt;Centurion Justice is the urban legend whom criminals fear and women hold dear. Guarding the gates of J&#39;s Ville. Standing in the gap, fighting off Hustlers and Hellhounds. Hes street smart and sexy, but C.J.s life has taken a wrong turn. Not only was he driving wasted during the accident that killed a doctors wife, a doctor for the Jacksonville Jaguars. He also lost his job as a vice detective in Jacksonville Florida, where he owned the streets.    
&lt;p&gt;The situation worsens when C.J.s best friend is murdered by a trio of dangerous Human Blood Beast: an Albino, an African, and a Black Dread. Was Slicks death a set-up? Was it a random killing? Are these same men responsible for the recent increase in the murder rate in Jacksonville? Whatever the circumstances, C.J. vows revenge, and he hits the streets he knows so well to track down the killers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gripping, urban crime story, &lt;i&gt;Centurion Justice&lt;/i&gt; tells a story of revenge and redemption through the grimy, sin-filled streets of Jacksonville to the emerald, diamond, and gold streets of the heavenly kingdom. It provides a real-world look through the imaginary eyes of a flawed hero living the real-life circumstances that challenged humans ability to exist. Centurion Justice opens up this world of pain, passion, murder, retaliation, and raw erotic lust and brings it to the throne of Jesus. In the end you&#39;ll know, you reap what you sow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
