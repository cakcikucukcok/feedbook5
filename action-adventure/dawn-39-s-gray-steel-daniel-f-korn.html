  <title>Dawn&#39;s Gray Steel - Daniel F. Korn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There has been many novels written about the Civil War in the East. Now Dan Korn brings to life the incredible story of the western theater&#39;s first major battle, the titantic struggle between two massive ill-prepared armies as they met on the shore of the mighty Tennessee River at a lazy riverboat landing called Pittsburg Landing. Nestled in a glen not far from the water&#39;s edge was a sleepy house of worship, named Shiloh Meetinghouse. Shiloh means &quot;place of peace.&quot; After the events of early April, 1862,Americans would never think of peace when they heard the name Shiloh everagain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Dawn&#39;s Gray Steel&lt;/em&gt;opens, the South is reeling over the recenttwin losses of the Tennessee forts Henry and Donelson, and the taking of the Tennessee capital, Nashville, by the thus far victorious western armies of the North.These victories have given the North a new hero in the form of a quiet and unassumingleader, Ulysses S. Grant.To the North, Grant has become &quot;Unconditional Surrender &quot; Grant. To end the string of Yankee victories, the Confederacy turns to the quixotic and charismatic Albert Sidney Johnston, a man some consider to be the greatest soldier in the Confederacy, and the man Jefferson Davis entrusts to save theConfederacy inthe West. It will become Johnston&#39;s mission to end Grant&#39;s run.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Victory has brought Grant fame, and with that fame comes a certainrelaxed feelingin Grant that allows him to place his still relatively inexperienced Army of the Tennessee into camp along the Tennessee without taking many defensive precautions. It is this relaxed atmosphere that causes deep anxiety in one of Grant&#39;s newest division commanders, the cigar-chomping, wild-eyed William Tecumseh Sherman. Grant assures his new subordinate that Johnston would be crazy to attackthe Union Armywhere they are. It is a mistake that Johnston is determined to make Grant regret.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Johnston refuses to heed the advice of his own subordinates and decides to launch an all out attack against the still unsuspecting Union camp. Against all odds the attackwill bealmost a complete surprise, stunning the unsuspecting Union forces with its ferocity. The bewildered Yankees fight back with pluck and equal determinationbut the Confederate forces will be on the verge of a stunning victory, when fate and the incredible stubbornness of one man intervenes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It will be here at Shiloh thatJohnston will bet his life androll the &quot;iron dice&quot; of battle in one magnificent gamble. In the smoke-filled swamps and ravines along the Tennessee, Sherman will be forced to finally face his fears, andfind a joy in the depth ofhis abilities he never knew existed.And it will be here, in the incredible maelstrom that roars about him, that Grant will demonstrate for all to see anamazingly unflappable coolness, a coolness that will allow him to see what no other man sees that day, andenable him to snatch an incrediblevictory fromalmost certain defeat. It will be an amazing ability that willhelp propelhim down the path tounprecedented glory, respect, and eventually, the trust of his President. A trust that will eventually bring Grant to the East, andan inevitable meeting with Robert E. Lee&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
