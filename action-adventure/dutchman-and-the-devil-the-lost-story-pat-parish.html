  <title>Dutchman and the Devil: The Lost Story - Pat Parish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For as long as I can remember, treasure hunters have been captivated by accounts of the Dutchman Jacob Waltz&amp;#39;s life and the whereabouts of his hidden gold mine. Can any tale be more compelling than that long unsolved mystery of millions of dollars of gold lost deep in the Superstition Mountains?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes - the REAL story, that will keep you on the edge of your seat!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Dutchman and the Devil: The Lost Story I examine the tangled trail of truth and fiction that is Waltz&amp;#39;s legacy and tell the tale of a man - and his shadowy undiscovered partner - who cheat, connive, manipulate, and murder their way through the wicked old west, leaving a trail of blood, bodies and broken promises that over the years have been lost in the wake of the commonly accepted family friendly legend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Friends who got a whiff of this story couldn&amp;#39;t wait for the next chapter of the spectacular spaghetti western that sprang from my typewriter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be among the first to read my story of the Dutchman and the Devil - but cross your heart and promise not to reveal its startling secret." />
