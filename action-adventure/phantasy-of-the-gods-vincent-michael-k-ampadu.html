  <title>Phantasy of the Gods - Vincent-Michael K. Ampadu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In an epic clash of the higher beings marshaled by the power-drunk alpha archangel, Vincelas with the Anthros led by eighteen year old Iula and the half-breed Karina, destiny unfolds in an intricate collage of passion, pride, greed, jealousy, blood and betrayal.On one of her regular evening walks through the enthralling forests of Amazonia, Athena, the beautiful queen of the Amazons, accompanied by her maidservants is lured by a magical and colorful vanishing creature into the presence of an old hag who prophesies about the destiny of the child she conceived that fateful night in which she broke the most sacred of Amazonian customs. Eighteen years afterwards, Iula, the son of the legendary Archeropian King, during the final rite of passage to warriorhood is captured by the Amazons amongst whom is Karina, the prophesied daughter of Athena and taken to Ambrosia, the land of the fairies. As he is brutally questioned to reveal the location of their sister fairies that had been systematically kidnapped for over a decade by his clan, a group of Archeropian warriors led by his father charge into Ambrosia and precipitate an intense and bloody battle during which his father, Leon is killed and Iula moved to Amazonia as a prisoner of war. Meanwhile, Vincelas, the alpha-archangel has built a massive army composed of the higher beings; archangels and elementals and has succeeded in uniting them behind the sole aim of decimating the Anthro population for recondite reasons which will not until the very end be revealed, but especially to hunt down and kill a then unknown half-breed who is also the daughter of his general, Juno. Juno manages to slip to Amazonia to warn Athena and bids her to follow his lead to a special place where she should be safe from the upcoming destruction but she refuses, choosing to stay with her clans people and instead attempts to forge an alliance with the Archeropians in order to organize an effective counter-offensive to the attack by the higher beings. Exasperated, Juno unsuccessfully attempts an anonymous coup to strike at Vincelas coalition from the heart.Kazan, Iulas uncle is very much against the unification of the two clans as he is aware that his own ambitions for power will be thwarted with their union and cunningly draws up an elaborate manipulative scheme to keep this from happening. After his clan reconciles with the Amazons, Iula and Karina lead an integration campaign as they adventure all over the world to enchanted lands inhabited by mystical creatures and the various Anthro races to recruit their own warriors in joining the largest army ever assembled in the history of the world. Intense drama ensues on their exciting but dangerous journey even as they struggle with the dynamics of their own growing attraction toward each other. Finally, in an epic clash of the Anthros with the higher beings, notwithstanding the loss of several valiant lives, the Anthro race emerges victorious and Vincelas is magically turned into a halfarchangel, half-anthro creature; the perfect cure for his hubris. Kazan, in a final desperate attempt at claiming the throne over the newly unified Anthro race attempts to poison Iula but is outsmarted by Iulas mother and ends up drinking the poison himself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
