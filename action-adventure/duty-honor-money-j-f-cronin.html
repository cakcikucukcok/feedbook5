  <title>Duty, Honor, Money - J. F. Cronin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Xavier Moran, USMC, better known as X, is out of the Afghanistan battlefieldhis first reprieve in over sixty days. As he arrives at the sprawling airbase at Bagram with nothing more than a pack, a weapon, and a reputation for getting things done, he secretly wishes he was back in the fight, where life is helter-skelter. When he is assigned a tough mission by Colonel Fran Matthews, X has no idea he is about to become immersed in the rampant corruption that surrounds the Afghan war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assigned to assume command of an isolated marine rifle company in disarray, X faces many challenges, including bringing casualties in line with operations, raising the marines morale, and facing off with the current battalion commander. As he heads to Kotjay to begin his mission, X is apprehensive. He must succeed; failure could mean the end of his careeror the end of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this action-packed military tale, X bravely stands up to the entrenched powers in Afghanistan. Caught between doing what is right and doing what is expected, he makes powerful enemies intent on ensuring his failure. Only time will tell if they will be successful.&lt;/p&gt;" />
