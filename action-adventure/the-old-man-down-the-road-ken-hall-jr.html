  <title>The Old Man Down the Road - Ken Hall Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To twelve-year-old Jacob Hunter, moving with his family to a small town in south Mississippi - a place he&#39;d never even heard of - means little more than having to get used to a new house, a new school, and trying to find new friends.  In less than a week, his world will be changed in ways he could never have imagined.
     A terrifying chain of events, set in motion by a simple prank, will serve to forge an unlikely bond between Jacob and Jim Hanes - a lonely, bitter old drunk.  And, as recurring nightmares and haunting visions begin to blur reality, he will come to discover the true power of friendship, redemption, and the hope of a child sustained by the power of faith.  But will it be enough when he finds himself pitted against a dark evil that has long slept, deep within the blackest corners of the soul of The Old Man Down The Road?
