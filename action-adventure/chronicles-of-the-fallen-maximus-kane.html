      <meta name="description" content="Jericho was among the most loved and divine of all the angels along with Michael, Gabriel, Azrael, and Lucifer.  Lucifer&#39;s greed grew and influenced Jericho to join him in his attempt to take over heaven but Jericho chose God over him.  For his betrayal Lucifer and his followers were cast into hell but not Jericho.  Once God created man he saw that Lucifer and his armies of demons would do anything to make humans suffer.  As a result by God&#39;s command Jericho was sentenced to walk the Earth forever fighting Lucifer, his demons, and any other evil that threatened the Earth and it&#39;s people. 
In Innocence, Jericho is called to investigate the disappearance of a seven year old boy.  However the investigation turns into something more when the boy is killed and another child is kidnapped.  The events leading up to the kidnapping and murder of the young boy is what made Jericho decide to investigate.  However when the boy&#39;s guardian angel is murdered Jericho realizes that this is something bigger than he anticipated.  Can Jericho find out what is happening before the second child is killed and can he stop what is really happening before it is too late?" />
