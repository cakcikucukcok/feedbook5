  <title>Brick City - George Stanley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the late 1960s, the New Jersey projects stood like tattered, tired sentinels across the Newark skyline. Some saw them as eyesores; others called them home. Despite the comfort of familiarity, it certainly wasnt easy being poor and black in the projects in 1962. Its a good thing four young boys had each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diesel, Bugs, Loony, and Larry are barely teenagers when they meet and become inseparable, bonded by poverty and race. They come of age in an environment they dont even realize is hostile. Summers are spent on adventuressometimes legal, sometimes not, and many times not safe. These wild days and nights keep the boys together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the projects arent all friends and fun. The boys deal with abuse, rough cops, and romantic connections that dont end well. They grow into men in this place affectionately known as brick city, yet they dont leave unscathed. For better or worse, the projects turn these boys into men, but not everyone gets out alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
