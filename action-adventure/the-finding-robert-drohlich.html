      <meta name="description" content="&quot;In an ancient cave in the mountains of Israel animal skins, centuries old, with strange markings on its dusty and dirty surface, were found by a mountain hiker who gathered the skins and took them to his home. Authoritative sources believe that if the ancient markings on the skins can be deciphered it could change history and solve the bitter dispute between Israelis and Muslims of the occupation of Jerusalem. The struggle for the ownership of the finding results in conflicts that claims lives and threaten those who have possession of the treasure.
The Finding is a story of intrigue, love of country and the passionate lives of the people who the finding brings together. It is an adventure that by-passes the usual novel of pages of descriptive scenery, dcor and fashion. It travels at a fast literary pace through its sixty chapters and climaxes in an ending that brings the finding to life.&quot;" />
