  <title>With Intent - Noel Lipton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rob Hidden is not a nice guy. Hes a criminal, and he likes being a criminal. Hes good at it, and he finds that doing bad stuff makes him feel good. One night this heartless villain comes home to his wife, who informs him the police are on his tail. He lashes out at her, and so began a tirade that would lead to abuse, robbery, and murder. It all started when Rob decides to hide out at the home of his friend, Dave Cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears Dave wasnt expecting company. Seeing the huge pile of money on his table, Rob decides to do what he does best: steal the money and shoot Dave. Seasoned police officer Morgan Sill is called to the scene, but Rob doesnt get far before he is spotted. Sill chases him down, forcing Rob to drop the murder weaponjust what the police need to charge Rob and get him to court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is simple, though. First, the court must decide if Rob is fit for trial  or if hes too blatantly crazy to even receive a sentence. Then, theres the court-appointed slimeball lawyer, Crabtree, who will say anything to keep his client out of jail. Sill is worried that Rob is going to get off without even a slap on the wrist. Is there anything the cops can do to stop him, or will evil prevail in the streets? &lt;/p&gt;" />
