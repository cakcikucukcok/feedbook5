  <title>A Dangerous Garden - Brent Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Daniel Mathews was strong, industrious and honest. He was a nice
guy. He was also a drug dealer. He cultivated marijuana for a living. During
the course of one fateful year in the mid 1980s, Daniel would have the metal
of his character tested to its limits. His illegal lifestyle was rife with
treacherous pitfalls. Was it possible for him to retain his integrity and
continue his dangerous business?
&lt;p&gt;
The tranquil and beautiful valleys of British Columbia are the setting
for this story of intrigue and betrayal where Daniel Matthews resides. He
farms and ranches there, his main crop consisting of the illegal plant
marijuana. He has several partners, other local residents. This novel takes
place over the course of one year in four parts, from summer to spring
wherein Daniel questions his dangerous lifestyle - the growing and selling of
marijuana. His son is sixteen, and at the age when he is exposed to
marijuana and other drugs- a fact which greatly concerns Daniel. Daniel and
his friends Tommy and Brian cultivate large plots of the crop and spend most
of their time tending to them, and worrying about them. Numerous other
neighbours in the rural area also grow the illegal herb.
&lt;p&gt;
An unexpected visitor, Cheyenne, arrives at Daniel&#39;s farm. He is an old
friend whom they suspect has become a narcotics agent. This complicates an
already dangerous situation.
&lt;p&gt;
Through the harrowing and dangerous summer and autumn months of growing
and harvesting Daniel grows increasingly unhappy with his lifestyle. He
begins to question what he does, who his friends are, and what he really
wants in his life.
&lt;p&gt;
The climax sees Daniel discovering evidence of betrayal and perhaps even
murder. His life-altering decision can no longer be postponed.
