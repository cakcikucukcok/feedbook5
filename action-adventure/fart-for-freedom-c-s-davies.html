  <title>Fart for Freedom - C.S. Davies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Two demented psychotic groups are engaged in a battle for moral, if not hygienic superiority. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Fart For Freedom, with their freedom farters like the Silent But Deadly assassins and Curry Men explosive experts, are steadfastly led by their leaders; the Inner Rectum. Their sole purpose in life is to make the world a place where anyone can fart anytime and anywhere, without fear of retribution. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Opposing them is STOP; the Society To Oppress Perverts- a group that brings a whole new meaning to the term anal retentiveness. Their puritanical view of the world sets them against the freedom farters at every turn. In the STOP world; clean equals serene. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Unwillingly thrown into this turbulent situation is Algenon Plugg; a mild-mannered man with a traumatic past. After memories of his childhood catch up with him at a most inopportune time, he is hurled into a maelstrom that threatens death and destruction for anyone who crosses his path. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If Fart For Freedom is to survive, they must eliminate the opposition before they themselves are eliminated. &lt;/P&gt;
