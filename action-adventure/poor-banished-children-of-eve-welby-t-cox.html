  <title>Poor Banished Children of Eve - Welby T Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some people kill you with a joke, the colonel would just kill you. He was born in a canebreak by an old mama lion who abandoned him before he was weaned. He became a thing of nature and being a warrior was natural, so he found brutality in WWI and as a soldier-of-fortune, he was shot five times, died and during which time he had an aberration in which he was rebuked as having died. He was informed by a small garish woman with a monkey on her shoulder that he wasn&#39;t dead...just gone! He swore to do better, to become a good person and he chose to recuperate in British Columbia where he could hunt and fish, drink Scotch Whiskey and play poker. But death followed the colonel, his guide died in the icy waters and the colonel was arrested for murder. But there was salvation in a romance with a quirky female who only ate on the floor and slept there as well. She also insisted upon licking him! Follow the colonel as he fights the system and discovers a son he never knew." />
