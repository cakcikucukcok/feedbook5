  <title>Sick Heart River - John Buchan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John Buchan was Governor-General of Canada at the time of writing this book. The main character, the lawyer and politician Sir Edward Leithen - the most autobiographical of Buchan&amp;#39;s characters - has been diagnosed with advanced tuberculosis and has been given a year to live. At the same time, a former colleague requests his help to find his niece&amp;#39;s husband who disappears. Leithen agrees to help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was Buchan&amp;#39;s last book, and a very moving one, probably his best lesser-known work and one not to be missed by Buchan fans, to be sure!&lt;br /&gt;
