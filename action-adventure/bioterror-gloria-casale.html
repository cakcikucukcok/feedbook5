  <title>Bioterror - Gloria Casale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Yuri Bushinikov, a renowned Russian genetics engineer, has gone missing, along with two vials from the Russian smallpox stockpile. Dr. Anne Damiano has feared this scenario for many years. Her warnings have been ignored by other, more powerful Public Health officials. They adamantly deny the possibility of a bioterror attack.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Bushinikov, fueled by his concern for his young family, succumbs to an offer from Al Halbi, the director of the Syrian Institute for Science and International Security. Huge amounts of money, and multiple false IDs for the biologist and each member of his family will insure their dramatic escape from Russia. As directed, Bushinikov delivers the virus to an intermediary in Jakarta. Al Halbi plans to process the virus into a bioterror weapon that will destroy the Great Satan.  Annes fear is rapidly becoming reality.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Death and mayhem arent Annes ideas of romance. Yet, when the Director of the CIA teams her up with her long lost love, Connor Quinlan, sparks as well as bullets fly. Anne and Connor must collaborate to stop Al Halbis plan to inflict disease, mass terror, and death. Will they be too late to avert an international disaster?&lt;/p&gt;" />
