  <title>The Sucker - T Reddy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story is about Lynx Ferry, a young boy who, at a very early age, is bound by a pledge he makes to his father. He will help the deprived at all times and feed everyone who comes knocking at his door. He keeps the promise, much against his mothers wishes, and nearly loses his life for helping his neighbours. He knew then that if he stays a minute longer in the kitchen, he will lose his life. He walks out of his mothers kitchen with blood running down his throat, and thats when his adventures begin. 
He attracts all kinds of people on his journey but mostly con artists, thieves, and drug addicts. They call him the sucker because of his desire to feed people and give his belongings to people who ask him for them. 
Then there is one drug addict who is out of the same neighbourhood as the boyand who knows of the boys weaknesses. He knows how to exploit it and figures that if the boy is free with his money by giving it away, then he could claim 10 per cent from the boys earnings and feed his habits. But the boy, who doesnt hold with drugs and liquor, refuses. He has better uses for his money. 
The boy is now streetwise and has been living outdoors for some time. He takes evasive measures and disappears from the drug addict. He travels abroad, and years later, he marries and settles down in London. By some extraordinary bad luck, the drug addict tracks him down and makes his demand, but Lynx Ferry wont budge. 
The addict then teams up with a couple of local toughs, kidnaps Ferrys children, murders them, and disappears. After many years of searching to bring the murderers to justice, which proves futile, Lynx uses the power of the mind to draw them to him. Then in the frozen wasteland of the snowcapped Arctic, the subliminal message draws them out, and Lynx Ferry has his say." />
