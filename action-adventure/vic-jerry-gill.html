  <title>Vic - Jerry Gill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is this &amp;nbsp;real? &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;For years, &amp;nbsp;Victoria Custer thought she was dreaming.&lt;br /&gt;
While big game hunting in Africa, Victoria discovers her powerful and savage past &amp;nbsp;and remembers her soul mate from 1000 generations ago. &amp;nbsp;Her alter ego or avatar of that life - the cave girl - &amp;ldquo;moves in&amp;rdquo; so to speak. &amp;nbsp;Refusing to accept that true love dies she begins the search for her lost love, and finds the modern world may hold as many dangers as her stone age life! &amp;nbsp;That&amp;rsquo;s OK, because she vividly recalls that primitive life when there was no such thing as &amp;ldquo;have a bad day&amp;rdquo; because they were all bad. &amp;nbsp;Life was a continuous grueling struggle to survive. &amp;nbsp;That new attitude comes in handy, too. &amp;nbsp;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it is the indwelling avatar that attracts them or something else, Vic runs into bad guys and monsters everywhere she travels. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Then Vic takes her first trip as a travel writer. &amp;nbsp;She visits the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. &amp;nbsp;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite the tourist destination it is today. &amp;nbsp;Vic is attacked by the wildlife, battles heartless slavers, and meets her first hungry cryptid. &amp;nbsp;One lesson learned: you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be brave, you just need to do what needs done - which becomes Vic&amp;rsquo;s motto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast paced and unpredictable, action adventure in the tradition of the adventure pulps of the early 20th Century. &amp;nbsp;If you like Doc Savage, The Avenger (Dick Benson), Nancy Drew, or Tarzan or any other novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs you will love Vic Challlenger. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What reviewers think of the series:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Vic Challenger personifies every sword or ax wielding heroine ever drawn by any heroic fantasy artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;the female answer to Indiana Jones&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Great Campy Multi-Genre Book&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have recommended the Vic Challenger books to my wife and to all of my children&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Any of these novels would make a really good movie.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;if you like Clive Cussler or James Rollins, these are definitely the books for you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The Incredible Adventures of Vic Challenger&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp; series is inspired by writers like Edgar Rice Burroughs, H. Rider Haggard, Jules Verne, Arthur Conan Doyle and H. G. Wells; and by characters like Nancy Drew, Lara Croft, Alan Quatermain, Doc Savage and his cousin Patricia Savage, and Dick Benson and his assistant Nellie Gray. &amp;nbsp; The writing style has been compared to Burroughs and is also reminiscent of early &amp;nbsp;action driven horror novels by Graham Masterton,The series is set in the 1920&amp;rsquo;s and considerable research adds to the &amp;ldquo;realism&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;You will find yourself effortlessly learning bits of history, some of which may amaze you. &amp;nbsp; Vic&amp;rsquo;s travels are woven into the history of the time, so you may be asking yourself &amp;ldquo;Is this real?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
