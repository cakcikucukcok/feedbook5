  <title>Easy - Russell Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Speed ( later to be known as Easy ) is a three-day-old pup found in a discarded
suitcase on a rubbish tip by Barney, a tan-coloured Labrador cross and Jack a black-andwhite
Collie mix, who has a reputation with the ladies. Speeds mother Jenny and siblings
have been captured by two of the councils dedicated pest controllers ( William and Benjamin
. . . brothers), who take great pleasure in their work, as they consider all dogs are vermin.
Unknown to Barney, Jack is the father of Jennys litter. The animals are taken to the pound and
exterminated by means of an electric current passed through a steel rod, suffering agonies in
their death throws. Barneys friend Lulu has recently delivered her own litter and is persuaded
to adopt Speed. Bernie, so named as he bears an uncanny resemblance to a St Bernard, is an
old, wise, street dog and leader of the pack and a long-time friend of Barney. Jack and Harold
are the two remaining members. The latter being a pure bred Husky of this most feared gang
operating in and around Dalman, a holiday resort in the southern Turkey. The packs main
adversary is Big Bill, a mastiff and his gang.
Three months later, Lulus owners decide to uproot and relocate. Having found homes
for her pups, Speed is promised to the ginger-headed lad, who lives next door, who is constantly
teasing him. Speed being a feisty pup retaliates and nips the boys hand.
The owners decide to have him put down. Barney comes to the rescue and persuades
Bernie to let Speed join the pack. Reluctantly, Bernie agrees, providing Barney takes full
responsibility for him. Speed is instrumental in a well-planned successful raid on Abraham
Burders cafe/restaurant. Abraham complains to Mohammed Ismik, an old school friend, who
heads the pest control department." />
