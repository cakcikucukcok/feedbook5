  <title>By Papal Decree - Norbert E. Reich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With his knees buried in the hot sand and his hands tied behind his back, an American doctor who came to Syria to help needy people stares into the camera. Seconds later, the masked man behind him hands a large knife to an Arab teenager who beheads the doctor. As President Monica Drew watches the video in horror, she decides to create what she hopes is her legacy. 
Professional killer Adam Bergman has just washed up on the Bahamian shores, naked inside a skiff, without any idea of how he got there or who shot him. Determined to find answers, he returns to his childhood church in Germany, meets his former pastor, and learns that the pope wants to achieve peace in the Middle East through religion. The Holy Father cannot fulfill his mission without Adams help in protecting him from those who want him dead. But when tragedy strikes without warning, it leaves Adam reeling, the world in chaos, and just one man holding the answer to peace. 
In this religious thriller, a course of transformative events unfolds when the pope decides to make peace in the Middle East and hires a hit man to help him achieve his goal." />
