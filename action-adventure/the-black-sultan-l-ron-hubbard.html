  <title>The Black Sultan - L. Ron Hubbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Meet Eddie Moran, a slightly disreputable American cooling his heels in  French Morocco.&amp;#160; Like a young Cary Grant, he&amp;rsquo;s as smooth as they come.  He&amp;rsquo;s pulled off any number of crooked schemes, but his latest caper is  one he may not be able to escape&amp;hellip;even if he wants to.&amp;#160; Imprisoned by The  Black Sultan, Eddie falls for a stunning young woman in the Sultan&amp;rsquo;s  harem.&amp;#160; For her, he might go straight&amp;mdash;if he can get them out of this  hellhole alive.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;When  The Black Sultan was originally published, Hubbard said that writers  too often &amp;ldquo;forget a great deal of the languorous quality which made the  Arabian Nights so pleasing. Jewels, beautiful women, towering cities  filled with mysterious shadows, sultans equally handy with robes of  honor and the beheading sword.&amp;hellip; These things still exist, undimmed,  losing no luster to the permeating Occidental flavor which reaches even  the far corners of the earth today.&amp;rdquo; Hubbard brings this unique insight  to his stories of North Africa and the Legionnaires, investing them with  an authenticity of time, place and character that kept his readers  asking for more.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also includes the adventure story,  Escape for Three, in which a bold trio of French Legionnaires come to  the rescue of their great leader&amp;mdash;only to decide he may not be so great  after all.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;ldquo;Action, strong characters, suspense, snappy dialogue, and titillating romance.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&amp;mdash;Publishers Weekly&lt;/div&gt;" />
