  <title>Minion or Master - Martin Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Minion or Master is a fast paced thriller set in 1966 that interweaves different story lines and characters leaving the reader in suspense as each section ends until the final conclusion.
The story subtly develops the Minion or Master concept whilst exploring relationships between father and son, pimp and prostitute, gang leaders and gang members, civil servant and business man as well as romantic involvement. 
George Howden, a young inexperienced businessman working in Bermuda is forced by circumstance to try to defeat a prostitution and drugs gang in New York. His business involvement with the ship Ocean Star makes him an accessory in smuggling chrome ore out of Africa and smuggling armaments for terrorists into Africa. 
George gets involved with a number of believable well drawn characters who are mixed up with murder, sex, blackmail, government power politics, drug smuggling, drug dependency and romance. The story describes how he and others build relationships to last a lifetime and how some get destroyed.
The action starts in Africa and moves seamlessly between Bermuda, New York, and the Atlantic Ocean.
Minion or Master is the first in a series of thrillers featuring George Howden and Adrian Cuthbert covering the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries." />
