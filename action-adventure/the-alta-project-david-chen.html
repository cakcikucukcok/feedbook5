  <title>The Alta Project - David Chen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;James Jeffreys has mysteriously disappeared following an accident. &lt;br /&gt;Dr Albert Anderson, the chief medical officer at BCG, awakens after a 5 year coma   in 2017. Isolated and unable to communicate with the outside world, he learns of the developments that have transpired under the new military police state. &lt;br /&gt;The 2009 pandemic has reduced the world population by 1/3, and the ensuing chaos creates a financial, political, and religious climate unimaginable; but previously predicted. &lt;br /&gt;As Anderson is trying to figure out where he is and how he got there, the Jeffreys family makes a disturbing discovery in their home, launching a search which leads to a shocking turn of events. &lt;br /&gt;When BCG CEO Donald Parsons realizes there is a glitch in the project, things start going horribly wrong. &lt;br /&gt;Learning of Anderson and Jeffreys whereabouts   or their fate, becomes the all consuming focus of the US military police, as well as a mysterious and dangerously powerful Italian man, Giovanni. &lt;br /&gt;Science, politics, and prophecy all converge on the success or failure of the ALTA project. &lt;br /&gt;Only a small group of individuals understand the true implications of the ALTA project, and how it could change the world   forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
