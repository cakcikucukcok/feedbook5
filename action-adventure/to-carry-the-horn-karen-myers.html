  <title>To Carry the Horn - Karen Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW JOB, NEW FAMILY, AND IN TWO WEEKS THE END OF A WORLD HE&#39;S JUST DISCOVERED, IF HE CAN’T RISE TO THE CHALLENGE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book 1 of &lt;strong&gt;The Hounds of Annwn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Talbot Traherne is just doing his job on a fine autumn morning, keeping the hounds together for the huntsman of the Rowanton Hunt in Virginia along the Blue Ridge Mountain. Doesn&#39;t pay to get distracted by a white stag in unfamiliar territory, though. Next thing you know, you might find yourself... somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The land is the same but not the people. Their huntsman has just been murdered, and George is tapped for the job. It&#39;s an emergency -- the Wild Hunt is only two weeks away, and if it doesn&#39;t happen on schedule, the antlered god Cernunnos will take the realm from its ruler Gwyn ap Nudd and find someone who can mete out justice with the Hounds of Hell in his place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George throws himself into the task, finding strength in the mission and resources he never knew he had. The more he comes to feel at home, settling into his new responsibilities, the more he wants to stay and make a life for himself. He&#39;s finally met someone worth spending his life with, even if she&#39;s just a bit older, a mere fifteen hundred years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can he keep the Wild Hunt on track despite the attempts to thwart it? Will he be accepted by those he wants to defend who view his timely presence and his human blood with suspicion? Above all, what does Cernunnos want of him and how far will he go? Can he survive the attention of a god?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers who are familiar with the sources of Arthurian literature such as the &lt;em&gt;Mabinogion&lt;/em&gt; will recognize many of the characters, flourishing still in the world we cannot quite reach.&lt;/p&gt;" />
