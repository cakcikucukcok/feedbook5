  <title>She Cries - Alexandra Allred</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; With storylines that could have easily been pulled from headline news, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;She Cries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is both a suspense/thriller and surprising love story that will have readers on the edge of their seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Kali Jorgensen is left to raise her three daughters alone after her husband is killed in the war in Afghanistan, she takes up residence in Horse Canyon, Utah, heading up a working ranch with her in-laws for cattle drives for celebrities and CEOs.&amp;nbsp; With its breathtaking sunsets and beautiful ranch rich with family history, Rainwash Ranch is the only place Kali wants to live. Along with her family, her horse, Star, is her greatest companion.&amp;nbsp; Without the city lights and blaring headlines from a television, she could easily live in the saddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this solitude is quickly broken as unwanted worldwide attention is thrust upon the ranch when professional athlete Jeremy Connors signs up for the cattle drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Connors, recently indicted for rape and murder, comes his legal Dream Team, and a whole host of problems for the Rainwash Ranch.&amp;nbsp; While Connor&amp;rsquo;s presence is a concern for Kali and her daughters, she soon realizes that it is Connor&amp;rsquo;s fans and his team of lawyers who may prove to be the most dangerous to the Jorgensens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the personalities of horses and lawyers are matched together, cowboys are pitted against city slickers for the ride of a lifetime. For Kali, it is her greatest test, not only as an instructor but also a mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;She Cries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a nail-biting, suspense novel that will leave you signing up for a cattle drive and falling in love with the most unlikely of heroes. Even if you&amp;rsquo;ve never ridden a horse, you&amp;rsquo;ll come to understand the power of these magnificent animals and how hope can keep you alive.&lt;/p&gt;
