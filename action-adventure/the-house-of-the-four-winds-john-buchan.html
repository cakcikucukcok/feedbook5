  <title>The House of the Four Winds - John Buchan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;The House of the Four Winds&amp;quot; is a novel of adventure by John Buchan, first published in 1935. It is a Ruritanian romance, and the last of his three &lt;i&gt;Dickson McCunn books&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The novel is set in the fictional Central European country of Evallonia in the early 1930s. It concerns the involvement of some Scottish visitors in the overthrow of a corrupt republic and the restoration of the monarchy. Scottish grocer Dickson McCunn features in his most exciting role. Gorbals Die-hards, Jaikie and his pals, are now dabbling in politics. On his trek across Europe, Jaikie is warned to avoid Evallonia. It is in danger of being overthrown by the cruel Mastrovin. However Jaikie cannot resist taking a look and ends up being kidnapped twice. Moreover, he is not the only one needing to be rescued, and Evallonia&amp;rsquo;s fate hangs in the balance until Dickson McCunn appears on the scene.&lt;br /&gt;
It is a sequel to &amp;quot;Huntingtower&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Castle Gay&amp;quot;, in which some Evallonians visited Scotland on a secret mission two years before the start of this novel." />
