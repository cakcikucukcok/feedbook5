  <title>Lure - Lure</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cara Cahill has been trying to avoid her special gift since she was a child and realized she was different from everyone else. Born in Ireland to a mortal Mother and an incubus Father, Cara was bestowed with a special ability to sense the Supernatural beings around her by their colourful auras. Her gift soon became a curse as she realized that all the beings she could sense were drawn to her, whether she liked it or not.
	Now a grown woman, traveling around the Irish countryside with a runaway faerie and a disgruntled leprechaun, Cara discovers an unlikely group of Supernaturals who are on the hunt for her. When they are inevitably drawn to her she is forced into an uneasy alliance with three werewolves and two vampires. They believe that a recent earthquake that was followed by a raven&#39;s eerie cry was the first sign of Ragnarok; the end of the world. 
The ancient Norse god, Loke, has been released from his imprisonment in the underworld and is biding his time while his army of demons and giants gathers and awaits the final war to be waged. 
Cara scrambles to uncover the reason why an ancient god is so interested in finding her while keeping her apprehensive team of misfits working together, fighting off demon attacks, avoiding hostile supernatural encounters and protecting her heart from a vampire who is the only supernatural being she has ever come across who cant feel her lure and seems able to break through all of her defenses. All before the destined battle that spells the end of mankind and decides the fate of the world." />
