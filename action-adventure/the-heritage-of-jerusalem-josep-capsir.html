  <title>The Heritage Of Jerusalem - Josep Capsir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hugo Di Bella, a History student, has an old copy of Hebrew book in his family library. This book, written in the period of the incunabula, was rescued before being destroyed by the Pontiff’s supreme power. A call from his professor, David Malluck, PhD in Ancient History, causes him to know the existence of the incunabula. Moved by his historic interest in a unique book and curiosity, Malluck will meet with his pupil and he will invite a good friend, Philologist Lucio Servade in order to translate from Hebrew the secrets hidden in the mysterious book.&lt;br/&gt;
Little by little, they will find the clues coded in the book’s contents and they will be discovering the locations of the Solomon Temple’s treasures and the changes in their location they’ve had during the last centuries. They will discover where the Ark of the Covenant, the True Cross and Jesus of Nazareth’s apocryphal gospel are hidden.&lt;br/&gt;
The three of them, will have to decode the encoded texts contained in the “Transfer of the commitments to safeguard the Abode of the Testimonies and the Sacred Tools”.&lt;br/&gt;
After decoding the puzzles hidden in the book, they will embark on a fascinating and dangerous search of some of the hidden treasures.&lt;br/&gt;
But the ancient and most secret congregation in the world is still watching over so some things never see the light.&lt;br/&gt;
Because the truth is dangerous…&lt;br/&gt;" />
