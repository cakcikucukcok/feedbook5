  <title>The Forks of the Ohio - James David Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Leaving the Mohawk Valley of New York colony young Logan McGill, the superb frontiersman Davey Duncan and the irascible Turley travel to the wilds of the Ohio country wishing only to hunt and trap. But they soon learn that their peaceful intentions are not enough as they are harassed by blood thirsty savages, a vengeful antagonist, and ultimately become swept up in a brutal frontier war.&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After rescuing the beautiful Elizabeth Hay from her savage kidnappers the four seek refuge with a small, destitute army of Virginia militia. Led by the young and brave but inexperienced Colonel George Washington the Virginians must wrest possession of the forks of the Ohio from the French. Marching through a damp night they surprise a camp of French soldiers and fire the first shots that reignite the decades long conflict between England and France over control of North America. And once again numerous Indian nations are forced to choose which side to fight for. Though the Indians themselves realize that whoever wins, it is the Redman who will be the ultimate loser.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From the Iroquois villages of the Mohawk Valley to the skirmish at Jumonvilles Glen and the Battle of Fort Necessity, through General Edward Braddocks fateful expedition to Duquesne, The Forks of the Ohio brings to life the opening events of The French and Indian War as related by Logan McGill. The saga of Logan and his companions continues in the sequel, Holy Sacrament, where the bloody struggle shifts to the New York frontier and the Battle of Lake George.&lt;/P&gt;" />
