  <title>Egyptian Gold - Kila El Amarna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love, sex, war, and magic &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 330 BC in Egypt, a beautiful young girl named Kilah had no grasp of the adventures she was destined to know. Already, she had seen twelve risings of the Nile, and she was not yet married. This upset her; most girls her age were married and already had two children. But in a flashas quick as lightningshe would find that she no longer had time to obsess about her lack of a family. She was about to be catapulted into a world of challenges so daunting that most men would run from them. Overnight, Kilahs destiny became grander than any she could understand at such an age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was destined to ascend the throne as queen and pharaoh of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Kilahs wide and ambitious eyes, a new view of ancient Egypt emerges, in which the true identity of the prophet Moses is revealed. Despite what historians say, he was not the child of slaves. Hidden papyrus text revealed Moses was actually the heretic pharaoh Akhenaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Darius of Persia, Alexander the Great, Akhenaten, and his dangerous queen, Nefertiti, all play their parts in Kilahs strange new world. Love, sex, war, and magic are timeless elements in a story that reaches across the ages in &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gold: The Journey&lt;/em&gt;, the first book in Kila el Amarnas trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
