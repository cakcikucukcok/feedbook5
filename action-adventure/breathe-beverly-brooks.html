  <title>Breathe - Beverly Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A spiritual allegory set in a small village named Jerilum, Breathe invites the reader to a simpler time and place as a backdrop to a deadly play of power.  Jerilum is a peaceful village steeped in tradition but with a force of evil ready to engulf it.  Darkness, unrecognized until almost too late, has infiltrated Jerilum.  A sanctuary exists nearby in the form of a beautiful, lush forest, which is used for traditional times of walking such as weddings, burials, and celebrations of birth.  But as demons advance, the people are going to need more than tradition.  There among the trees, Grandma Bohn, the beautiful Annabel, and a crippled young man named Luke find peace, and more importantly a friend named Yashmea.  While a few villagers build their lives around their friendship with Yashmea, others are less enthused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the darkest day comes in the life of Malachi, Annabels husband, he may have to consider that friendship so long left unexplored.  What he doesnt realize is that the fate of a village hangs on his decision.  There seem to be so many deaths, but then again everything is not as it seems.  Malachi, exhausted by grief, is finally drawn to find Yashmea.  But will he find him in time?&lt;/p&gt;" />
