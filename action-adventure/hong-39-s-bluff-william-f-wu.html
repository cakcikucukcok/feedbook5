  <title>Hong&#39;s Bluff - William F Wu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this light-hearted, futuristic Wild West, Louie Hong, the young, all-human cousin of a cyborg gunfighter known as &amp;ldquo;the Hong,&amp;rdquo; just wants to survive&amp;mdash;and earn his cousin&amp;rsquo;s respect. He lives in a frontier where most people have whatever electronic cyborg parts they want and can afford. In this parody of westerns, Louie faces a conundrum when his cousin needs help with a gunfight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This short story was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula Awards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No one living had ever seen Hong without the big chain on his neck. No one had ever maneuvered him into the street when he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go or beaten him at a game of cards, either. Oh, he had been known to lose a hand or two, and once even a foot, but never an eyeball or a new joint.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was lean, wiry, and stainless. His arms were gooseneck molybdenum steel, one of which he won &amp;mdash; I hear &amp;mdash; by bluffing Salt Morass into folding with three of a kind to Hong&amp;rsquo;s nine-high.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Grudge the Smith says he charged $112,000 to make the left one, and Hong paid in cash. This was the day after Hong faced down Red-Eared Rick in the street and made him cough up the take from his last bank job &amp;mdash; all over the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hong had one silver eye and one gray eye, and they say he was harder to stare down than a one-eyed flounder." />
