  <title>Go Fish - Vailore Anandan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book contains three parts.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Part 1: &lt;br&gt;
Adam was an auto worker; he wanted to take a long vacation before his retirement.  He wanted to make his soul searching trip on his car named Rudy.  He wanted to figure out his life for the last time.  Adam, his son Cady and his daughter-in-law Elena and his grand daughter Mothi took the road trip to California.  They did a lot of camping and fishing.  Adam talks about the evolution of life form as he understood.  He proposes a parametric system due to the variation of the basic dimensions such as time, energy, humanity and system.  He shows the niche for the existance of various species.  Thus they do not have a preprogrammed malice in their mind for their existance.  It is just a manifestation of energy.  We should not misuse the term survival of the fittest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Part 2:&lt;br&gt;
They talked about various philosophies as they went thru the trip.  Adam told many stories to explain his concepts.  He talks about a comprehensive outlook of all the current political systems such as individualism, socialism and communism from the existence point of view.  Thus a connectivity between the systems can be established to transact in a humane way.  This could avoid various political imbalance in the society, whether it may be a local or international.  As all the philosophers have mentioned, if we can understand or define a problem well then we are already in the process of fixing it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He talks about the logic for religious philosophy.  He explains that the process of looking beyond the individual or social or communalism is the basis for religion.  It is a process for looking beyond our lives.  He also explains that the most common hurdle that you face in the thought process of science or philosophy (rationale) is the entity called Conflict.  We do not face such hurdle in the religious thought process.  It is beyond the bounds of existence and hence we do not have the bounds of existence and hence the entity of conflict disappears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
		He also talks about the human intuition.  He talks about how to develop the human intuition, which is useful to form large patterns as well as to understand large patterns, without the complete rationale (understanding).  He touches on the topic of Order and Chaos.  He talks on the subject beyond the classical analysis of a broken cup and its implication on physics.  He mentions his comments on the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the various entities.  Adam explains these concepts in short stories to his grand daughter Mothi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Part 3:&lt;br&gt;
		They progress well into their trip.  They reach San Francisco and went around with their family and friends.  They made a number of camping.  Adam was continuing his discourses.  He talked about Time and its manifestation.  He proposes the attributes of energy that makes the time move forward or makes a path where it evolves us to a better and able people as well as form a stable and peaceful system.  He proposes to obtain a positive arrow of time.  He continues his thought to form a theoretical process using systems and knowledge and science of mathematics.  He talks about the basis of various systems such as mathematics, music, language and computers and so on, how to transfer between them and how the knowledge was perceived in the olden days thru human body and mind.  It was a mind boggling session on the perception of human mind on the grand theories and how he uses his own body and mind to perceive them understand them and formulate them.
		&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He talks about error and the way we need to perceive it and he also mentions on the body model, mind model and the interaction of energy and time.  He talks about energy and subjective energy and his experiment with information.  He talks about Natural vs. Artificial design.  He uses the information theories and the financial systems and energy principles to create a proposal for inventing new material (without the use of expen" />
