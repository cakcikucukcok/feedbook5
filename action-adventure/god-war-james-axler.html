      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The Annunaki, a power-hungry and hate-driven alien race, have returned to take over Earth. This time, permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And the hard-core human rebels who fought to repel these self-proclaimed gods have paid a terrible price. Just when they are needed most–as the post apocalyptic threat surges to terrifying new levels–the Cerberus operation lies broken, its key members missing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ullikummis has chosen Earth as ground zero for a terrifying family reunion. A son born of cruelty, genetic manipulation and infinite power, for 4,000 years the stone god has waited, plotting his revenge against his father, Enlil, the most sadistic of the Annunaki. As father and child unleash their armies in a clash of titanic proportions, the bravest of the rebels, Kane, is humanity&#39;s last hope to halt this deadly war of the gods. Endgame has finally arrived…but who will be the winner?&lt;/p&gt;
