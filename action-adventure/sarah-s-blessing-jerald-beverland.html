  <title>Sarah’S Blessing - Jerald Beverland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the 1800s, the great and uncharted American West promised a glimmer of hope to poor folks east of the Mississippi River in need of new adventure and new life. Wagon trains traveled the renowned Oregon and Mormon Trails, their paths often paved with the graves of courageous men and women who dreamt of gold and the promise of prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John McCrumb takes his family on one such dangerous trek, in including his beloved wife, Sarah, their two beautiful daughters, Lucy and Amy, and their two adventurous sons, Jerald and Jacky. A ragtag group of extras tags along on their journey, including some cowpokes from Tennessee, a blind girl, and a giant mountain man, each answering the call for an alluring life out west. Despite Sarahs deteriorating health, John presses on toward their goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They must survive a buffalo stampede, an angry grizzly, and even kidnapping by Ute Indians before reaching their final destination. The Wild West is a beautiful, untamed place, but Sarahs unshaking faith in God leads them ever closer to their goal. Even tragedy will not stop these pioneers, inspired by the American dream of freedom and greatness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
