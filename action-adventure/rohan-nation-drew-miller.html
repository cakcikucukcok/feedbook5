  <title>Rohan Nation - Drew Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;ROHAN NATION tells the compelling story of how survivors of biological and electro-magnetic pulse warfare fight to defend and reinvent America. The disasters that lead to the collapse of America in 2020, and billions of deaths worldwide, are based on sound research and analysis, the predictable results of on-going mistakes. ACE, the teenage daughter of a family that prepared for the worst, and Justin, the young refugee who becomes her cavalry scout apprentice, struggle to survive in a post-collapse economy where horses are key to survival.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Despite the dismal future forecast, Rohan Nation: Reinventing America after the 2020 Collapse provides an uplifting story of love and hope as ACE and Justin pursue their youthful romance while defending their community and rebuilding a responsible society. You will share their odyssey into life&amp;#39;s fundamental questions, moral and political issues, receiving powerful, moving insights into how we can live better now. This extraordinary story of survivors reinventing America will hopefully change the way people think and feel about not just politics, but how to lead their lives.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; While set as an action adventure, Rohan Nation is also a Libertarian political philosophy, an Atlas Shrugged call for a new &amp;ldquo;responsibility political philosophy&amp;rdquo; to break our nation&amp;rsquo;s addiction to socialist entitlements and return to Constitutional, strictly limited government, focused on security. It is America&amp;rsquo;s rebirth, realistically forecast in a future-thriller-action-romance novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
