He buys his first wheels, a 1941 Harley, in high school, a purchase that marks the beginning of his lifelong adventures on the seat of a motorcycle. Marco loves the feel of the wind in his face while exploring the countryside, always curious about what lays over the next hill or around the next curve in the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, twenty-five years old, in the middle of a rainstorm in Nowhere, New Mexico, Marco looks back on his life as a vagabond, journeying on a motorcycle that takes its course over majestic mountains and sparse desert scrub. He reminisces about his encounters with people who become a major part of his life; he finds himself involved with rogue police officers who almost kill him; and he meets some rough folks along with many friendly onesadding another chapter in lifes course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A work of fiction, Wanderlust shares one mans love of biking as he experiences all the world offers from the seat of a motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
