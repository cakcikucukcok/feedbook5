  <title>The Cry of a Child in the Nocturnal Darkness - Agrey Emile A. Coudakpo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The story of a child who cries for help in the dark in hopes of finding a way to the light, without knowing that he is part of that darkness and light himself. The child was born between two tribes: darkness tribe and lightning tribe. His mother, Adjo, wandered off from the darkness tribe to meet her lover, who was the childs father, Kafui, from the lightning tribe. They both knew their union could be fatal because of the differences of their tribes, but their love blinded them to know how different they were. Their inevitable love was rejected by both the darkness tribe and lightning tribe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried about the outcome of their forbidden love, they suddenly got scared and fled from the mistake they had made; the two lovers realized how their difference could not be reconciled. They both rejoined their tribes for fear of meeting again, but it was too late because the seed of their love already began to sprout into an unborn child. From their inevitable love came a newborn child who was a combination of the two tribes of darkness and lightning and whom the two tribes decided to eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an elderly woman in the darkness tribe named Pauline, who seemed to be the childs grandmother and who had supernatural powers that could balance both darkness and lightning. The elderly woman then secretly took the child for fear that both lightning and darkness tribes could destroy the child and that the mother could not balance the two combinations of darkness and lightning within the child and protect him at the same time. The elderly woman Pauline escaped to many different tribes to raise the child; she named the child Komla, meaning the birth of two strong powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up, Komla realized he was part of the darkness and the lightning tribes, who rejected him, and that he lost the only sparkle of light that cared and protected him. He felt lonely, and out of blame, he projected himself into a nocturnal darkness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
