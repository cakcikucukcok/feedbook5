      <meta name="description" content="After escaping her elementary school gym class, Shayna Gladstone is almost crushed by a giant hot air balloon. She makes the acquaintance of the Balloon Lady of Terramanna, and as fate would have it, Shayna is just the young girl shes been looking for! Terramanna is the world of fun, frivolity, and merriment; however, an Age of Gloom approaches, and only Shayna can stop it.
An ancient prophecy from the Terraman Oracle tells of a hero who will save Terramanna from the Age of Gloom. The foretold heros name is Shayna; could little Shayna Gladstone be the hero they seek? She agrees to go back to Terramanna with the Balloon Lady in her huge hot air balloon, but theres trouble when they arrive. A very famous scientist, Minnie Maudde, has gone missing 
They suspect the evil Falco, who is trying to bring about the imminent Age of Gloom. In order to restore fun and frivolity to Terramanna, Shayna must swallow her fears and find the scientist. Will she be brave enough to face Falco and save Terramanna? Her journey takes her into the depths of a new, magical world, and soon, it becomes personal, as Shayna realizes the Gladstone family has a big secret!" />
