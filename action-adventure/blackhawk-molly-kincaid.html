  <title>Blackhawk - Molly Kincaid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Toni Larson has a simple life. She works at a diner, and the world makes sense. When two men settle in at her table for breakfast one fateful day, however, this seemingly random meeting will change that simple lifeand everything she believes about her government, her human rights, and her futureforever.&lt;/p&gt;
Blackhawk and White Wolf are operatives for the Agency, the most closely held secret in a world of secrets. Outside of the elite group of agents themselves, a total of three people in the government are even aware of its very existence: the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, and the head of the Agency. The operatives who work for the Agency follow only one directive: do whatever it takes to get the job done, no matter what. Unsuspecting civilians are routinely enlisted for participation in covert operations in which using a trained operative is not feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
White Wolf suggests that Toni, a gorgeous redhead, would be perfect for their next mission, so Blackhawk starts to woo the unsuspecting waitressas a means to tricking her into assisting in the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
Soon, Toni finds herself inextricably drawn into a world of intrigue that will take her from her home in Atlanta to the Bahamas and to the forests of northern Maine. She leads a dangerous rescue mission into the Central American rainforest before ending up in the mysterious Black Hills of South Dakota, where she discovers a growing love for the dark and rugged Blackhawk." />
